Bitcoin Magazine,Give Me Time,"Mon, 09 Sep 2024 21:47:47 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/give-me-time,"On Bitcoin, Saturn and synchronicity. From ""The Privacy Issue""","This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine's ""The Privacy Issue"". Subscribe to receive your copy.With the Fourth Halving in the rearview mirror, it seems a perfect time to provide some on-record analysis of Bitcoin from the perspective of Number and Time, aka Crypto-K, which is the name for a methodology my friend and I have developed over the years in pursuit of a technical analysis of synchronicity — the sense that our reality is arranged according to some as yet undefined acausal ordering principle. The K stands for Kubrick, as in Stanley Kubrick, director of 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining, whose life and mysterious works of cinematic art are powerful strange attractors for synchronicity and high strangeness. It is the Monolith around which our methodology — and seemingly everything else — was built.Most reading this know that Bitcoin is an all-encompassing subject — a rabbit hole. Well, the same goes for Crypto-K, which in some respects is a study of everything, or how everything connects. And that everything includes Bitcoin. So you’re about to find out what happens when one rabbit hole intersects with another.How is Bitcoin related to Crypto-K?Both are about Time, or the problem with it. Crypto-K is about asking, “What is the meaning of Time’s Pace?” while Bitcoin is a new spin on the old saying “Time is Money”. How do we protect our MONEY from temporal entropy? On the other hand, how do we protect our TIME from monetary entropy?All of these concerns fall under the astro-alchemical rubric of Saturn, the seventh classical planet. The planet of laws, boundaries, inheritance, burdens: “the labor of existence, the harvest of time” (Tarnas). Here’s astrologer John Hughes, writing about Saturn: “It is the planet of real worth, as apart from show and make-believe, and gives to all things their permanent and lasting qualities. Its action is slow, thorough and inevitable.” This sounds a lot like the BTC timechain: slow, thorough, and inevitable, defined by its permanence and lasting qualities. Real worth — the labor of existence, the harvest of time, or, in other words, proof of work.Yes, Satoshi, Bitcoin is Saturnine, all right. Saturn has a peculiar history when viewed through the lens of fringe theory. In 1980 David Talbott published a book called The Saturn Myth which posited the idea that long ago a previous solar system arrangement had Saturn as the Earth’s primary star, before some terrible calamity occurred that threw everything out of whack. Maybe Talbott’s theory is whack, but there’s also Richard Hoagland (the “Face on Mars” guy), who has presented theories about Saturn, particularly its moon Iapetus, which he speculated might be an artificial body inhabited by extraterrestrials. It’s possible he regurgitated this from Arthur C. Clarke in the novelized version of 2001: A Space Odyssey, where in that book the climactic Monolith is found buried on Iapetus (not floating by Jupiter as in the film). But forget all that: Even the straight astronomers and scientists, for whom microbes in the dirt would be tremendously exciting, seem to think that Saturn (or rather, one of its moons) is the place to look when it comes to possible life within our solar system.The point is that your reality tunnel doesn’t matter: Saturn tends to dominate the frame. As the seventh and slowest-moving classical planet, it came to represent the outer limits of material reality itself. As such it was the secret destination of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey. The story goes that the special effects team had trouble creating a realistic Saturn, so they pivoted to Jupiter instead. It’s also the secret meaning of the title of Kubrick’s follow-up, A Clockwork Orange. The traditional read on that title is negative, meaning what a human being would become if he lost the ability to choose good over evil — something organic turned false and machine-like, a clockwork orange. It’s a hypothetical state of the human being denigrated under 21st-century pharmacracy. Bitcoin flips this script: What if something which began as a meaningless Saturnine process grew into a truth-affirming juggernaut imbued with analog richness but beyond the reach of any seething sovereign?Forget “A”. Bitcoin is the clockwork orange. But why orange?Bitcoin became the “orange coin” when the logo was finalized by anonymous BTC-talk user “bitboy” on 11/1/10, or the day after the second anniversary of Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin white paper. He had taken Satoshi’s original idea and cleaned it up, added a 14% twist, and decided to make the whole thing orange. Everyone agreed it was a perfect choice and it has remained in place ever since. The perfect choice of logo met with a perfect release date too, because that date can be reduced to 11110, as in the 1963 executive order issued by President Kennedy to issue silver certificates from the Treasury (occasionally cited by anti-Fed types as the reason JFK was assassinated). Here’s what we call a good old-fashioned sync. It’s possible that bitboy (whoever he was) released the logo on this day intentionally because he recognized the historical pun it would make, but more likely it just kind of happened that way as a grand micro-expression of that general acausal ordering principle mentioned above. It has a pointed sense of humor at times.Satoshi Nakamoto published the white paper on 10/31/2008 — in other words on Halloween. It’s possible that bitboy had Halloween on his mind when he decided on orange for the logo and released it two years later. Satoshi’s original logo was gold, but that crystallized into orange, perhaps as a way to give Bitcoin its own identity apart from the “shiny rock”. But it was an appropriate move to make from an alchemical perspective. In an essay from The Sync Book Vol. 2 called “Moon in the Middle”, writer Mark LeClair offers a gnostic interpretation of reality (and the color orange) based on a run of 7s: the 7 tones of the diatonic scale, the 7 days of the Gregorian week, and the 7 colors of the rainbow, which all come together to communicate the essential truth of Creation: The Moon is actually the center of everything, the crucified Christ holding reality together. According to LeClair, each day of the week and color correspond to a different planet and stage of the gnostic creation myth. The story begins with the color red and Venus on Friday, then continues to Saturday and Saturn, and of course, the next color on the spectrum, orange. “The color orange is associated with deceit and mistrust, pridefulness and passive assertiveness—a tiger, brimming with orange rage, striped and softly panting, glowering, lurking in the thickness of ferns, ready to pounce and consume the soul from the inside out. The color of gold is also a function of orange, and not of yellow as is the common misconception. Gold is the achievement of royalty and godhead through the act of alchemy, which is a process of Saturn.”As Ideal Money, true digital gold, the “orange coin” is an achievement in alchemy. The crowning achievement, perhaps, of “Cronos, the designer of Time, the Clockwork Orange… he is tough and resourceful, smart, too dangerous to dismiss as a mere force of blunt or banal evil… Feed him. Give the devil his due. Milk and cookies on the counter should do the trick.” This imposition to feed the beast might not be unlike the way Bitcoin must be “fed” with more and more electricity to power the global “macro-chip”. Not to compare Bitcoin to the devil or anything, but Satoshi did publish the white paper on All Hallow’s Eve — and wouldn’t you know it, the BTC timechain had been cranking away for exactly 666 days on Halloween 2010, aka the day before the famous orange logo was published.But there’s another, more spectacular way of connecting Bitcoin to 666 with the calendar. Satoshi gave the public a birth date for himself when he registered with the P2P Foundation: 4/5/1975, also known as the 42nd anniversary of FDR’s EO6102 that unilaterally confiscated U.S. citizen’s private gold holdings. In the late 1980s, there was an issue of The Economist featuring the headline, “Get ready for a world currency” backed by a “Golden Eagle” atop a pile of flaming fiat money (an image much loved by conspiracy theorists over the years). The cover date for this issue was 1/9/1988.This means that Satoshi Nakamoto was exactly 666 weeks old on the day of The Economist’s “world currency” issue. The magazine came well before Bitcoin ever existed. Did Satoshi know this when he “chose” his birth date?Does it seem a little threatening to you? Consider the following facts. There are 7 days in one week. This means that in 6 weeks there are 42 days. This means that in 666 weeks there are 42×111 days. Now, 666 is supposed to be a bad number right? But 42 is kind of a funny, happy number, right? So don’t think of Satoshi being 666 weeks old on the day of The Economist’s world currency issue, but instead that he was 4,242 + 420 days old! See, The Book of Revelation designates 666 as the “number of the Beast”. But notice how something as ordinary as the clockface secretly communicates it right in front of you all the time: three overlapping hands — 60 seconds, 60 minutes, 24 (6) hours. The number of the Beast is the number of the Clock. 666 is the Fourth Seal of Crypto-K. The Beast is time, ruled by Saturn. Nothing to be afraid of, though, especially now that we have Bitcoin.In pursuit of the analysis of synchronicity, we employ what we call the parent-thesis, a dialectical configuration where two points in time (“parents”) generate a third (the “child”) via the exact midpoint between them. Whether it be the midpoint of a person’s life’s or the midpoint between two deaths or two movie releases, it creates a static synchronicity that can be studied and, perhaps, classified. In the case of the birth of Satoshi Nakamoto and the cover date of The Economist world currency issue, the two dates 666 weeks apart generate a midpoint 333 weeks either way of 8/22/1981 — and this happens to be the day that NASA’s Voyager 2 probe made its approach to Iapetus, kicking off its encounter with Saturn. This fly-by first clued astronomers into the existence of the equatorial ridge on Iapetus, which now ranks as the third tallest mountain structure in the entire solar system.In keeping with the theme, 8/22/1981 also saw the release of a horror B movie called Evilspeak in which Ron Howard’s brother Clint Howard plays a nerd named Stanley Coopersmith (= 237, standard gematria), who stumbles onto the laboratory of a sixteenth-century warlock in the basement of his military academy, then uses his computer skills to summon the Devil in order to enact revenge on the kids who bully him. The opening scene has the bullies calling him “Stanley Cooperdick”, making the Stanley Kubrick comparisons even more obvious. Here we have a Stanley using computer technology to interface with Satan (a kind of artificial intelligence), and commandeering it to do his bidding — in a film released on the day Voyager 2 begins its encounter with Saturn and photographs the moon Iapetus (we’re told) — and on the mid-point of the 666 weeks between Satoshi’s birthday and The Economist’s “get ready for a world currency” issue. As the “clockwork orange”, Bitcoin could be seen metaphorically as a new form of artificial life, a new element “conjured” with computers — a decentralized phoenix rising from the ashes of centralization: Satoshi Nakamoto.It’s in Douglas Adams’ Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy that a powerful artificial intelligence in the future is built to answer the question of “life, the universe, and everything”, and comes back after millions of years of processing with the answer 42 — which we call the First Seal of Crypto-K. Satoshi loved 42 and originally wanted the total supply of Bitcoin to be 42 million, but cut it to 21 for economic reasons — then there’s the halving every 210,000 blocks (that’s two halvings per 420,000 blocks). Whether he meant to or not, Satoshi first announced his creation to the P2P Foundation forum on the 42nd day of 2009.Then there’s also the difficulty adjustment — which some say is Satoshi’s stroke of genius — every 2,016 blocks. Satoshi could have made the adjustment every 2,100 blocks, mirroring the supply cap and halving schedule. Instead, he chose 2,016, a number that was 42 + 42 less than 2,100. There is a mundane explanation for this and then there are several more exciting explanations for this. Was it because 2016 is 6102 — the number of FDR’s gold confiscation order, issued 42 years before Satoshi’s birthday — backward? It could have been because 2016 reduces to 216 which is 6 x 6 x 6 and kabbalistically significant. Or it might simply have been because this made for a difficulty adjustment every 14 days instead of every 14.58333 days. It’s all of the above: Satoshi was carefully synchronizing his creation with the clock and the calendar, i.e., with the movement of the heavens. Thus it naturally fell into the prescribed order of time’s pace, which it is the purview of Crypto-K to analyze and unwind.Of course, there’s always another sync, and always another opportunity to misinterpret the sync as evidence of conspiracy. Because events occurred in the year 2016 that are indelibly stitched into the timechain of history and retroactively make Satoshi’s choice somewhat conspicuous. Chiefly, it’s 11/9/2016, the election of Donald Trump — the orange man — for U.S. President. But on the inverse date, 9/11/2016, Hillary Clinton appeared to collapse and was tossed like a side of beef into a van that then sped away. It was interpreted by some at the time to have been the effects wrought by 4chan autists and meme-pirates unintentionally invoking an ancient Egyptian frog deity called “Kek”. This then sparked an influential online movement with a food-related name we won’t even mention that subsequently morphed into (or was co-opted by) the Q operation that officially began a year later. Did Satoshi have foreknowledge of the year in which The Plan™ was to begin and encode it into Bitcoin? Probably not, but it was encoded there nonetheless.Another more salient example of “2016” encoding has to do with the late JFK Jr., who died in a plane crash with his wife on 7/16/1999 — the day on which Stanley Kubrick’s posthumous film Eyes Wide Shut was contractually obligated to be released. JFK Jr.’s death figures heavily into the lore of some Q-adjacent conspiracy merchants, who have lately deployed the narrative that, with his friend Donald Trump’s help, JFK Jr. actually faked his death in 1999 and is set to return when the time is right. Oh boy, where have we ever heard that one before? But that’s not to say there isn’t legit weirdness there, because here’s my point: John-John was born on 11/25/1960 and died on 7/16/1999, which means that his entire life lasted for exactly 2,016 weeks.If you make John-John’s 2,016-week lifespan a parent-thesis and divide it to find the midpoint, exactly 1,008 weeks into his life was 3/21/1980, the day the TV show Dallas aired its season 3 finale, “A House Divided”, which featured the cliff-hanger death by gunshot of the show’s star J.R. Ewing — one of the most iconic moments in TV history. “Who shot JR on Dallas?” became the question on TV in 1980 in the way that “Who shot JFK in Dallas?” became the question of 1963 — and JFK Jr.’s death occurred such that this episode — a cheeky re-enactment of the Father’s death — aired on the midpoint of the life of the Son.*If* JFK Jr. faked his death, he apparently did so in such a way that his official fake lifespan silently communicated the future year in which his friend would be elected president, and also pointed to a TV episode referencing his Father’s death. Why the hell would anyone do that, though? Forget the clickbait conspiracy slop. JFK Jr. is dead as a doornail, and more and more it feels like nobody is choosing to do any of this stuff consciously. Again, we are looking at the acausal ordering principle that Carl Gustav Jung discussed in his book Synchronicity — or something along the lines of VALIS, put forth by Philip K. Dick in the wake of his revelatory experiences/temporal lobe seizure which he codenamed 2-3-74. Apparently, different people and events are or can be products of the same underlying operating principle, i.e., VALIS, the salvific entity that is here transforming our world and using us as its implements in doing so.Orange man, meet orange coin. Is it a match made in heaven? Not so far, though recently the man has softened his tune on the coin after basically denouncing it during his presidency. Here’s what you didn’t know: The orange man’s presidency was inaugurated on 1/20/2017, which was exactly 420 weeks after the orange coin was inaugurated in the Genesis block on 1/3/2009. It would seem that there might be something deeper connecting these two than just the color — after all, Trump isn’t really orange just like Bitcoin isn’t really orange either. In both cases, it’s the brand. Trump’s critics (and his fans) have often remarked how he could shoot someone in broad daylight and get away with it — a hyperbole to emphasize how he resists or repels criticism. In other words, he can survive anything, and can usually spin any negative energy sent his way into a positive outcome. It’s not unlike the way Bitcoiners often say that “everything is good for Bitcoin”. It’s that everlasting Saturnine quality behind both phenomena — or maybe it is just something about the color orange.If you count the weeks instead from the Bitcoin white paper to Trump’s inauguration it’s 429, which is 666 - 237. This means that 237 weeks before the white paper was 666 weeks before the Trump inauguration, and likewise 666 weeks after the white paper was 237 weeks after Trump’s inauguration. Did Satoshi plan that? Perhaps he did, or perhaps that is only a side-effect of some deeper process unplanned by anyone, what you might call a decentralized signal hidden in the noise.There are more calendar connections between orange man and orange coin. For instance, Satoshi’s “birthday” on 4/5/1975 was the day after 4/4/1975, when Donald Trump became 1,503 weeks old on the same day Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded their company Microsoft. 153 is the Second Seal of Crypto-K, and one of the most important and mysterious numbers in existence all on its own. Coincidentally or not, this particular span of time — 1,503 weeks — lines up closely with what’s known to astrologers as the Saturn Return, when the planet makes a full orbit and returns to where it was in the sky at birth. This will often coincide with a person’s coming into adulthood in one form or another (a phenomenon known to most people as turning 30). During this period of his life, Donald Trump was embroiled with his father in a lawsuit for civil rights violations.Actor Heath Ledger who died on 1/22/2008, was born four years after Microsoft (on 4/4/1979), which means he was exactly 1,503 weeks old when he died.For Trump it was the full legal weight of Uncle Sam that came down on his head — in Ledger’s case, Saturn came home to roost in the form of death by an accidental overdose (or so we are told). According to NASA the actual length of Saturn’s orbit in days is 10,756. The day on which Heath Ledger would have been 10,756 days old was 9/14/2008, aka the 237th day after he died! Let it be known then that this timespan we’re highlighting — 1,503 weeks — is actually 237 days shy of a full orbit of Saturn! 237 is the Third Seal of Crypto-K, spotlighted by Stanley Kubrick in The Shining and, together with 153, they solder the orange man’s Saturn Return to the birth of orange coin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.So Satoshi Nakamoto was “born” the day after Donald Trump turned 1,503 weeks old (the same day Microsoft was “born”), 42 years after EO6102 — and the Bitcoin Genesis block was mined 420 weeks before Trump took the oath of office. Then Satoshi registered the website for his incoming digital ledger on 8/18/2008, exactly 210 days after the death of Heath Ledger. This was precisely 1,053 weeks after Donald Trump turned 42.Donald Trump’s first Monday in office as President — 1/23/2017 — was also what we call his K-Day, or the same age Stanley Kubrick was when he died. The Bitcoin white paper was published 3,006 or 1,503 + 1,503 days before Trump’s K-Day. What makes this truly remarkable is the midpoint: 12/12/2012, the day that someone using the name Nicholas von Saberhagen published the white paper for what would eventually become the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero. Some have speculated that there might be a connection between Satoshi and Saberhagen (SN/NS). This information was reported by “MoneroOutreach” in what appears to have been an April Fool’s joke on 4/1/2020. A fact is that Satoshi made his final forum post on 12/12/2010, meaning Saberhagen published the CryptoNote white paper on a two-year “delta” with Satoshi’s final message, not unlike how the orange logo was published only hours after the two-year “delta” of the Satoshi white paper.Anyone who has read Infinite Jest knows that April Fool’s day can carry serious undertones (especially in spycraft). It would be a mistake to discount this report as totally worthless. The tone seems off somehow, like it’s a joke being told by someone who knows it’s not a joke, but needs it to seem like it is, while also communicating (with no hands) the underlying truth — that Satoshi and Saberhagen were one and the same.This deliberately paced article mentions three specific dates — two we already know from the first paragraph, and then in the fourth paragraph, “August 13, 2010”, the day of a forum post by Satoshi first referencing the privacy tech that would eventually be implemented into Monero. The magic of this day becomes apparent when you check it against the BTC Genesis block — 42 + 42 weeks apart, meaning it’s also in a 42-week line-up with the Trump inauguration 336 weeks ahead (aka 77 months, 7 days!), which is a remarkable parallel with Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment every 336 hours. In other words Satoshi’s first mention of ring signatures came 420 - 42 - 42 weeks before the Trump inauguration, similar to the difficulty adjustment every 2,100 - 42 - 42 blocks.The report from MoneroOutreach on 4/1/2020 was published exactly 20 days, 3 months, and 7 years after the Saberhagen white paper — but further fuel for the conspiratorial fire is that it was also day 1,776 after the death of legendary mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr. and his wife Alicia in a car crash on the New Jersey turnpike on 5/23/2015. John Nash — who you might remember as being played by Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind — remains one of the more intriguing under-the-radar candidates for the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto due to his singular genius in all the requisite fields. Forgetting the Oscar-winning cartoon for a moment, the real John Nash was a visionary-grade cryptologist, mathematician, and game theorist who harbored a lifelong interest in applied economics (not to mention programming and the internet). Late in his life (in the early 2000s) he lectured and wrote on the subject of Ideal Money, and was publicly concerned with countering the mounting effects of decades of inflationary Keynesian monetary policy. We can theoretically surmise that the people in charge of implementing Nash’s ideas from above wouldn’t have been too keen on the concept of ideal money (Bitcoin). In order for it to work it would anyway have had to be released “in a roundabout way” (as Hayek suggested). So was born Satoshi Nakamoto, an alter-ego for a man already haunted by voices — and so went he, out of the window of his taxi, once his managers finally realized what he had done. That’s if you buy the theory, at least.It’s highly speculative conjecture backed mostly by synchronistic evidence, but hear it out anyway. In Clint Howard’s brother Ron Howard’s 2001 film A Beautiful Mind, John Nash was played by Russell Crowe, while his wife Alicia (in real life an honored native citizen of El Salvador, funnily enough) was played by Jennifer Connelly. In the film we see Connelly/Alicia as a devoted wife standing by her husband as he wrestles with his “demons” while carrying out work he believes he has been singled out to perform by a ‘higher authority’. That film released in December 2001 — but 13 years later the acausal ordering principle struck once more when Crowe and Connelly were cast as husband and wife again, this time in Darren Aronofsky’s 2014 Biblical epic Noah, where we again see Connelly as a devoted wife who stands by her whacko husband as he wrestles with his demons and carries out work he believes he has been singled out to perform by a higher authority. Noah and Nash are a lot alike, are they not?What work was that again? Oh yes, building the Ark, an engineering project from God to allow humanity and the animals to endure the incoming deluge. Any Bitcoiner worth their salt has already understood the parallel. The orange coin has been referred to as a financial Noah’s Ark on more than one occasion, seemingly engineered (by God, of course) to help humanity stave off an inflationary financial apocalypse, and Nash has emerged (independently) as one candidate for the anonymous builder of that financial Ark. It’s a theory bolstered synchronistically by how the same actors that played Nash and his wife in a Hollywood film, later played Noah and his wife in a Hollywood film about building the Biblical Ark! Again the dichotomy presents itself: Does this represent intentional encoding of media by Hollywood filmmakers and producers, or is it an example of Jung’s acausal ordering principle, where humans can’t help but make certain decisions, telling on ourselves over and over? Good luck getting a consensus on that question.So, again, the 4/1/2020 report on the Satoshi/Saberhagen matter was published 1,776 days after John Nash and his wife died on 5/23/2015. If there’s anything to compare this to it’s that likewise, Queen Elizabeth’s death on 9/8/2022 arrived 1,776 days after the inaugural Q drop. 1776 was spotlighted by the founding of the USA that year and is the Fifth Seal of Crypto-K, so these are syncs, to be sure, but it’s possible — if however infinitesimally — that all of these items are related on a material level. John Nash remains one of the most convincing candidates for the mantle of Satoshi (even without the Hollywood casting magic) and this April Fool’s dispatch was suspiciously well-timed against his death, which, at this point, might as well be deemed an assassination. It feels like the universe has a secret to tell us, and is using us as its implements to do so.There’s another temporal tell tying Nash’s possible assassination on 5/23/2015 to Bitcoin: It happened exactly 333 weeks after the Genesis block. In other words, Nash died when the Bitcoin timechain was half of 666 weeks old. If Nash was assassinated for his secret work on Bitcoin, the people who did it would probably go about timing it perfectly according to their secret midnight rituals, and this might be evidence of that — they love their 3s. Or it could be evidence of something else.Nash died 333 weeks after the Genesis block — so we ask what happened 333 weeks before the Genesis block, or 666 weeks before Nash died? That day is 8/17/2002, a Saturday. The synchronicity that must be remarked on here is how that weekend (Friday, or the beginning of that week, as Mark LeClair would have us believe) a movie was released starring Eddie Murphy called The Adventures of Pluto Nash. Taking place on the Moon in the year 2087, Murphy plays Pluto Nash, an ex-con trying to run a successful lunar nightclub all while evading the lunar mafia. Despite the decent cast, the film was a horrendous bomb, but the universe often uses bombs like these to conceal its deeper truths. Pluto represents Hades, or death itself, so the combination of Pluto and Nash in the title character of a film (in which Nash is being hunted by the “Mafia” who wish to kill him) released 666 weeks before the car crash that killed John Nash and his wife — with the BTC Genesis block at the midpoint. It more than bears mentioning. It’s downright freaky.Another detail about John Nash that adheres to the architecture of Crypto-K is that he was born in the same year as Stanley Kubrick — 1928. In fact, Nash’s birthday 6/13/1928 and Kubrick’s birthday 7/26/1928 together bracket a span of only 42 days. The Shining received wide release on 6/13/1980, but it premiered three weeks earlier on 5/23/1980, which means that The Shining released on John Nash’s 52nd birthday, while Nash and his wife were car-crashed 35 years after The Shining premiered — 35 years being exactly 420 months, and 52 years being 666 - 42 months. In other words, when a person turns 52, they are one “reign of the Beast” (Rev 13:5) away from 666 months old.The exact midpoint of John Nash’s life hit on 12/3/71. See it? The 237? Since we’re comparing Nash to Kubrick, we can provide the ready-made knowledge that Kubrick’s life midpoint arrived on 11/15/1963 — one week before the JFK assassination.Do you want to guess how much time passed from Stanley Kubrick’s midpoint to John Nash’s midpoint?Exactly 420 weeks. The same length of time as from the Genesis block to the inauguration of Donald Trump! What’s more, the day of Nash’s midpoint — 12/3/71 — was the same day the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki premiered his De Natura Sonoris No. 2, music which would later be incorporated by Stanley Kubrick into The Shining! Could this get any more convoluted? Of course, it’s that symmetry thing again, drawing what we call a parent-thesis: Nash’s midpoint arrived 420 weeks after Kubrick’s midpoint, so what happened 420 weeks before Kubrick’s midpoint? You’ll never guess, so it’s 10/28/1955, the birthday of Bill Gates, who has already been mentioned in connection with the founding of Microsoft the day before Satoshi Nakamoto’s “birthday!” Small world, hey?In A Beautiful Mind, Jennifer Connelly plays a beleaguered wife who, in trying to protect her child, stumbles onto her crazy husband’s papers which prove that he’s schizophrenic. That’s a virtual mirror to The Shining where Shelley Duvall plays a beleaguered wife who, in trying to protect her child, stumbles onto her husband’s private papers which prove that he’s insane. According to Mark LeClair again, Jack Torrance represents Saturn, the demiurge, the “master of time”, an archetype Kubrick also applied to himself via the backstage documentary shot by his daughter Vivian Kubrick, where we see them dressing alike, dramatically typing away at a typewriter, and even hassling “Wendy” — aka Shelley Duvall. Kubrick wanted us to see him squarely equating himself with the character of Jack Torrance — i.e., Saturn. So it would seem that in the year 2001 the character of John Nash in A Beautiful Mind also was overlapped by the same Saturnine trope as Jack and Kubrick in The Shining — and then it happened again with Noah in Noah! It’s almost like the universe (or VALIS) was trying to tell us something, and this is how it speaks.Nash’s birth brackets 42 days with Kubrick’s birth, and the midpoint of Nash’s life on 12/3/71 came 420 weeks after Kubrick’s life’s midpoint.So what about the end of their lives?If you go look it up, you’ll find that Nash died 846 weeks after Kubrick, a figure which amounts to 420 + 420 weeks, plus 42 days.Who exactly is doing all this, and why?One person who was verifiably involved in the beginnings of Bitcoin was of course Hal Finney, who was right there to help Satoshi along when the first BTC client launched on 1/9/09, and he was there to receive the first BTC transaction from Satoshi in block 170 on 1/11/09 — which, by the way, occurred exactly 153 + 153 + 153 weeks before the first post from another anonymous internet entity, Q (the 17th letter), on 10/28/2017.Hal Finney’s birth on 5/4/1956 means that on the day of the Bitcoin Genesis block, he was 19,237 days old. Here we have the Third Seal, 237, combined with what we call the “Ruler” — 19. One property of 19 that remains relevant is how it alphanumerically translates to AI, the abbreviation for artificial intelligence, now positioned as the existential threat of our time. Some Bitcoiners have wildly claimed that BTC represents the counterbalancing force required by nature for humanity to resist AI’s eventual total liquid control of all centralized systems, though none of them have been clear on the specifics of how that might work. But in this regard — BTC vs. AI — the name “Hal Finney” carries certain connotations, because “Hal” is the name of Kubrick’s malevolent AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey: HAL 9000. “Finney” could be read as finis, for finished, as in “HAL finished” — AI finished.What’s in a name? In this case, perhaps the sum total of a man’s mission on earth.It was noticed early on that Stanley Kubrick’s death on 3/7/1999 occurred 666 days before 1/1/2001. It took some time for Crypto-K to come along and ask, What happened 666 days before Kubrick died? The answer turned out to be the day that chess grandmaster Gary Kasparov lost a match to the computer Deep Blue, making it the first time that the best human had lost to an artificial intelligence in match-play chess — much the same way that Frank Poole lost to HAL in the film. Compounding the sync is that the computer Deep Blue was built by IBM, and modeled after the Monolith from 2001!The trope continues to express itself: Man vs. Machine, in a chess match for all the marbles, with history itself the board for the Game of All Time.Is Bitcoin someone’s idea of checkmate?Satoshi Nakamoto appeared in digital public for the last time 15 years to the day after Kubrick died — with a message that read “I am not Dorian Nakamoto” — and then exited the stage for good, much like Flight MH370 which disappeared along with Satoshi less than 24 hours later. Satoshi’s final message on 3/7/2014 meant that the total time elapsed from his first published word to his final published word was 279 or 42 + 237 weeks. Hal Finney would find his own end later that year, succumbing to ALS on 8/28/2014, 4,200 hours after Satoshi’s final post — and John and Alicia Nash would be taken less than nine months after that.His death on 8/28/2014 meant that Hal Finney’s life’s midpoint occurred around 7/1/1985 — a scant 42 hours before the release of Back to the Future, a movie about a plan to use time-travel technology to stop a “terrorist” attack and break a temporal curse.We know Bitcoin is the clockwork orange, but could it also be the flux capacitor?Maybe what you’ve read here seems to you like the ravings of a man who has not been properly medicated. But hopefully some shards of this screed will stick in your temporal lobe anyway and in a few weeks or months you’ll be compelled for one reason or another to think about it again, and say, “Huh, maybe that number freak was onto something”. We’ll see.The Fourth Halving took effect on 4/19/2024, when the BTC timechain was exactly 19 × 42 weeks old — the Ruler (AI) meets the First Seal and the orange coin, a showdown for life, the universe, and everything.Perhaps Satoshi planned that one ahead of time as well, but even if not, he would have loved how perfectly it all worked out."

Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Rollups - The Rock Or The Hard Place?,"Mon, 09 Sep 2024 16:13:00 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-rollups-the-rock-or-the-hard-place,"A look at the scalability limits of rollups, and the choices in making decisions regarding maximizing it.","Rollups have become the narrative focus of scaling Bitcoin lately, becoming the first thing to truly “steal the limelight” from the Lightning Network in terms of wider mindshare. Rollups aim to be an off-chain layer two that is not bound or constrained by the liquidity limitations that are central to the Lightning Network, i.e. end users required someone allocate (or “lend”) them funds ahead of time in order to be able to receive money, or intermediary routing nodes requiring channel balances that can facilitate the movement of the payment amount all the way from sender to receiver. These systems were originally developed to function on Ethereum and other Turing complete systems, but as of late the focus has shifted to porting them to UTXO based blockchains such as Bitcoin. This article is not going to discuss the current state of things being implemented on Bitcoin currently, but going to discuss the function of an idealized rollup that people are aiming for in the long term depending on features Bitcoin currently does not support, namely the ability to verify Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) on Bitcoin directly. The basic architecture of a roll is as follows: a single account (or in Bitcoin’s case UTXO), holds the balances of all users in the rollup. This UTXO contains a commitment in the form of a merkle root of a merkle tree that commits to all the current balances of existing accounts in the rollup. All of these accounts are authorized using public/private key pairs, so in order to propose an off-chain spend a user must still sign something with a key. This part of the structure allows users to leave without permission whenever they want, simply by crafting a transaction proving their account is part of the merkle tree, they can unilaterally exit the rollup without the operator's permission. The operator of the rollup must include a ZKP in transactions that update the merkle root of account balances on-chain in the process of finalizing off-chain transactions, without this ZKP the transaction will be invalid and therefore not includable in the blockchain. This proof allows people to verify that all changes to off-chain accounts were properly authorized by the account holder(s), and that the operator has not conducted a malicious update of balances to steal money from users or reallocate it to other users dishonestly. The problem is, if only the root of the merkle tree is posted on-chain where users can view and access it, how do they get their branch in the tree in order to be capable of exiting without permission when they want to? Proper RollupsIn a proper rollup, the information is put directly into the blockchain everytime that new off-chain transactions are confirmed and the state of the rollup accounts change. Not the entire tree, that would be absurd, but the information necessary to reconstruct the tree. In a naive implementation, the summary of all existing accounts in the rollup would have balances and accounts simply added in the transaction updating the rollup.In more advanced implementations, a balance diff is used. This is essentially a summary of what accounts have had money added to or subtracted from them during the course of an update. This allows each rollup update to only include the changes to account balances that occur. Users can then simply scan the chain and “do the math” from the beginning of the rollup to arrive at the current state of account balances, which allows them to reconstruct the merkle tree of current balances. This saves a lot of overhead and blockspace (and therefore money) while still allowing users to guarantee access to the information needed for them to exit unilaterally. Including this data in a formal rollup that uses the blockchain to make it available to users is mandated by the rules of the rollup, i.e. a transaction that does not include the account summary or account diff is considered an invalid transaction. ValidiumsThe other way to handle the problem of data availability for users to withdraw is to put the data somewhere else besides the blockchain. This introduces subtle issues, the rollup still needs to enforce that the data was made available somewhere else. Traditionally other blockchains are used for this purpose, specifically designed to function as data availability layers for systems like rollups. This creates the dilemma of security guarantees being as strong. When the data is posted directly to the Bitcoin blockchain, consensus rules can guarantee it is correct with absolute certainty. However when it is posted to an external system, the best it can do is verify an SPV proof that the data was posted to another system. This entails verifying an attestation that data exists on other chains, which is ultimately an oracle problem. Bitcoin’s blockchain cannot verify anything completely except what occurs on its own blockchain, the best it can do is verify a ZKP. A ZKP however cannot verify that a block containing rollup data was actually publicly broadcast after being produced. It cannot verify that external information is actually publicly available to everyone. This opens the door to data withholding attacks, where a commitment to the data being published is created and used to advance the rollup, but the data is not actually made available. This renders users funds beyond their ability to withdraw. The only real solution to this is to depend entirely on the value and incentive structure of systems completely external to Bitcoin. The Rock and Hard PlaceThis creates a dilemma in terms of rollups. When it comes to the data availability issue, there is essentially a binary choice between posting the data to the Bitcoin blockchain or somewhere else. This choice has massive implications for both rollup security and sovereignty, as well as their scalability. On one hand, using the Bitcoin blockchain for the data availability layer introduces a hard ceiling on how much rollups can scale. There is only so much blockspace, and that puts an upper limit on how many rollups can exist at one time and how many transactions all rollups in aggregate can process off-chain. Every rollup update requires blockspace proportional to the amount of accounts that have had balance changes since the last update. Information theory only allows data to be compressed so much, and at that point there is no more potential for scaling gains. On the other hand, using a different layer for data availability removes the hard ceiling on scalability gains, but it also introduces new security and sovereignty issues. In a rollup using Bitcoin for data availability it is literally not possible for the state of the rollup to change without the data needed by users to withdraw being atomically posted to the blockchain. With Validiums, that guarantee depends entirely on the ability of whatever external system is being used to resist gaming and data withholding. Any block producer on the external data availability system is now capable of holding Bitcoin rollup users’ funds hostage by producing a block and not actually broadcasting it to make the data available. So which will it be, if we ever do get to an ideal rollup implementation on Bitcoin that actually enables unilateral user withdrawal? The rock, or the hard place? "

Bitcoin Magazine,Japan's Largest Power Company TEPCO is Mining Bitcoin Using Renewables,"Mon, 09 Sep 2024 09:43:43 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/japans-largest-power-company-tepco-is-mining-bitcoin-using-renewables,"Japan's largest power company TEPCO has begun mining Bitcoin through its subsidiary using excess renewable energy, showing how Bitcoin can incentivize green energy growth.","Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), Japan's largest electricity provider, has begun mining Bitcoin through its subsidiary Agile Energy X using excess renewable energy that would otherwise be wasted, as per reports from Asahi.JUST IN: 🇯🇵 Japan's largest power company TEPCO is mining #Bitcoin using surplus energy. pic.twitter.com/ZrsmbV7mv6— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 9, 2024

With over 27 million residential and business customers, TEPCO established Agile Energy in 2022, and now they are exploring Bitcoin mining powered by surplus renewable energy. The subsidiary has installed mining rigs next to solar farms in Japan's Gunma and Tochigi prefectures.The initiative helps reduce wasted green energy from solar and wind farms that are forced to curtail production to avoid overloading Japan's grid. This energy is now being diverted to generate Bitcoin.""Green energy producers have to operate their businesses on the assumption that part of the power they generate is wasted,"" said Agile Energy President Kenji Tateiwa. ""If bitcoins were to provide a new source of income for similar power producers, who are being exposed to overinvestments, that would prompt more green energy to be introduced.""The project shows how Bitcoin mining can incentivize renewable energy growth by providing producers with additional revenue streams. Tateiwa said Bitcoin profits could encourage further investment in clean energy to power the mining.Other countries are also tapping excess renewables for Bitcoin mining, like El Salvador, which uses its geothermal energy. This dispels the myth that Bitcoin is environmentally hazardous, as much mining uses energy that would otherwise be wasted. More and more companies and countries are figuring out how to turn waste and surplus energy into the hardest money on earth.

Anthony’s Chief of Staff (R); Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine (D) and Kate Rouch, Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) at Coinbase, amongst others. Rapper and singer 070 Shake and Las Vegas-based DJ 3LAU performed at the event.The common threads in the rhetoric of the speakers and performers at the event were that crypto is here to stay, Nevada will be a home for the crypto industry and that the crypto vote matters deeply in Nevada, a swing state with a population of just over 3.1 million in which the 2024 Presidential election vote differential was only 33,516.Ensuring Victory for Pro-Crypto Candidates in Nevada“We need to ensure that our policymakers and the leaders we elect are those that embrace what we believe in,” Pamintuan, a crypto investor since 2015, told the audience.“And so in this coming election cycle, especially here in Nevada, elections are going to be won or lost by 1 or 2 percentage points. That’s about 15,000 to 30,000 votes,” he added.“When you add up how many people in our state are investors in crypto, that number is far greater than the margin of victory.”Far greater is an understatement, as 385,000 Nevadans own crypto, according to the Stand With Crypto Alliance. This number was plastered across screens at the event for the entirety of the evening.“In my business, we always say the market will decide,” began Conine.“Well, guess what, folks? You're the market, and your vote matters. Elections in this state are always very close, and they're not close because everybody votes and both sides are even. They're close because some people vote, but a lot of people stay home,” he added, before urging those in the audience who weren’t registered to vote to do so while stressing that the crypto vote can sway the ballot in upcoming elections at both the state and federal levels.Rouch, a resident of Nevada, also issued a call to action from the stage.“We need you guys this election,” she said.“It is critically important to figure out where the politicians in your district, in the state, stand on crypto — to really ask them the hard questions — and to tell your friends and family to get out there and vote.”Nevada as a Home to the Bitcoin and Crypto Industry“Las Vegas is a city of opportunity — above and beyond the casino floors,” shared Vinuya from the stage.“Nevada is home to an emerging center of technology and financial innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth,” he added before citing that the Governor’s Office of Economic Development facilitated $5 billion in economic investment last year and that the state saw 4% job growth in the same time period.

Part of this trend was fueled by Nevada’s embrace of the crypto industry.“Amidst all of these exciting achievements under the leadership of Governor Lombardo and Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman, Nevada has also become a home for innovators in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency,” he explained.Vinuya then pointed out that next year’s Bitcoin conference will be based in Las Vegas.“Here in our state, we have a good concept coined by Governor Lombardo called ‘the Nevada way,’ which means that as Nevadans, we never give up, we never give in, and we never stop dreaming,” he concluded. “The spirit of the Nevada Way is alive and well in the Bitcoin community, and we welcome your innovation and big dreams in Nevada.”Capitalizing on Political MomentumAccording to Rouch, we’ve hit the point of no return with crypto, and politicians can no longer afford to not take a stance on the issue, which is why Coinbase supports the Stand With Crypto Alliance.“What we're really saying here is ‘pay attention,’” Rouch told Bitcoin Magazine. “This matters to a lot of voters.”After citing that 52 million Americans of varied backgrounds, ethnicities and socioeconomic status now own crypto, Rouch explained that politicians, up the federal level, now see how big of an issue this is and are acting accordingly.“We've seen undeniable change in Washington, DC over the last year from both parties,” she said.“We had FIT21 pass in the House with a bipartisan vote. That was really unprecedented. We also have politicians making their statements on crypto known for the first time, and I feel very optimistic about that,” she added.Rouch wasn’t the only speaker or performer at the event feeling optimistic.Before beginning his DJ set, 3LAU told the story of how he met the Winklevoss twins, early bitcoin buyers and owners of the Gemini crypto exchange, at a gig a decade ago. He shared how they explained what Bitcoin was to him at that event, and that it gave him hope.

“Bitcoin changed my life, and it’s been that way for the past 10 years,” said 3LAU to the crowd before he started his DJ set.“This election is probably the most important in my life. We have a choice — to make the future of the financial system or follow the legacy bullshit that we’ve had to put up with,” he added.“And we’re all going to fucking vote for crypto.”"
Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin's Potential Rally Amid U.S. Dollar Weakness,"Fri, 06 Sep 2024 14:03:22 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoins-potential-rally-amid-u-s-dollar-weakness,Analyzing the recent drop in the Dollar Strength Index and its implications for Bitcoin.,"Bitcoin and the U.S. dollar have a long-standing inverse correlation, notably when observing the Dollar Strength Index (DXY). When the dollar weakens, Bitcoin often gains strength, and this dynamic might now be setting the stage for restarting the BTC bull cycle.DXYThe Dollar Strength Index (DXY) measures the value of the U.S. dollar against a basket of other major global currencies. Historically, a declining DXY has often coincided with significant rallies in Bitcoin's price. Conversely, when the DXY is on the rise, Bitcoin tends to enter a bearish phase.

Figure 1: Bitcoin and DXY have historically been inversely correlated. View Live Chart 🔍

We have recently seen a significant decline in the DXY, which could be signaling a shift toward a more risk-on environment in financial markets. Typically, such a shift is favorable for assets like Bitcoin. Despite this downturn in the DXY, Bitcoin's price has remained relatively stagnant, raising questions about whether BTC might soon experience a catch-up rally.

Figure 2: Recent downturn in DXY. View Live Chart 🔍

Sentiment ShiftingCoinciding with the decrease in demand for the U.S. dollar, the high-yield credit data suggests increasing demand for higher-yielding corporate bonds. This indicates that investors are more eager to obtain outsized returns, and historically this appetite has resulted in more significant capital inflows and higher prices as a result for Bitcoin.

Figure 3: High Yield Credit demand is increasing, indicating a shift to a more ‘risk-on’ sentiment. View Live Chart 🔍

Lagging Behind?In comparison, the S&P 500 has seen substantial growth in recent weeks, while Bitcoin has remained relatively stagnant. However, the increasing correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P500 suggests that Bitcoin might soon follow the upward trend we’ve seen in traditional equities.

Figure 4: S&P500 has recently outperformed BTC, and given the strong correlation between S&P500 & Bitcoin there’s a chance we’ve got some catching up to do. View Live Chart 🔍

ConclusionIn summary, while Bitcoin has been slow to react to the recent decline in the DXY, the broader market conditions suggest a potential for a bullish phase in our current cycle. We’ve seen a shift in sentiment amongst traditional market investors and, subsequently, a period of outperformance for the S&P500.Whether the market is overestimating the impact of the dollar's decline remains to be seen, but the potential for a rally is there.For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out a recent YouTube video here: The US Dollar Decline Will Be the BTC Bull Market Catalyst"
Bitcoin Magazine,"Politicians, Founders Motivate Crypto Voters on Day One of the America Loves Crypto Tour","Thu, 05 Sep 2024 18:15:02 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/politicians-founders-motivate-crypto-voters-on-day-one-of-the-america-loves-crypto-tour,Prominent politicians and crypto industry leaders from Arizona encourage pro-crypto voters to head to the polls in November on the first stop of a five-date swing state tour.,"On a 100°F evening in Phoenix, crypto enthusiasts from Arizona came out with gusto for the first night of the America Loves Crypto tour.The tour, organized by the Stand With Crypto Alliance, a non-profit on a mission to get America’s 52 million crypto owners out to the polls in November, will roll through five swing states in the coming weeks, bringing awareness to the importance of voting for candidates who support pro-crypto policies in the upcoming US elections.On this evening in Arizona, politicians such as Senator Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) and Arizona House Speaker Pro Tempore Travis Grantham (R) spoke to the audience alongside crypto industry founders before making way for the psychedelic soul grooves of the Black Pumas.The Mission and the Margin“A huge priority for us is turning out the crypto vote,” Logan Dobson, Executive Director of Stand With Crypto, told Bitcoin Magazine.“Our only cause is crypto. We’re not pushing for specific candidates. We’re not pushing for specific parties. We’re just getting the crypto vote out,” he added.“And I can tell you that in multiple swing states already, there are more people who have signed up with Stand With Crypto than the margin of victory was in 2020.”Dobson’s final point is particularly pronounced in Arizona, where, in the 2020 presidential election, President Biden beat former President Trump by about 10,500 votes. Stand With Crypto has signed up almost three times the amount of crypto advocates — 27,231 — than the amount of voters who accounted for Biden’s margin of victory in the previous election.Encouragement from PoliticiansSenator Sinema kicked off the event, urging audience members to fearlessly vote for candidates who support pro-crypto policies.“You guys are a real force in Arizona and it’s important that we use this election cycle to ensure that the crypto community’s voice is heard,” said Senator Sinema.“We’ve got to push for policies that fuel innovation so the financial system works for everyday people. We’ve got to make sure that candidates up and down the ballot — state legislatures as well as at the federal level — understand crypto and are working towards a great political climate for crypto rather than one that’s based on misinformation, fear and old-school regulations that hinder the industry,” she added.Sinema concluded her brief speech with what seemed like a mild jab at the Democrats, the party she parted ways with in December 2022.“Don’t be afraid to support a candidate or an elected official who takes risks,” she said.“You all understand the value of taking risks. The crypto industry wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for risk taking,” Sinema added.“We want to look for candidates who are reasonable but are willing to take risks and speak out against the party line rhetoric that’s trying to stop or slow the innovation of this industry.”Following Sinema was Grantham, a proponent of the freedom with which bitcoin and crypto provides its users.Grantham didn’t mince words from the stage. He discussed how politicians are abusing the US dollar by spending more of it than they have and printing it at will. He made the case that it’s up to Gen Z and Millennials especially to vote for pro-crypto politicians to allow for assets like bitcoin to compete against the dollar. He was even more explicit on this topic in an interview backstage with Bitcoin Magazine.“There’s a large group of elected officials who think the government is the solution to our monetary problems, that this fiscal irresponsibility doesn’t matter and that the dollar is going to be the end-all-be-all forever — and that’s just a crazy way of thinking,” Grantham told Bitcoin Magazine.“One of the reasons [crypto] is becoming so popular is because of what we’re doing to the dollar,” he argued.

Arizona House Speaker Pro Tempore Travis Grantham (R) addresses the crowd.

For this reason, Grantham felt it’s essential for voters to support candidates who don’t believe in regulating crypto out of existence, and to vote for politicians who support freedom as opposed to those who seek control.“It’s a freedom and control issue,” said Grantham.“[Some politicians want] control by keeping everybody married to one currency and not allowing anything else to break through, which crypto is doing. Competition is a good thing, especially when the person who controls the only thing is abusing it so badly,” he concluded.Founders Aren’t Asking For MuchNext, a panel of crypto founders based in Arizona took the stage. The panel featured Thor Abbasi, co-founder of DeFi protocol Zivoe; George Mekhail, VP of Operations for Bitcoin Magazine and co-organizer of the Arizona Bitcoin Network; and Shelton Beascochea, co-founder of DevilsDAO and Stand With Crypto Arizona Chapter President.The industry leaders asked for little more than clear rules of the road from the US government, so that they could operate their businesses on-shore and compliantly. In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Abbasi discussed the anxiety that crypto founders have faced due to unfair treatment by federal regulatory agencies under the Biden administration.“One of the toughest things for our project is [knowing] how the industry can interact with banks,” Abbasi told Bitcoin Magazine.“We've all probably heard about Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” he added, referring to the government’s unconstitutional crackdown on the politically unfavorable, but not illegal crypto industry, which resulted in the debanking of many crypto companies.“If we had regulation describing what crypto companies need to do in order to be banked, that would be hugely beneficial.”

George Mekhail addresses the crowd as part of a crypto founders panel.

Mekhail ended the spoken portion of the night’s programming on a high note, highlighting that the crypto industry has made notable progress, which will likely only gain steam moving forward.“Think about where we were four years ago,” said Mekhail.“We couldn’t have an event like this. The fact that 15% of Americans own some form of crypto is crazy, especially thinking about what it’s going to be four years from now,” he added.“The momentum is behind us. It’s events like this and just showing up and demonstrating that we have a voice that is really important.”The second date of the America Loves Crypto tour is scheduled for this evening, September 5, at The Space in Las Vegas, NV. You can RSVP to the event here."
Bitcoin Magazine,Venezuelan Opposition Leader María Corina Machado Calls Bitcoin a “Lifeline” in Exclusive Interview,"Thu, 05 Sep 2024 16:26:22 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/venezuelan-opposition-leader-maria-corina-machado-calls-bitcoin-a-lifeline-in-exclusive-interview,"María Corina Machado, Venezuelan opposition leader, discusses Bitcoin as a ""vital means of resistance"" for Venezuelans suffering from hyperinflation under the Chávez and Maduro regimes.","In an exclusive interview with Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer of the Human Rights Foundation (HRF), Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado discussed Bitcoin’s vital role in combating Venezuela’s economic collapse and authoritarianism. The interview, first published on Bitcoin Magazine, highlights the catastrophic impact of hyperinflation caused by the Chávez and Maduro regimes, which have devastated the Venezuelan bolívar.Machado noted that under Chávez and Maduro, the bolívar has lost 14 zeros, with inflation skyrocketing to 1.7 million percent in 2018. She described the economic destruction, stating, “This financial repression rooted in state-sponsored looting, theft, and unchecked money printing” crippled the economy despite Venezuela's vast oil wealth.During the interview, Gladstein emphasized how some Venezuelans turned to Bitcoin as a way to escape hyperinflation, protect their wealth, and fund their escape from the country. Machado echoed this, calling Bitcoin a ""lifeline"" for Venezuelans, a way to bypass government-controlled exchange rates. She proposed including Bitcoin in Venezuela’s future national reserves as the country seeks to recover its stolen wealth and rebuild from the dictatorship.“Bitcoin bypasses government-imposed exchange rates and helps many of our people... It has evolved from a humanitarian tool to a vital means of resistance,” Machado stated.Machado also spoke of the Venezuelan people’s determination to reclaim democracy, noting their historic efforts in confronting the regime. She hailed the use of technology like Bitcoin to ensure financial autonomy and help rebuild a new, free Venezuela.Looking to the future, she envisions Bitcoin playing a key role in ensuring transparency, property rights, and economic freedom as part of Venezuela’s recovery plan, stating, “We envision Bitcoin as part of our national reserves, helping rebuild what the dictatorship stole.”Those interested in supporting the Venezuelan opposition party's efforts for a peaceful transition and the recognition of their victory can do so via the HRF here."
Bitcoin Magazine,Advancing Bitcoin Security: The Journey from Basic Wallets to Advanced Protocols,"Thu, 05 Sep 2024 16:17:57 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/advancing-bitcoin-security-the-journey-from-basic-wallets-to-advanced-protocols,A look at the history of the evolution of Bitcoin wallets.,"Security strategies within the Bitcoin network are in a constant state of progression, and in this exploration, we will assess how these strategies have evolved from simple digital wallets to complex multi-signature mechanisms. This includes an overview of the latest advancements in cryptographic technologies, such as Schnorr signatures. In simple terms, we will examine these technologies that help to provide the necessary fortifications that act as the foundation behind Bitcoin’s security framework. We will also consider some of the major security incidents in recent years and the lessons that were learned. The overall aim of this piece is to emphasize the importance of the Bitcoin community in developing new ways to secure Bitcoin infrastructure and strengthen blockchain technology - this need is further emphasized by the impending threat of quantum computing … How Has Bitcoin Security Has Evolved Over The YearsSince Bitcoin’s launch in 2009, the world of finance and technology has been completely transformed, moving toward ultimate financial freedom as an ambitious yet noble goal. As a decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has surged in value and become the 13th major currency in the world. However, this value has also presented a range of security challenges. To think that, just a decade and a half ago, the most we could do with Bitcoin was to buy a pizza, it’s not hard to see how we ended up with today’s wallet standards. Bitcoin initially relied on rather basic security solutions such as digital wallets that stored cryptographic keys to facilitate transactions. These wallets, although effective in basic terms, lacked the necessary security to prevent malware threats and cybersecurity threats which quickly became more sophisticated as the years passed - requiring innovations to keep Bitcoin safe. Software WalletsEarly digital wallets were basic software that sat on a person’s hard drive, storing private, cryptographic keys that allowed users to access and transfer their Bitcoin. As Bitcoin’s value grew and cybercriminals became aware of its potential, the need for better security became paramount to prevent widespread hacking and theft. Initially, digital wallets were improved with better encryption and dedicated user interfaces but this did little to stem the tide of a growing number of cyber threats. Improving and maintaining software wallets became a somewhat futile task for developers who were forced to constantly run API penetration tests, stress tests, and various other security exercises to ensure a high level of security. As a result, a new, more practical solution was created. Hardware WalletsThese hardware devices stored private keys offline and negated a lot of the threats that were linked to software wallets that were connected to the internet. Hardware wallets came in the form of a small device that connected to a computer via USB — two popular hardware examples were Ledger and Trezor. Although hardware wallets were offline and required a pin code to access, and if lost, recovering these pin codes was a multi-faceted process. This higher level of security led to these devices growing in popularity as they were not susceptible to malware attacks, private keys never left the device, and transactions were completed within the wallet before being confirmed on the blockchain.Multi-signature WalletsThese advanced wallets required multiple signatures or approvals from multiple users before any transactions could be executed. This drastically reduced the chance of any unauthorized access and this method was favored by businesses and organizations who regularly made large-scale Bitcoin transactions. To make a transaction, two or more private keys are required to authorize the activity, similar to written contracts that require multiple signatures. This way, even if one private key has been hacked, the Bitcoin within the wallet still cannot be accessed. Advancements/ Taproot and Schnorr SignaturesTaproot was a significant upgrade to the Bitcoin network that was designed to improve scalability and brought about a series of enhancements. One such enhancement was Schnorr signatures which offered multiple benefits over the previous Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) mechanism which facilitated the generation and verification of private keys. The key benefits of Schnorr signatures were that they allowed for smaller signature sizes, offered quicker verification times, and provided better protection against certain cyberattacks. Key aggregation was the most significant enhancement of Schnorr signatures which reduced the size of multi-sig private keys so they take up less space in a block and incur the same transaction fees as a single-party transaction. Another important upgrade was the non-malleability feature that prevents cybercriminals from modifying a valid signature to allow them to commit malicious activity. Schnorr signatures also improve the privacy of multi-sig wallets, increasing their complexity significantly when compared to single signatures. Preparing For Future Threats To BitcoinThe rise of quantum computing poses a significant threat to Bitcoin, as these machines can solve extremely complex problems that standard computers cannot. This can include deciphering cryptographic keys. Should this technology become more accessible and fall into the hands of cybercriminals, the risk of unauthorized access to all types of wallets becomes significant and could lead to the complete collapse of the cryptocurrency market if there is no solution. The Bitcoin community has been busy conducting ongoing research to assist in the development of quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. The hope is that the development of these advanced algorithms will provide sufficient protection against this impressive computational power but the key challenge is the successful implementation of them into the Bitcoin network. This process will be extremely complex, requiring a precise orchestration of all users, from developers to miners. Creating algorithms that even a quantum computer cannot crack is a monumental task and is described as post-quantum cryptography. Although the development of these cutting-edge algorithms is still in its early stages, more and more developers are lending their hand to the cause and things are expected to accelerate in the next few years. High-Profile Bitcoin Security IncidentsLet’s consider two recent Bitcoin security incidents that have caused major disruption and helped to change the way we think about securing cryptocurrency. Ronin Network breach - In March 2022, the highest-value cryptocurrency attack was the breach of the Ronin Network which powered the extremely popular Axie Infinity blockchain gaming platform. By breaching this network, cybercriminals stole around $625m worth of cryptocurrency. North Korean state-backed hackers, Lazarus Group are thought to be the culprits and It is believed they obtained five of the nine private keys held by transaction validators that were required to access Ronin Network's cross-chain bridge (a decentralized application that facilitates transactions). Binance Exchange hack - Back in October 2022, one of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance was hacked, with $570m stolen. Hackers targeted the BSC Token Hub, a cross-chain bridge, and exploited a bug in a smart contract to extract Binance coins. As well as high-profile cases such as this, the countless number of individuals that cybercriminals have targeted is an even bigger concern. Some people can become complacent when it comes to securing their Bitcoin keys, while various platforms can employ outdated processes or need to provide more security. For example, If a wallet, platform, or application has a QR code for registration, this can be a significant security flaw, especially given that hackers have already targeted features like this. Conclusion - What Have We Learned?These high-level cybercrime cases show that even the most advanced and high-profile cryptocurrency institutions struggle to keep up with the latest cybercrime techniques. In addition to vast and complex blockchain networks and secondary-level, third-party applications, the resources needed to secure Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are substantial. Although multi-sig wallets provide impressive protection, they are not ironclad. This is why developing advanced algorithms, such as those created to fend off quantum computing attacks is the key focus to ensure the future of cryptocurrency. This is a guest post by Kiara Taylor.

Users avoid selling Bitcoin and crypto on an exchange before spending, maintaining full ownership. However, Mastercard's card does have fees, including a €1.6 issuance fee, €1 monthly maintenance fee, and a 0.95% transaction fee. Nonetheless, by supporting non-custodial wallets, Mastercard addresses a major pain point and grants users the flexibility to directly control their Bitcoin and crypto. The move caters to a growing audience preferring self-hosted wallets over centralized exchanges."
Bitcoin Magazine,Blockstream Opens New Funding Round For Its Second Bitcoin Mining Security Token,"Thu, 05 Sep 2024 10:00:00 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blockstream-opens-new-funding-round-for-its-second-bitcoin-mining-security-token,Blockstream’s second Mining Note — the BMN2 — is designed much like the successful BMN1.,"Today, Blockstream opens the series 3 round for its second Mining Note — the BMN2.The note will be available to eligible non-US investors and has been repriced from the series 1 and 2 rounds, which occurred on July 18. This round of the BMN2 is priced at $31,000 petahash per second (PH/s), or a hash price of $21.23. Investors who purchased the BMN2 in the series 1 and 2 rounds, during which the note sold at a higher price, will be awarded extra BMN2 to make up for the difference in price between the first two rounds and the third.The issuance of the BMN2 comes on the heels of the success of the first Blockstream Mining Note, the BMN1, which provided a 32% return over BTC.Details of the BMN2The BMN2 will be a hashrate-backed security token offering (STO) issued on Blockstream’s Liquid Network by Luxembourg-based virtual asset service provider (VASP) Stokr. The note offers 1 PH/s at Blockstream’s North American mining operations for four years.“Hashrate contracts are typically 30 days up to six months,” James Macedonio, Senior Vice President of Global Sales at Blockstream, told Bitcoin Magazine, highlighting how the duration of Blockstream’s note differs from other financial products like it. “Rarely do you see [contracts] even go to 12 months.”Blockstream is offering the note in 1 PH/s increments because petahash has become the industry standard for measuring hash price, and the contract’s duration corresponds with the four-year Bitcoin halving cycle.“We wanted to lock in a hash price for customers for four years, which will basically run until the next halving,” he said.The minimum investment for professional investors is $10,000, while non-professional investors have a $115,000 minimum investment threshold. Shares of the STO will be fungible and will be available for trading, in both full and fractionalized form, on secondary markets including Bitfinex, SideSwap and Merj Exchange. Macedonio explained that Blockstream’s pricing is competitive, as the note will sell for a 50% discount to the current spot hash price.“If you're looking to buy hashrate, this is going to be a lot cheaper than buying a hashrate contract on the open market,” he said.The Success Of BMN1The BMN1, which offered 2 PH/s over a 36-month term, mined 1,242 bitcoin, delivering up to 103% cash-on-cash returns and the aforementioned 32% return over BTC. Blockstream is aiming to provide similar returns to investors with the BMN2.“We priced the BMN2 to a level at which we feel investors will get the same type of return,” said Macedonio.“We sold BMN1 at about a 60% discount to what would have been the hash price at the time. With the BMN2, we're selling at about a 50% discount to the current spot hash price. Future series pricing will be dependent on what the hash price is at that time,” he added.Blockstream will reward investors who roll over from BMN1 to BMN2 with a 3% bonus in additional BMN2 securities.BMNs Stand Apart From Similar ProductsBlockstream Mining Notes offer investors looking to gain exposure to bitcoin mining a unique value proposition.“We get really cheap energy rates and we get good pricing on equipment, as well,” said Macedonio. “So, we can offer a hashrate at a really cheap price compared to other folks.”Macedonio highlighted that the BMN2 is priced at the equivalent to hosting mining equipment at 4.5 cents per Kilowatt hour (kWh), whereas large customers currently pay upwards of 6.5 cents/kWh for hosting arrangements.He also noted that, with BMNs, investors don’t have to buy machines, nor do they have to worry about machine failures or power curtailment. Plus, investors don’t experience a lag in putting the money down for their investment and machines going online when they purchase BMNs.“I don’t think there’s another product out there that competes with it,” said Macedonio."
Bitcoin Magazine,Coinbase CFO Says Kamala Harris Campaign Accepts Crypto Donations: Fortune,"Wed, 04 Sep 2024 20:23:06 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/coinbase-cfo-says-kamala-harris-campaign-accepts-crypto-donations-fortune,Fortune reports that Coinbase CFO said Kamala Harris is using Coinbase Commerce to accept cryptocurrency donations for her presidential campaign.,"According to Fortune, Coinbase’s Chief Financial Officer, Alesia Haas, said that U.S. Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is using the company’s Commerce platform to accept cryptocurrency donations for her campaign. The statement was made during a conversation with Citigroup’s Director of Payments, Peter Christiansen, at the Citi 2024 Global TMT Conference in New York, in which Fortune reviewed a recording of the conversation.JUST IN: Coinbase CFO says Kamala Harris campaign is using Coinbase to accept crypto donations — Fortune 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/EWhSFY205R— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 4, 2024

“She is accepting crypto donations,” reportedly said Haas. “She’s using Coinbase Commerce now to accept crypto for her own campaign.”However, pro-Harris advocacy group Crypto4Harris said that they were unaware of this move. Additionally, Harris's official fundraising site does not yet display crypto donation options. So far, Harris’s campaign and Coinbase were reached out to for comment, but Fortune has not heard back yet at the time of writing.The ""Crypto for Harris"" initiative, launched last month, aims to garner support from crypto enthusiasts as Harris seeks to strengthen her presidential bid. “She has a huge opportunity, we’re cautiously optimistic,” Haas reportedly continued. “She has not rolled out the details yet, but she has made overtures that she would like to drive crypto legislation.”Harris’ decision to accept cryptocurrency donations marks a strategic move to rival her opponent Donald Trump, who earlier this year embraced Bitcoin Lightning Network donations for his campaign. Trump's alignment with the Bitcoin community was further solidified when he spoke at The Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville—an event Harris notably declined to attend."
Bitcoin Magazine,Choose Privacy,"Wed, 04 Sep 2024 20:11:07 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/choose-privacy,"Technological capability, on its own, is not enough to create Bitcoin privacy. Unless users and society actively defend and demand privacy, it will die. From ""The Privacy Issue"".","This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine's ""The Privacy Issue"". Subscribe to receive your copy.Privacy is a fundamental issue in using a public blockchain system like Bitcoin. Numerous projects and proposals have been made over the years to either build privacy preserving tools on top of Bitcoin, or fundamentally add privacy at the protocol layer itself. Satoshi himself discussed briefly the idea of zero knowledge proofs being a mechanism to enable greater privacy before he left. This is all the original whitepaper had to say on the topic of privacy:10. PrivacyThe traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the ""tape"", is made public, but without telling who the parties were. 


As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.—----------------That’s it. That is the only consideration Satoshi gave in releasing Bitcoin to the transactional privacy of its users. Don’t reuse addresses, and carefully think through when you spend a coin together with another one because it will create transparent ownership links on the blockchain. Fifteen years later we have a comprehensive enough body of knowledge and experience to know that this section in the whitepaper is woefully incomplete. It was nothing more than an abstract description of the model within which private, or non-private, use of Bitcoin would evolve over the coming decade. His advice to avoid spending coins together is no more practical than someone advising you to never spend more than a single cash note when buying something for the rest of time. It was inevitable that in the course of using Bitcoin as a currency people would regularly have to spend multiple coins together, inextricably linking their funds together over the time in the course of successive transactions. Basic heuristics such as spending coins together form the basis of blockchain analysis, and the unraveling of people’s transaction history. If multiple coins are spent together in a single transaction, it's a good assumption that all of those coins are owned by the same person. If an address is used to receive multiple coins from different people, those are all owned by the same person. When large groups of coins get spent together and connected over time, this forms a cluster. All of these, and other, basic heuristics are why Bitcoin’s blockchain are not private. You can watch transactions on-chain and apply these heuristics to them. Now before I go any further, that was a critical point to make early on to ensure people could reason about it correctly, but it prescribed no reasonable or useful models for how to proactively maintain your privacy as a user. This is one of Bitcoin’s fundamental shortcomings. The protocol itself does not provide any tool or architecture to inherently protect the privacy of its users, that is left entirely up to them. Choosing PrivacyMany protocols have been designed over the years to try to address this problem:Coinjoins: Protocols where users collaborate to spend their coins together, allowing them to send the same amount of coins to each of their addresses in the same transaction, confusing observers as to who’s coins went where. Coinswap: Protocols where users can privately perform a swap involving two transactions where they exchange their coins with each other. As long as both parties cooperate with each other, no connection is visible on the blockchain between the two transactions. Chaumian Ecash Mints: Protocols allowing a centralized issue to mint cryptographically blinded tokens structured in a way that they cannot tell which token is which when a user goes to redeem them. It facilitates centralized yet highly private transactions. Confidential Transactions: One of the components that is critical to Monero, it was originally developed by a developer working on Bitcoin. It obscures the amounts cryptographically blinding them, and providing a proof that the outputs to a transaction are equal to or less than the inputs without showing them. It was highly inefficient at the time it was proposed, and would have exacerbated Bitcoin’s scaling issues. It also allows a quantum attacker to secretly inflate the Bitcoin supply without being detected, or unravel everyone’s transaction history, if they can break the cryptographic assumptions Bitcoin depends on, depending on which types of cryptographic commitments it uses. Zerocoin: A scheme created to allow depositing coins into a single “escrow pool”, withdrawing later with no connected on-chain history to before verified by a zero knowledge proof. It was never implemented because the scheme was very computationally intensive to use at the time.The first two of these proposals are application layer proposals, they are things that can be built on top of Bitcoin right now. No changes are necessary, and anyone can build software and tools allowing users to utilize either protocol. The second two are fundamental upgrades to Bitcoin at a protocol level. They cannot just be done now, and require convincing people to upgrade Bitcoin in a way that comes with non-negligible trade offs. In my opinion those upgrades will most likely never happen. That leaves us with things we can build now. Many tools have already been built, and many more will have to be built, but our path forward is paved with privacy tools that people have to choose to use. If no one makes use of them, they are useless. No one can achieve privacy alone in a public system like Bitcoin, you need other people in order to achieve privacy on a blockchain, you need a crowd to hide in. This is very much an individual choice, yet at the same time each individual’s choice has a profound impact on the whole of everyone using Bitcoin. It is one of the most important choices there is to make regarding Bitcoin. If people do not value their privacy enough to act to preserve it, then privacy on Bitcoin will die. It will become verboten, something ostracized at first, then actively penalized and punished as time goes on. Governments will stigmatize it, regulate it away, and relegate it to an obscure minority on the fringes of society. At that point, privacy on Bitcoin will have failed. Even Eric Hughes, the author of the Cypherpunk Manifesto, coiner of the phrase “cypherpunks write code,” realized later on that code alone was not enough: “Perhaps the single most important lesson I've learned from cypherpunks is that code alone doesn't cut it. Not code alone, not code widely distributed, not even code widely used. Some measure of toleration in society for activities conducted in private is necessary for long term success. Not convenient, not easier, but necessary.” -Eric Hughes, Cypherpunk Mailing List Mar 14, 1996. People must choose to value privacy at large. It must be a valuable thing to them, valuable enough that they will act even in the face of coercion and intimidation to achieve it. It must be widely tolerated in society, the same way that free speech is in America, or the right to bear arms. It must be something so widely supported that even in the face of fierce opposition from some segment of society, governments will not act to outright stifle it in the face of the size of its support. People must disobey such attempts in such large numbers that it is socially and practically intractable to actually enforce them. This decision, and the actions that follow it, is very much a political decision. A political act. People must act, or this battle is already lost. Building PrivacyWe are going to assume for now that people will act, and in sufficient numbers to be successful. So what exactly do they do? Without fundamental changes to the protocol people have to opt into specific tools in order to preserve their privacy. What tools? How do they work? We went over a handful of tools above, but we did not really go into a deeper or holistic view of how they work. It’s important to understand how different tools can interact with each other. Seen in a vacuum, it's easy to walk away thinking that any individual privacy tool on Bitcoin can never be good enough on a technological level, but when you start to look at all of them interacting together it should be apparent that a very strong degree of privacy can be achieved. If users adopt all of these tools together. Almost everything in Bitcoin is composable, none of the tools people have at their fingertips exist in a vacuum. Different things can be used in synergistic ways, whether that takes the form of being combined outright into single tools or multiple tools being used in tandem. Let’s go through the current state of things from top (upper layers) to bottom (the base layer). Chaumian EcashChaumian ecash mints are an old idea predating Bitcoin by decades. David Chaum came up with the concept in 1982. Chaumian ecash utilizes blind signatures to create a private payment mechanism. In the scheme, a central mint server acts as a token issuer, facilitating the creation of new tokens backed by deposits and redeeming tokens for new ones to process transactions. The private nature of the transactions it processes are powered by blind signatures. Each token is essentially just a random value signed by the mint. In the naive case of such a scheme, the mint would be able to track the redemption of each token it signed, correlating the one being redeemed with the one being issued and viewing each token chain's transactional history. By blinding each token value before submitting to the mint for signing, the mint is unaware of the exact value it signed. After acquiring the mint’s signature, they can unblind it, resulting in a perfectly valid signature from the mint on the plaintext of the token value the user generated. The mint would only see a plaintext token whenever it was redeemed to be issued a new one, and because the token was blinded when it signed it, it would have no idea when or for who it signed. This allows for centralized, but incredibly private, transactions. The mint will have no idea who is paying who when it redeems tokens for new ones. For the cost of trusting the operator to custody funds, users can realize a level of almost perfect privacy. It also has no requirements for receiving liquidity or other shortcomings protocols like Lightning suffer from. Any user anywhere willing to trust a mint can receive money privately simply by receiving a token from another user and redeeming it for a new one from the mint. The utility of ecash goes far beyond just private scalable payments as well, ecash tokens can be made programmable. When someone uses a Chaumian mint, they are trusting the operator to process payments honestly and not steal everyone’s money. There is no reason at that point why they can’t also do more than process payments. They can also enforce smart contracts. The same way that Bitcoin script allows people to program conditions on when their bitcoin can be spent, mints could use script or other programming languages to allow users to program conditional spending requirements into ecash tokens. Rather than just generating a random value to blind for the mint to sign, users could generate a script program to blind. After the mint signs it, when someone comes to redeem that token they will see the script it is programmed with. The mint simply refuses to authorize a redemption unless the script is fulfilled. There are a few different trust models possible now, with more surely to come as people think more about how they can be built. The simplest and most straightforward is a single operator. This is the same as any custodial system like Coinbase. The next is a federated operator, distributing the trust across multiple parties. This puts ecash on par with many other systems built in this space people consider decentralized. There are even suggested models that invert the entire risk relationship, where the chaumian mint issues tokens backed by its own money, lending them out to users and periodically calling in the debt. So, even right now, we can achieve an enormous amount of privacy…but at the cost of a loss of sovereignty and control over our own funds. This is far, far from ideal, but it’s a path forward that is open to us now. We just need there to be enough people operating these, and a solution for people using different mints to interact with them. Enter the Lightning Network. It allows seamless deposits and withdrawals by users interacting with a mint, and a quick settlement mechanism for a receiving user to cash in a mint from one token and transfer it to another mint they prefer using or trust more.Lightning NetworkLightning is a network of bi-directional payment channels, allowing users to route payments off-chain across this network. Users collaborate with one another to lock funds in a two party multisig address, using pre-signed transactions to ensure each party can claim their funds back without any help if necessary. After being established, the balance of funds can be updated off-chain by signing a new set of transactions and exchanging “penalty keys” that would allow the other party to confiscate the entirety of a cheating user’s funds in the channel if they attempted to use any old transactions on-chain. Lightning, while far from perfect, is a massive improvement in terms of privacy compared to on-chain bitcoin use purely by virtue of not recording every transaction that occurs on the blockchain. Rather than every transaction a user makes permanently recording the history of where coins came from and where they went, the only visible history on the blockchain is the creation of the payment channel. Nothing about payments made or received is visible to the general public, only the counterparty the channel was opened with. As far as the off-chain footprint is concerned, things are a bit more nuanced. Receivers for instance currently reveal their Lightning node to anyone paying them. This could be addressed with BOLT 12, a proposal incorporating a scheme called blinded paths which obscures the receiver’s Lightning node from the sender by having them compute the last few hops in the payment route. Senders however currently have excellent privacy, with the receiver learning nothing about their Lightning node or funds. Lightning has some rough edges for end users to deal with though. Namely the requirement to have liquidity allocated by their channel counterparty to receive money, and the inability to receive more money than their channel counterparties have available to route to them. It functions amazingly as a payment routing network, assuming users have addressed the liquidity issues. Most users address these by making use of a Lightning Service Provider (LSP). They fill the role of providing liquidity for users to receive money, but the trade off of solving that problem comes with privacy trade offs. The LSP is a large entity serving many users, and in the process learns about a large number of users’ payment activity. In some cases, particularly LSPs that make use of Trampoline Routing (a scheme where the LSP calculates a payment route for you), they even learn the destination of all their users’ payments. Some of these issues can be addressed by bolting Chaumian ecash mints on top of Lightning. By having many users “use” a single Lightning node operated by the mint, liquidity allocated so the mint can receive funds can be shared more efficiently by all users. The private nature of ecash also helps shield users from some of the privacy shortcomings of Lightning. Even if the mint, the Lightning node operator, knows where payments it makes across the network are going, it doesn’t know which user(s) made them. Overall use of Lightning directly by a user is not as private as Chaumian ecash, and does come with the added issues of having to source receiving liquidity and interact with LSPs, but it does not require relinquishing control of your funds. It can’t scale as well as ecash, and is more complicated to use, but it has a far superior trust model. One thing Lightning doesn’t do however, is completely obscure the ability to track coins moving on-chain. It might hide and obscure individual payments conducted off-chain, but it is still possible to track coins into a channel, and track where they go when that channel is closed. Coinjoins Coinjoins are a protocol that enables multiple users to collaborate together to craft a transaction structured in a way to make tracking their coins difficult or impossible. Heuristics like common input ownership and clustering are the basis of tracking people’s funds. Breaking these is how to protect your privacy. Coinjoins accomplish this by structuring the amounts going in and out of a transaction properly.Assume you have five people who want to obscure their transaction history, by combining their coins together in a single transaction and all creating outputs of the same denomination they create a false positive for common ownership by spending their coins together and create a false cluster. Because the outputs are of the same denomination, no one can be sure when they are spent in the future whose coins they actually are. Now consider a Lightning user again. Even if realizing the maximum privacy benefits possible with Lightning, they still need to consider the privacy implications of interacting with the blockchain. Imagine a user withdrew coins from a KYC exchange and opened a Lightning channel. He might be able to make thousands of transactions back and forth over Lightning, but when he closes that channel with less funds than he put into it, the exchange can see that he at least spent that much somewhere in his off-chain activity. When he spends those coins with other coins known to be his, or opens a new Lightning channel associated with his node with them, the exchange can be even more confident they are still under his control. These connections need to be broken and obfuscated. That is the role coinjoins can play. Coinjoin was the most widely deployed protocol for base layer privacy, the two largest examples being Wasabi by ZKSnacks and Whirlpool by Samourai. Samourai was recently shut down after the founders were arrested, and Wasabi voluntarily discontinued the operation of their coordinator shortly after. Both of these systems depended entirely on a centralized coordinator server to help users actually construct their coinjoin transactions. Joinmarket is another option that is operational currently, using a decentralized model where “takers” (users) select from a market of “makers” (liquidity providers) to coordinate coinjoins. Joinmarket however is not as well developed or maintained as there is no company behind it. It is a purely open source project. These are not the only options by any means. People can spin up a Wasabi or Whirlpool server again if they want, people can even design new coordination models for serverless coordination. The coinjoin transaction itself, and how it is coordinated, are very separate things despite being related. There are many different ways the goal of coordinating the creation of the coinjoin can be accomplished. And importantly, it is permissionless to try new ways. The Holistic StackNow that we’ve gone through these pieces, think about how they all interrelate. How they form together to create a holistic synergy at every layer to maximize privacy. Users transacting with an ecash mint have a massive degree of privacy even from the mint operators, those mint operators in using Lightning can themselves achieve substantial privacy for themselves and their users interacting with other mints, and in reorganizing liquidity on the base layer coinjoins can keep even that activity done on a public blockchain obscured. Even without radical changes to Bitcoin itself, there is a path forward from where we are now to a private and censorship resistant Bitcoin. It is not ideal, it does require either costs and complexity or compromising on the desired goal of trustlessness, but it is possible. Going forward, it can be made even better with each improvement made to the Bitcoin protocol. Covenant schemes that improve scalability could address some of the issues with systems like Lightning. This would allow more users to be able to interact with Bitcoin in a private way self-custodially, rather than having to delegate control of their funds to a chaumian mint. Some of these scaling improvements might even reduce the need for on-chain privacy schemes such as coinjoins. Having more people share custody of a single coin in a trustless manner would introduce natural ambiguity as to who is doing what when withdrawals are made from that coin. We have a path forward even now, and that path will get brighter with each improvement made to the Bitcoin protocol. People just have to choose to actually walk down it. A Future With Privacy, Or A Future WithoutPrivacy might seem to some like a thing not worth caring about, or not that important. “What do you have to hide anyway?” I think those people simply don’t appreciate the implications of having no privacy. Look around at the world today, look at how quick people are to ostracize and shame someone publicly for innocuous things. Holding the wrong opinion, saying the wrong thing, voting for the wrong politician. More and more the lack of privacy in regards to personal life is causing disastrous and traumatizing consequences for people. It is vitally important that people actually have control over what information about themselves is or is not made available to the public. This is not just a matter of criminals wanting to hide nefarious or horrific things, it is about everyday people being able to protect themselves from the whims of the mob. Going even further than that, people living under totalitarian or oppressive governments around the world have much more to lose than a job or social standing if they are not able to maintain privacy. They can literally lose their lives. Privacy can be the difference between physical safety and danger even for people living in a safe and free jurisdiction. Imagine if in the course of transacting with someone you revealed that you own a sizable amount of bitcoin, you have now in a very real sense opened yourself up to the possibility of physical danger. There are numerous documented cases of kidnappings, physical assault, even torture by criminals attempting to steal bitcoin from individuals who have revealed themselves to be wealthy. Even domestic violence is an example of a situation where privacy is of utmost importance. One of the biggest reasons people do not leave abusive relationships is the financial inability to. How can someone in that situation attempt to work their way towards financial independence to leave without privacy? Without the ability to save and earn money without their partner discovering it? Privacy is important. To come back to Bitcoin, one of the chief properties it is valued for is its censorship resistance. The ability to transact however and whenever you want, without permission, without someone else having the ability to stop you. Transactions have two parties though, a sender and a receiver. A buyer and a seller. If governments, regulators, the mob of the public, all can track your payments and coins in public, how can you have censorship resistance? How can that exist when any government or mob can coerce and threaten people to not transact with you? How can Bitcoin be censorship resistant when everything you do can be followed, and when you become persona non grata, the weight of government and social pressure can prevent others from interacting with you? Remove that choice from the individual of whether to transact with you or not, and impose a decision on them? When a merchant has to worry that if they receive “the wrong coins” the government will track them down and seize them, resulting in them losing money? It can’t.If coins can be distinguished from each other in any meaningful way, and tracked as they move around, Bitcoin starts breaking down and not even functioning properly as a money. Money has to be fungible, i.e. two coins must be indistinguishable from each other from a merchant’s point of view. To be fungible, it has to be private. Privacy, fungibility, and censorship resistance are all facets of the same thing. They can only exist together.People have to choose to value privacy, or Bitcoin will lose its censorship resistance. Most people won’t choose privacy over purely ideological grounds, or political grounds, they will need to be shown it is actually useful. They need to actually see and use something that lets them donate to a cause important to them without being shamed or attacked for it. They need to see that people in a totalitarian state can actually use it to accomplish something meaningful. They need to actually see the eerie and creepy omnipresent ads online disappear or become wildly inaccurate as they make purchases privately, out of sight of the big data fishing net. This is the most important battle Bitcoin will ever face, and we are at an inflection point in that fight right now. The outcome of this fight will shape Bitcoin for the rest of its existence. Will it be a tool for sovereignty and freedom, or one for surveillance and oppression? That is up to us to decide. I do not want to live in a world where I have no privacy of thought, of interaction, of transaction. Where every action I take, every thought I utter, or even think, is put under the scrutiny of the government and the mob of the public. Where the slightest misstep leads my life to ruin, with no room for dissent or dialogue or debate. I choose privacy. I choose censorship resistance. I choose freedom. "

Bitcoin Magazine,UTXO Research Report: State Of The Bridges,"Wed, 04 Sep 2024 14:08:22 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/state-of-the-bridges,A research report analyzing the different trust models and functioning mechanisms of proposed and existing two-way pegs for Bitcoin layers.,"As we enter a new era of development on Bitcoin, it has become very hard for most people to understand the nuances of the L2 debate, and ever harder to follow some of the technical jargon associated with it. Sidechains, rollups, sequencer, multisig, ZKP…. In this report, we’ll try to shed some light on those concepts by outlining the UTXO thesis for Bitcoin L2s and by answering the following questions: Does Bitcoin even need Bridges? What are the differences between sidechains (BOB, Botanix, etc..) and rollups designs (Alpen, Citrea)? What are the strategies employed to convince Bitcoiners to bridge their BTC? What are the different BitVM implementations and how do they revolutionize Bitcoin Bridges? Can rollups compete with existing L2 designs such as Lightning? Table of contents:Questioning the Necessity of BridgesThe Current State of Bitcoin BridgesUnderstanding the Friction Between Solving Technical Challenges and Growing a Sustainable User Base.The Future State of Bitcoin Bridges (BitVM and others)The Thesis for Bitcoin Rollups and Bridge InnovationKey Takeaways:Delivering on the promises of Bitcoin Season 2 will require a lot more funding and research toward bridge design, blockspace dynamics, and interoperability. Sidechains exist on a spectrum and the Bitcoin “L2” category is a victim of ambitious marketing despite harboring a great deal of innovative new bridge systems that provide a valuable alternative to rollups. Rollups are going to be more impactful on Bitcoin than they’ll ever be on Ethereum and have the potential to reach over $133 billion in TVL over the next five years. BitVM and ZKP research is at the forefront of Bitcoin innovation and will become the most important topic of this cycle. Investment in companies capable of solving the upcoming problems related to Bitcoin rollups is paramount, including MEV research, data availability, decentralized sequencing, attestation chains, and of course, UX. 


Questioning the Necessity of BridgesWhen we talk about scaling Bitcoin, the same questions inevitably arise to remind us of the scale of the challenge. Among them, the question of whether the Bitcoin base layer should scale was answered long ago during the Blocksize Wars: Bitcoin will have to scale in layers. Layers, however, are a heterogeneous bunch and many different mechanisms exist to build them. One of the oldest and simplest ways of bringing scale to Bitcoin is sidechains. But sidechains are not technically a true “layer” of Bitcoin since they often lack the unilateral exit component that makes them trustless for users, i.e., with the same trust assumptions as the base layer. That is why, for the many years that followed the introduction of SegWit, the Bitcoin community focused a lot of energy on building the Lightning Network (a true L2 that depends on Bitcoin security to provide users with unilateral exit options) instead of sidechains. In order for users to join a sidechain, they first have to execute what we call a “peg-in” transaction (or “peg-out” to exit) — basically sending their BTC to an address controlled by the operators of the sidechain. The mechanism securing this system is called a bridge. The reason why bridges are so tricky is that they often rely on a multisignature wallet holding all the sidechain’s funds, and in order to execute withdrawals, users have to trust that a majority within the multisig will cooperate to accept it. For example, a group of 20 companies would set up a bridge contract together, requiring at least 12 (could be less or more) companies to confirm a withdrawal transaction. For obvious reasons, this never was an optimized security model and created great incentives for companies (or individuals) to potentially collude and steal user funds. A few examples of interesting sidechain design emerged during that time, such as Liquid (federation of companies) and RSK (merged-mined sidechain), but they never truly succeeded at scale. Before we go any further, let’s add some definitions from the researchers that have spent the most amount of time thinking about this — Bitcoin Layers. Sidechain is an L1 that exists to add more functionality to BTC, the asset. L1s are sovereign in technical architecture but typically exist as subsets of the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. It’s common for sidechains to enshrine a BTC bridge into their consensus mechanisms or involve Bitcoin miners in consensus — through merge mining or fee sharing.Rollup is a modular blockchain that uses a parent blockchain for data availability. The blockchain stores its state root and enough transaction data to reconstruct the state of the blockchain from genesis in the parent blockchain. Rollups are L2s.Two-way pegs are systems that facilitate the minting and burning of BTC-backed tokens on a Bitcoin layer or alternative L1. These systems are also known as bridges.So, if bridge designs have existed for a long time and they haven’t generated a lot of traction, why do we need them now? While Lightining dominated the L2 space for a long time, 2023 saw the introduction of a new idea that would challenge that dominance: BitVM. In a nutshell BitVM can allow Bitcoin to be more programmable, which could lead to the introduction of new L2 designs such as rollups. These new designs all rely on an old friend on sidechains: the bridge mechanism that allows users to go from the base chain to the sidechain. However, the promise of BitVM relies on the idea that we could make bridges more decentralized than with traditional sidechains by introducing a challenge mechanism that could punish dishonest actors in a federation. Therefore, rollups on Bitcoin would not be completely trustless but trust-minimized. You would still need to rely on an honest actor (we’ll dive into the specifics later in this report) to exit the chain (rollup) but this is a trade-off that many users could get comfortable with, given the potential scaling and programmability benefits. BitVM (and Robin Linus) essentially revived the idea of Bitcoin bridges, and brought more legitimacy to them as a way to scale Bitcoin. Bridge design is now part of every scaling discussion, and several Bitcoin companies are now fully dedicated to researching innovative ways of improving them. Now that we’ve seen why Bridge has made a comeback as a legitimate way of scaling Bitcoin, one could still argue that rollups enabled by BitVM will suffer the same fate as previously mentioned Liquid or RSK — a very limited user base. While this could be true, the success of rollups on Ethereum indicates a very strong demand from users and a lot of appetite from investors. The screenshots below, taken from the leading ETH rollups analytics platform L2Beat, show that the top 10 rollups on ETH have managed to accumulate close to $40 billion in assets bridged. Arbitrum, Base (Coinbase), and Optimism together have over 71% market share. Furthermore, over the past year only, the amount of ETH locked in rollups went from $6.1 million to $13.1 million, a 114% increase.

In fact, rollups are going to be more impactful on Bitcoin than they’ll ever be on Ethereum. If we assume the same level of rollup utilization (10.4% for ETH) and take the size of both networks as of July 2024 — $383 billion for ETH vs $1.276 trillion for BTC — we could make the simple calculation that the total addressable market for Bitcoin rollups could be around $133 billion. While this number is impressive, one could even argue that Bitcoin will require even more scale than ETH as it is poised to become the settlement network for all economic applications, and therefore rollups would have the potential to become even larger still.


Seeing this potential, a ton of developer mindshare came back to Bitcoin and sparked a true renaissance for the space. Anticipating that Bitcoin users will be interested in bringing more utility (yield) to their holdings, sidechains came back in full force at the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024. Over 70 projects launched with the promise of decentralizing their bridge design once the technology was available, while others created innovative bridge designs. The no-bridge meta. Although not the focus of this research piece, it is important to mention that many projects in the L2 space are trying to scale Bitcoin without the need for complex bridge systems. These protocols will play an integral part in the race for scalability on Bitcoin as they provide a valuable alternative for users not willing to make certain trade-offs. Arch: The Arch Network employs an innovative approach to state management on Bitcoin’s layer 1, utilizing ordinals through a unique “state chaining” process. State changes are committed in a single transaction, reducing fees and ensuring atomic execution. Built to add programmability without necessarily sacrificing self-custody, Arch makes it possible for Bitcoin users to develop and interact with decentralized applications without taking on additional trust assumptions. Its novel architecture consists of a two-piece execution platform: The Arch zkVM and the Arch Decentralized Verifier Network.QED: QED solves the fundamental scaling problem of blockchains by using zk-PARTH, a novel state model which enables massively parallel transaction proving and block generation. This allows QED to scale to millions of transactions per second, while guaranteeing security via proof of math.RGB++: RGB++ protocol is not BitVM even though it can provide native Turing-complete capability on Bitcoin layer 1. It neither relies on any new OP codes nor does it require hard forks or soft forks but rather directly provides programmability on layer 1. It also is not an EVM or a rollup, and it does not need a bridge. The RGB++ protocol attaches additional data as an extra program logic to the original Bitcoin UTXO. A single Bitcoin UTXO is linked with an off-chain data cell (or what is termed a Turing-complete UTXO). By connecting every on-chain UTXO with off-chain data and extra execution logic, the off-chain UTXO is transferred — despite being constrained by the script on the UTXO — whenever the original UTXO is transferred or spent. This allows the transfer of additional bits or assets from one UTXO to another, executing the script and effectively forging an off-chain transaction with off-chain state transfer from one state to another.The Current State of Bitcoin Bridges Now that we’ve established that new bridge designs can be of revolutionary value for Bitcoin as a settlement network, let’s dive into the current landscape of Bitcoin bridges, their architectures, optimizations, and different variants. Let’s take a look at a few different L2/sidechain designs, and how teams are thinking about mitigating certain trade-offs associated with their bridging mechanism. 


In a nutshell, we can identify four different types of bridge designs: Traditional Bridges: Normal bridges as described above. Reinforced Bridges: Reinforced bridges are bridge designs that have an additional layer of security added in order to mitigate some aspects of the protocol that could be too centralized. In the case of BOB (Built on Bitcoin) for example, phase 2 of the roadmap is planning to remove trust in (centralized) sequencers with Bitcoin miners running full nodes of BOB and thereby verifying that the sequencer is producing valid blocks. This offsets trust in the sequencer and thereby provides Bitcoin security through mining to a rollup. This will be achieved using an alternative version of merge-mining called Optimine.

Optimized Bridges: Optimized bridges are bridge designs that innovate by distributing trust among the participants of the multisig. A great example of an optimized bridge design is Botanix. The bridge multisig is constantly distributed among different users; it can evolve and change between blocks. In the case of Botanix, the bridge is also reinforced with a proof-of-stake (POS) system that becomes complementary to the FROST-based architecture. Trust-Minimized Bridges: These bridges are currently being developed by rollup teams and will feature near trustless assumptions, with the possibility of users even outside of the multisig to participate in the protocol. 


Understanding the Friction Between Solving Technical Challenges and Growing a Sustainable User Base. 1. The birth of an L2: choosing the best go-to-market strategy. For Bitcoin builders in 2024, there are only two options that can make sense in the context of the Bitcoin L2 paradigm: Choosing to focus on the technical challenges of bridging architecture and rollup design to build a trust-minimized layer with complex zero-knowledge proofs and BitVM optimizations. This is the Technological approach. Choosing to focus on the fastest go-to-market strategy by making calculated trade-offs with bridging architectures and execution environment in the hope of decentralizing those once the technology is available. To differentiate from current competitors and protect themselves from future ones, companies have to bring additional incentives in the forms of points or tokens to acquire users. This is the Community Moat approach. With the Community Moat approach specifically, the trade-off is simple: sacrifice decentralization in the medium term in order to gain TVL and a solid user base in the short term. While this approach may be criticized by hardcore Bitcoiners, it reflects a business-first mindset that is often lacking to many projects that end up failing despite being technologically superior. Execution is EVERYTHING. Those different approaches are the reason why having an intellectual debate on Bitcoin L2s has been so difficult recently. People tend to conflate the goals of companies attempting to solve a Technological problem with companies attempting to solve a User Acquisition problem. These companies have fundamentally different go-to-market strategies and therefore will use fundamentally different methods to convince users that they are, indeed, the best Bitcoin L2 (or the first). 2. Sidechains vs rollups: being on the spectrum. That’s really what it comes down to. There’s going to be Bitcoin sidechains, Bitcoin rollups, and everything in between. Bitcoin L2s exist on a spectrum, where the extreme is dominated either by builders going for the Technological approach or the Community Moat approach. Let’s dive into the spectrum. 


As Janusz from Bitcoin Layers would say, “Not every Bitcoin layer is made equal” and most people in the space have a tendency to discard companies choosing to focus on the faster go-to-market sidechains approach while admiring the complex work done by BitVM/ZKP researchers. (Please refer to the definitions of sidechains and rollups at the beginning of this piece if you’re struggling to understand why their approach is different.)While we can understand that point of view from a Bitcoin Maximalist perspective, I think it is a fundamental mistake from a free market perspective. While the technology approach might be more intellectually pleasing, and the perspective of having a truly decentralized L2 exciting, actual users tend to have different priorities. 


While this spectrum can be a useful tool to understand the trade-offs that companies make, ultimately, users will decide on their own how to prioritize UX, cheap fees, fast settlement, and protocol security. When you look at the current state of the crypto market, it isn’t clear that the technology-first approach can compete with the memetic power of a protocol like Solana. How many people in the world know of Solana compared to how many people have even heard the word rollup? At UTXO, we believe that there is value to be captured by both rollups and sidechains, especially if sidechains can deliver on their promises to decentralize over time. While this hasn’t been the case with other chains historically, we believe that once the technology is reliable and available, Bitcoin users expect trust-minimized solutions to become a standard and not just a protocol preference. 3. Do you want to make money or do you want to be right? The incentive programs of new Bitcoin layers. Let’s dive into existing projects’ go-to-market strategies and understand the opportunity size for early users and liquidity providers. The strategies described below are not exclusive to each project but we chose to focus on the ones that are the most characteristic for them. A) Point system (BOB): The BOB point system has been by far the most successful iteration of this strategy in the Bitcoin sphere. BOB Fusion is the official points program of BOB, where users can harvest BOB Spice (points) based on their on-chain activity on the BOB mainnet. B) Ecosystem first (Botanix): Choosing not to release a token at launch for their sidechain, Botanix’s approach is one of the smartest we’ve seen so far. Botanix is choosing an Application first approach but letting project building on top of Botanix shine. By partnering with Botanix, ecosystem projects will be supported with TVL from day one, and speculators’ only way to get exposure to Botanix launch will be to invest in its ecosystem apps. As we know, having a real and sticky user base actually using the application is the only way for L2s to survive in the long run, and Botanix is taking a radical approach to ensure this. C) Research (Bitlayer): With one of the most technically advanced teams in the space, one of the key differentiation points for Bitlayer has been their research-first approach, a rarity outside of rollup-only projects. Since the early days of BitVM, the Bitlayer team has been active in furthering our collective understanding of the idea and has released a number of extensive research papers on the subject. Furthermore, the team is actively exploring new ways to improve current BitVM designs and will likely be considered one of the most innovative L2 teams in the space once their research comes to fruition. The Future State of Bitcoin Bridges (BitVM and others)When we look at bridge designs it becomes apparent that the most decentralized ones will be developed with variations of BitVM. Indeed, BitVM is not a monolithic entity that one can just refer to in order to be understood in the context of Bitcoin rollups. A few teams are working on competing (and synergistic) adaptations of the initial proposal by Robin Linus. The main differences to understand in these variations of BitVM come down to a few key parameters: Trust assumptions: What is the level of decentralization of the bridge when it comes to the ability of users to trustlessly exit the rollup? In the case of BitVM and optimistic rollups, who can challenge the state of the rollup? Assumptions range from anyone (best) to only a majority of actors in the multisig (worst). Challenge response: Once a challenge has been issued to the optimistic rollup, how much time and resources (number of transactions + size of transactions at a given fee rate) are necessary for “justice to be done”? Assumptions range from months with multiple on-chain interactions (worst) to hours with a single interaction (best). From the Snarknado whitepaper: “BitVM, is, however, not without overhead. Like optimistic rollup, the proof needs a withdrawal period to allow challengers to come in. Notice that a fully on-chain challenge-response can require tens of roundtrips between the prover (called Paul in BitVM) and the challenger (called Vicky), and since Bitcoin has a block time of 10 minutes, it can be quite a long time. It is also a little bit unsure what would happen if many challengers want to challenge at the same time and whether it would affect the latency and the finality.”Capital efficiency: What are the capital requirements for operators of the rollup? How much BTC do they have to ensure that all users can withdraw funds and make transactions without any constraints? There is no good metric to objectively measure this but we can imagine a combination of “cost of capital required to lock funds for X time” + “multiple of BTC deposited by users required to be locked by operators.” Assumptions range from “high cost of capital with high BTC multiple” (worst, i.e., the incentive of operating a rollup does not make sense) to “low cost of capital with a BTC multiple of 1” (rollups can outcompete Lightning and Ark). “an operator will initially cover user withdrawal requests out of pocket then aggregate the necessary proofs into a single submission to the network. If other operators suspect foul play, they can challenge the submission. Successful challenges result in the dishonest operator losing their initial bond and being removed from the network. If the operator’s submission is not challenged, they can then reclaim the equivalent amount they disbursed from users’ original deposits.”


Despite all this innovation at the bridge level, one cannot separate the bridge from its foundation, and in the case of rollups, the foundation has to come from a few key choices in the very design of the rollup itself. For all the security and trust-minimization of BitVM bridges, in order to make a fair comparison between sidechains and rollups, we have to compare them “dans leur ensembles” (in their whole outfits). One of the herculean choices that teams will have to grapple with is the one of data availability (DA): “The publishing of transaction data which is required to verify transactions, satisfy proving schemes, or otherwise progress the chain. Specifically, a node will verify data availability when it receives a new block that is getting added to the chain. The node will attempt to download all the transaction data for the new block to verify availability. If the node can download all the transaction data, then it successfully verified data availability, proving that the block data was actually published to the network.” There are only two ways of ensuring data availability: post it directly to Bitcoin or post it somewhere else. In the case of Bitcoin rollups, by definition, one would expect that DA would always be posted to Bitcoin. However, this is a costly choice to make that will have negative consequences for both user transaction costs and rollup teams’ ability to generate net margins. In response to this, some teams have chosen to trade very real gains in security for cheaper transactions and additional scalability. The DA dilemma: 


Once again, trading off security for user experience may be considered sinful by Bitcoiners, but we have seen that in the case of sidechains or certain ETH rollups, some users may prefer it. In that sense, the DA dilemma is not so much a technical challenge as it is a social one. Yes, posting DA on Bitcoin in the only way to be considered a true Bitcoin L2, but will that matter if the only rollups with users are the ones with no Bitcoin DA? Some more definitions before going further: Optimium: Optimium is an optimistic rollup that stores transaction data on-chain. This ensures availability and security, but increases costs and reduces scalability versus off-chain options. However, users need not trust third-party data providers.Validium: Validium is an optimistic rollup variant that stores transaction data off-chain. This enables high scalability and low costs, but risks potential data censorship or unavailability issues without on-chain backups. Users must trust data providers are honest and resilient.An interesting investment opportunity that arises from the situation is the development of a potential DA layer with a strong relationship to Bitcoin — the Celestia of Bitcoin. While we’re not there yet, exploring different ways of mitigating consensus failures for rollups is a big area of focus for UTXO, and has in part informed our decision to invest in CHAR by Jeremy Rubin (Bitcoin Core developer, BIP-119 author). CHAR is based on attestation chains where nodes commit to signing a single unconflicted sequence to organize transactions. By acting as a layer 2 for scale and functionality, CHAR will bring new security to BitVM with L1 bonds while incentivizing operators by distributing rewards.This new way of thinking about protocol security (consensus orchestration) will make the on-chain resolution of challenges on BitVM more efficient and incentive-aligned.While LN attempts to solve the scalability in a peer-to-peer fashion, resulting in liquidity problems, rollups take transaction execution off chain — but the current architectures make it costly to use Bitcoin as a DA layer. All systems will eventually leverage centralized solutions to improve user experience, and at this point it’s difficult to tell which trade-off is worse.Looking ahead, Citrea plans to introduce volition, a hybrid model balancing on-chain security with off-chain cost efficiency. This allows applications to choose their data storage method based on their specific needs. This is something we haven’t seen before and that would deserve more attention when it comes to the DA dilemma for Bitcoin rollups. “So depending on your usage, if you want to deploy now a gaming application, you can use off-chain data. It is very cheap, very fast, but still gets this Bitcoin interoperability. If you want to build a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin application, you can use on-chain data so your stablecoin is fully on-chain secured, fully Bitcoin secured. A bit expensive but you still get this interoperability between the gaming application and the stablecoin application.”Other challenges with Bitcoin as a DA layer. The best way to learn about this is to read the latest Galaxy Research report on Bitcoin as a DA layer. However, one of the specific challenges where we would like to spend more time is the issue of blockspace demand and fee rate dynamics.Blockspace scarcity will/could lead to centralizing forces for rollups and ultimately for pools as well. Because of the large amount of data required to settle rollup activity on Bitcoin, rollup operators may be tempted to optimize their transaction flow by using the services of pools, such as Marathon, with slipstream. These kinds of OOB (out-of-bands) agreements with miners are a centralizing force as they provide additional revenue streams to pools that are not accessible transparently on-chain. On the other hand, it is perfectly normal in a free market for competing actors to find differentiation points and does not represent a fundamental threat to Bitcoin by altering the game theory of mining (i.e., only the most cost-effective miners survive in the long term). Fee rate dynamics will once again change with the introduction of another blockspace buyer of last resort, but this time will be different. Constant demand for blockspace no matter the fee rate, is not something that Bitcoin has witnessed in its recent history. In the case of ordinals, degens minting jpegs have an incentive to always make transactions as long as blocks are not full, acting as a natural buyer of last resort for blockspace. However, ordinals and Runes/BRC-20 are time-preference aware (they can choose to wait, paying low fees, or pay high fees for fast inclusion in a block) while rollup operators cannot be. Their proofs will be submitted, at a fixed rate in time, no matter the fee rate. This kind of agnostic demand is most reflexive on fees precisly because it competes not just to be included in a block (4MB x size of the mempool) but for the very next block (only 4MB available). As the utility for Bitcoin as the settlement chain for all economic activity continues to grow, we can expect these types of demand to increase, further impacting fees to the upside. In that case, the economic case for rollups may become less clear as their attractiveness compared to the Lightning Network in terms of costs starts to be less competitive. In SOTB_2, the second part of this research series, we’ll dive deeper into how the activation of different opcodes could affect the efficiency and decentralization of Bitcoin rollups. In the meantime, we can just leave readers with the following idea: Governance discussions are always difficult ones to have, but I do believe that more of them are warranted when it comes to Bitcoin rollups. The way I see it, it is a typical chicken-and-egg problem: We want to have rollups to scale and bring new functionality to Bitcoin. The only way to have them now is by reactivating OP_CAT, but OP_CAT enables other things that are not necessary for rollups while being inefficient at verifying zero-knowledge proofs. Should we prove the demand for optimistic rollups without a new op_code first, then activate a dedicated op_code to optimize them? Or should we activate OP_CAT first to prove the demand for rollups at the risk of them being inefficient, which could turn users away from them? We do not have the answer to this question but we can only hope that rollup teams will come up with an answer by the end of the year. In the meantime, other covenant proposals such as LNHANCE (including CTV) or TX_HASH could help Bitcoin to scale outside or rollups. 


The Thesis for Bitcoin Rollups and Bridge Innovation In this new landscape of Bitcoin L2s, the competition between sidechains and rollups will be fierce. As we’ve outlined, a common misconception within the space is that sidechains are not interesting because they are more centralized than L2s and that rollups are just a new form of sidechains. For sidechains, the bullish case is that bringing EVM compatibility to the Bitcoin ecosystem will spark the resurgence of defi activity for Bitcoiners in search of yield opportunities. As a reminder, over $9.3 billion is currently locked in WBTC according to DeFillama. Bringing this activity back to more Bitcoin-native solutions is imperative if Bitcoin is ever to succeed as a settlement chain for economic activity. Furthermore, we believe that the innovations brought by new sidechain designs can help to mitigate some of the centralizing issues plaguing previous designs. Both Optimized and Reinforced Bridge designs have interesting value propositions that could convince enough users and institutions to participate in these ecosystems. When talking about Bitcoin sidechains, we have to remember that their primary goal remains disintermediated economic activity, not censorship resistance for peer-to-peer cash. As such, participants in those networks will have different priorities, with economic incentives being at the top of the list. For rollups, the innovation of BitVM can bring them very close to actual Bitcoin L2s, with trust minimization at the core of their designs. Sure, rollups on Bitcoin will have a ton of challenges to overcome, but they are being built in the true spirit of Bitcoin cypherpunks. Teams leveraging zero-knowledge-proofs represent an invaluable opportunity for Bitcoin to increase its scalability while preserving privacy and cryptographic security. The reason why it can be hard for critics to see value in these innovations is what we’re calling the “low fee rate bias.” For years now, bitcoin fees have been artificially low because its adoption has been slowed down by speculation and usage of off-chain exchanges to settle transactions. However, this bias will rapidly disappear once fees become unbearably high for most users. This is when the panic will hit, and when the limitations on the base chain will start to become obvious. When this moment happens, we expect sidechains and rollups to become immediate successes as users rush for the exits. In his piece titled “The bridge race is on. Godspeed my friends,” Janusz from Bitcoin Layers correctly outlines that sidechains and rollups are now in a race — a race for dominance of all of the capturable capital either sitting in Bitcoin wallets or altcoin protocols. “Thus, I’m at least concluding that, based on our research of sidechains and L2s, Bitcoin benefits from conversations related to improved bridging mechanisms. I believe that the most successful Bitcoin L2s, long-term, will either be supported by a variation of BitVM2, proposed opcode changes, or a combination of both. A takeaway I had from Nashville is that these systems may even be complimentary.”The rise of sidechains is only a consequence of projects trying to front-run what is shaping up to be the biggest narrative for Bitcoin in the coming years. A new narrative that will be accompanied by billions of dollars in new capital is looking to find attractive opportunities within the most secured and largest digital asset — bitcoin. Revolutions are messy, chaotic, and by definition, they tend to surprise the people who are the least expecting it. The L2 revolution on Bitcoin follows the same path. It might be hard to make sense of everything that has been happening, however, the direction of this revolution has never been clearer. We are heading for the next step in the journey toward hyperbitcoinization.

Bitcoin Magazine,"Privacy and Pain: Craig Raw, Creator Of Sparrow Wallet, On Self-Custody","Tue, 03 Sep 2024 20:02:24 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/privacy-and-pain-craig-raw-creator-of-sparrow-wallet-on-self-custody,"An interview with Craig Raw, creator of the popular Sparrow Wallet, on Bitcoin privacy best practices and pain as a teacher. From ""The Privacy Issue"".","This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine's ""The Privacy Issue"". Subscribe to receive your copy.When Craig Raw talks, you listen.His deep voice has a gravity to it, bolstering the urgency of the points he makes.It’s like that voice in the back of your head that you hear when you’ve left too much bitcoin on an exchange for too long. Or that voice that persists when your bitcoin stash isn’t quite as secure as you know it could be.It’s an uncompromised voice, constantly reminding you to follow best practices when it comes to storing and using your bitcoin.Weeks after interviewing Raw — creator of let Sparrow Wallet, a free and open-source Bitcoin desktop wallet beloved by Bitcoin enthusiasts worldwide — for this piece, both the tone of his voice as well as what he shared with me in our interview are still fresh in my mind.He’s concerned that the rhetoric around the importance of privacy and self-sovereignty as it pertains to Bitcoin is eroding and wants to remind you that both of these concepts are of the utmost importance as we move into an era where more and more bitcoin is KYC’d and/or held custodied within walled gardens (e.g., spot bitcoin ETFs).So, if privacy and self-sovereignty mean something to you, please heed Raw’s words. Learn from the tips he shares, highlighted in this piece, as well from simply using and (carefully) experimenting with Sparrow Wallet.If you choose not to, you may end up experiencing a certain pain, which, while it may be a good teacher, would otherwise have been avoidable.PRIVACYWhen it comes to storing and using your bitcoin privately, it’s important to start with the basics, according to Raw.“The first thing is to try and understand what Bitcoin is — to try and understand the UTXO model,” Raw told Bitcoin Magazine.“Try and understand the ways in which you can be more private without using any particular kinds of privacy tools,” he added.He went on to provide two examples of how to do this:Example 1: Don’t Reuse Addresses“Address reuse is unnecessary and generally is [a] very, very poor [practice],” warned Raw. “It leads to transactions being correlated on-chain.”Example 2: Don’t Use Rounded Amounts“If you create a transaction and your amount is a round number, then there’s a change output and it’s very easy to see which is which,” he explained.To expand on what Raw means in this second example, when you spend an uneven amount of bitcoin (e.g., 0.0010126 BTC), it’s more difficult for someone watching the blockchain to decipher which UTXO is the payment and which is the change. This makes it more challenging for the observer to follow your UTXO into the future.The inverse is true if you spend an even amount of bitcoin (e.g., 0.001 BTC). The observer can more easily intuit which UTXO is the payment and which is the change.Both reusing addresses and using rounded amounts are “common pitfalls that people don’t necessarily consider,” said Raw.In addition to employing these two practices, you can use Sparrow Wallet to further increase their privacy.“Sparrow offers two forms of transactions,” explained Raw. “You can either use the efficiency form, which minimizes fees, or you can use the privacy form, which constructs what we call a ‘fake two person coinjoin.’”Raw on Sparrow Wallet’s privacy form transactions:“The privacy form is a more complex transaction where it looks like you could have two people bringing funds into a transaction and then two outputs of the same amount. Anyone looking at that is looking at a transaction with more entropy, with more confusion in it. Even if you know that it's a fake two-person coinjoin, you still have to follow both of those two outputs if you're trying to follow a change of ownership flow in that transaction graph. So, that's more expensive, but it's a useful way to be able to create a more private transaction.”But what about those who don’t want to bother with UTXO management? Isn’t it just easier to use hardware wallet interfaces like Ledger Live or Trezor Suite that handle UTXO management for you?Raw seemed unaffected as I played the role of devil’s advocate in posing these two questions. He made the case in his gravelly voice that users sacrifice privacy, or their funds, when they neglect UTXO management.“You can't really abstract yourself away from the complexity of what Bitcoin is,” posited Raw. “If you want to transact on Bitcoin, you’re going to need to, at some stage, be aware of what you're doing. Otherwise, you’re likely to lose your funds or destroy whatever privacy you have.”He went on to share that wallets with simplistic interfaces that display your Bitcoin balance as if it were a bank account balance are doing a disservice to the user.“The wallet is handling a lot of the detail for you underneath,” shared Raw. “And it simply doesn’t know — it cannot know — the right decisions to make.”Raw then contextualized this statement, highlighting the fact that certain wallets don’t know the right decisions to make IF you’re looking to preserve privacy in your transactions.“If you received some funds from somewhere and then you spent those funds somewhere else, you are creating a cryptographic link on the chain which anyone can see,” he explained. “If somebody knows the identity of either of those two sides, they can start to link things up. That is a dangerous thing that I don't think people are aware of.”He likened this scenario to all of your text messages suddenly becoming public — with your name linked to them.“It’s like if we all had our chat apps and everybody could see everything everyone said and associate an identity to it,” Raw explained. “What we're talking about is the same thing, but on a financial level.”Raw doesn’t think most Bitcoin users are ready for this level of transparency.He believes people should consider whether or not they’re comfortable with publicly broadcasting information that can lead others inferring what they earn or with whom they transact. If they’re not, then they might consider taking UTXO management more seriously with the help of Sparrow Wallet, which displays users’ UTXOs by default instead of hiding them.“Sparrow is trying to give users an ability to understand what it is that they are doing, to be more safe in their transactions from a security and privacy point of view by giving them the information that they need in order to be able to manage that kind of thing.”One of the most refreshing things about Raw is that he doesn’t underestimate Bitcoin users. He seems to think of them as both capable and willing to learn, which is, in part, driven by the fact that we all value our privacy — whether we’re conscious of it or not.“Even those who say, ‘I don't need to be private’ [might change their mind] if they just spent a moment considering that they wouldn’t like their bank accounts or their email inbox and so forth to be open to everyone in the world. And that is effectively what we have with an open blockchain,” explained Raw.“I don't think it is nearly well understood enough, even amongst Bitcoiners, exactly how open and transparent the blockchain is,” he added.“They may not have privacy from their bank or their government today, but they certainly have privacy from other individuals.”THE THREAT TO PRIVACYWhile neglecting UTXO management is a threat to privacy, it’s not the threat to privacy, according to Raw. The threat, said Raw, is the ability — and desire — of Bitcoin users to self-custody their bitcoin.To illustrate how dangerous giving up custody of your bitcoin is, Raw provided a theoretical example of what relinquishing self-custody would look like if taken to the extreme:“Let’s say we have one bank in the world and that bank says, ‘Give me your bitcoin and I will give you an IOU.’ In that situation where everyone transfers their bitcoin over to that bank and the bank issues IOUs, the bank effectively has carte blanche to issue as many IOUs as they want. We’re effectively then back in the fiat world, even if we have bitcoin. I think that that's the biggest risk that Bitcoin faces today — the desire for people to self-custody the funds that they have.”Does this mean that if you use a custodial bitcoin platform for even a second, you’ve betrayed a core Bitcoin tenet and should be excommunicated from the Church of Bitcoin Maximalism?No.At least not in Raw’s estimation.“I think we just need to be very careful about relinquishing too many of those original ideals,” said Raw about ideals like oft-cited ‘not your keys, not your coins.’”At the same time, Raw believes that “Bitcoin doesn’t exist in a vacuum” and that it’s the “product of the environment in which we live today.”He shared that Wallet of Satoshi, a custodial Bitcoin Lightning wallet, has been a useful tool for the Bitcoin Ekasi project — a circular Bitcoin economy based in Raw’s home country of South Africa.While Raw admitted that Wallet of Satoshi is “obviously not ideal from a self-custody point of view,” he also shared that “it does nevertheless get people used to [using bitcoin], and there’s something powerful about that.”Raw seemed less concerned with the idea that people would use Wallet of Satoshi for small, everyday transactions and more concerned with the idea that many stop after downloading and using a custodial app like Wallet of Satoshi and don’t get around to learning about self-custody.Like many of us who’ve tried to onboard friends and loved ones to Bitcoin, stressing to them the importance of holding one’s own keys, Raw gets that many unfortunately still don’t get it, partially because many have yet to feel the pronounced sting of currency debasement.“We clearly get the pushback of ‘Why should I care? Why should this matter to me?,’” said Raw.The idea of having to exit the traditional monetary or financial system in efforts to preserve your wealth “doesn't seem very real” to many around the world, he argued.But for those who’ve lived in highly inflationary environments, learning how to properly use bitcoin isn’t a cognitive exercise — it’s something they resort to instinctively.“If your currency gets devalued by 25% overnight, then it really does become quite material to you to think ‘How do I protect myself against this?,’ Raw added.This is why Raw advises people to learn best practices when it comes to using Bitcoin before they’re thrown into a scenario in which they have to start using it. He makes this case despite the fact that he understands quite well that the greatest Bitcoin teacher is not a person or a certain class, but a feeling that we all often do our best to avoid: pain.PAIN“Maybe they start with the Wallet of Satoshi, and maybe, if the worst comes to worst, that particular service goes away,” theorized Raw.“They lose their funds, they have a painful lesson, and then they look for something better in future. I'm sure you are familiar with that journey. [Author’s note: Of course I am.] Many of the people I'm sure you have spoken to have lost funds and have learned painful lessons along the way [Author’s note: Of course they are. Many have told me this directly.],” he added.“What’s interesting, I find, is they often don't walk away for good. They come back; they try again. They try with those learnings that they've managed to gain.”So, does Raw wish this pain on people? I didn’t get that impression.He’s not cruel; he’s concerned.He also comes off as more of a realist than an idealist.And he thinks that pain will not only compel people to be more careful about how they store the private keys but about how private they keep their transactions, as well.“We don't have nearly enough focus on public opinion behind privacy, and I think the only way we're going to get there is, as is often said in the space, from people touching the stove,” said Raw.“We need that collective pain — unfortunately. I wish it weren't so, but unfortunately, I think it is necessary in order for people to take the idea of privacy seriously,” he added.Raw went on to share that he believes that collective pain is coming and that it’s likely necessary for us as a society to truly recognize just how much we value privacy — a cornerstone of civil society.“Without the ability to be private, we cannot have a free society. It is simply not possible,” deadpanned Raw. “So, if people want to be free, and I believe that, in general, that is true, then they will need to realize at some point that they need this concept of privacy and the ability to have it in their own lives in order to achieve that goal.”The good news is that while this wave of collective pain may wash over society, you can do something to insulate yourself from it. You can download Sparrow Wallet after you finish reading this article and begin to work through some of the discomfort that comes with learning to use new technology — which will likely be less painful than having your financial information doxxed.The Less Painful PathLuckily for us, Raw designed Sparrow to be intuitive, leading more curious users down a path that educates them if they’re willing to spend some time tinkering with the software.“Sparrow was always designed to be not just a Bitcoin wallet but an educator, as well,” explained Raw.“That's why I've tried to put as much detail as I can into it. I designed it in a way, and I hope I've got this right, that gradually reveals information to people who want to dig deeper into things,” he added.“You can use Sparrow in a fairly light way, and you should when you're just getting into it. But, as time goes on, there's no harm in clicking or hovering over things, reading the tool tips, and trying to understand more about what you're doing.”What’s perhaps most remarkable about what Raw has built is that he’s created it and given it to the world for free. Raw doesn’t monetize Sparrow Wallet. As mentioned earlier, it’s free and open-source software that he continues to iterate upon for no reason other than he “believe[s] that it has some value.”For someone who realizes just how much is at stake in a world where the powers that be are trying their best to trap us in a panopticon, Raw’s work keeps him optimistic.“Ultimately it comes down to, for me, the simple idea that Bitcoin is hope,” Raw concluded, with his stern voice softened for just a moment.“What is hope? Hope is the idea that tomorrow can be better than today, that one can look forward to something. Bitcoin represents that. That's why it’s the key driving force above everything else to me.”Download Sparrow Wallet: https://sparrowwallet.com/download/Questions From The Plebs:The following questions were crowdsourced from X.Will you ever create a Sparrow mobile app?The desktop computer is the most capable device that many people have when they are looking to do self-custody of their funds. That's really what Sparrow is for.When it comes to the real important self-custody operations, you want to use the most capable device that you own. It gives you the most screen real estate to display the full context of what you're trying to do.There's a limitation on mobile devices, which is natural just due to the size of the screen. You can see the obvious difference if you are using a mobile app versus using something like Sparrow. There's a big difference in terms of the amount of information that you can show. So, for me, it was natural to want to focus on the desktop.I think that there are pros and cons in terms of security on both. Personally, I believe that the desktop can be made a more secure device than the phone. Again, I recognize that there are certain times when that isn't true, but in general, I think it's true. That's the most important thing.The decisions you make at the start of a project echo throughout its life. It's really important to make good architectural decisions at the very start because that will inform everything further down the road.Is using ecash created from protocols like Cashu and Fedimint a good way to preserve transaction privacy?It's too early to say. If you're talking about a project that hasn't really even reached a meaningful production level yet, it's just really too early to say. They haven't been put to the test.They’re certainly interesting. I think really from a technological point of view, there's a lot of positive things to be said, but from an actual implementation and a regulatory point of view, they haven't been put to the test yet. We'll just have to see.I will obviously keep an eye on all of those things, but I think people should treat any new technology with a great deal of caution before they trust any significant amount of funds to it.Will you ever integrate Lightning into Sparrow Wallet?The best I can say is not at this time. I'm really focused on the ideal of financial self-sovereignty and that's really, at this stage anyway, on the sort of on-chain level.Now, there might be a time in the future where, for example, fees are too high and it's not practical to do that anymore. We simply don't know the way that things are going to play out.Right now, Sparrow is a desktop app. It's a client app. It's not designed to be a server. It's not designed to be run all the time.If you’re trying to design something for Lightning, you very quickly run into this idea of needing to be online to receive funds. As soon as you start to work with that requirement, you get into a lot of complexity around “Am I online? What happens if I’m not online? Do I then need a third party involved?”As I said, the decisions you make at the start of a project echo through its life. Sparrow is good at what it does. It's an app that is designed for self-custody, for cold storage, and the important thing about cold storage is that it should be cold. You shouldn't be necessarily running your cold storage wallet open on Sparrow all the time. That wallet should be closed, and you should be able to close Sparrow, as well.So, as soon as you start to move away from those key goals, you're trying to find some kind of compromise, and that needs to be treated with a lot of caution because it's a different thing than what I'm building today."
Bitcoin Magazine,Relai’s Bitcoin Mission: Bringing Europeans the Orange Coin Despite the Red Tape,"Tue, 03 Sep 2024 15:13:42 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/relais-bitcoin-mission-bringing-europeans-the-orange-coin-despite-the-red-tape,"Relai co-founder and CEO Julian Liniger wants to onboard as many EU and UK citizens as possible to Bitcoin, even if that means having to jump through regulatory hoops.","Company Name: RelaiFounders: Julian Liniger and Adem BilicanDate Founded: July 2020Location of Headquarters: Zurich, SwitzerlandAmount of Bitcoin Held in Treasury: One-third of Relai’s treasuryNumber of Employees: 30Website: https://relai.app/Public or Private? PrivateJulian Liniger is on a mission to give more Europeans exposure to Bitcoin — despite regulatory bodies making it more difficult for Bitcoin businesses like the company he co-founded, Relai, to operate on the continent.Liniger, a clean-cut Swiss entrepreneur who was one of Forbes’ 30 Under 30 in 2022, believes that there is much work to be done in bringing bitcoin to Europeans, even if new regulatory regimes like Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) create more red tape around serving EU and UK citizens.“We are working to make Bitcoin more accessible, easier to use and easier to buy for normal people,” Liniger told Bitcoin Magazine.“We're mainly targeting newcomers — the 90% of the people that don't have easy access to bitcoin yet or that just haven't tried yet because they were also not educated yet. In Europe, around 8% to 10% of people have bitcoin and 90% still don't,” he added.To reach this 90%, Liniger and the team at Relai have had to obtain the proper licenses and follow certain regulatory procedures, like requiring that customers complete Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures in order to use the app. Keeping Relai compliant is a tedious process, but Liniger, Libertarian-minded yet pragmatic, sees it as a necessary evil.“I try to build the best company and onboard as many people as possible to Bitcoin in the most Bitcoiner way possible, which is certainly self-custodial and Bitcoin only, but we also need to stay in the realm of what is legal,” Liniger explained.“So, we adhere to these regulations, whether I as an individual like it or not. As a business person, I need to make these decisions,” he added.Wise words from someone who’s no stranger to taking the hard road.The Road To RelaiLiniger was first introduced to bitcoin and cryptocurrency in 2015 and quickly went down the broader crypto rabbit hole.In his early 20s, he watched bitcoin’s price skyrocket from $1,000 to $20,000 and experienced the Ethereum ICO boom from up close as he spent a portion of 2017 in San Francisco, then a hotbed for crypto developer activity, on an exchange semester while pursuing his master’s degree in business administration (MBA).Upon returning home to Switzerland in 2018, he turned down a well-paid consulting job in the world of traditional finance and instead founded Bravis, a crypto consulting firm. During this time, he helped banks prepare to offer Bitcoin services.“[We] helped them to position strategically in this new world and also to conceptualize some products, like actually starting to offer Bitcoin custody, trading, etc., which was inconceivable back then,” said Liniger. “Now, a lot of Swiss banks are doing it.”By 2019, Liniger’s entrepreneurial drive had kicked into a new gear. He wanted to build something bigger than a consulting firm. This urge coincided with his personally adopting a bitcoin-not-crypto investment thesis and realizing that no app in the Swiss or broader European market allowed users to buy, non-custodially hold, and use bitcoin (all of which Relai does).That same year, Liniger and his soon-to-be co-founder at Relai, Adem Bilican, participated in a hackathon and made it into the finals with their concept for the company. By 2020, the two had built a prototype and had raised money from two angel investors. By summer of that year, the Relai app went live with the intention of first providing access to bitcoin and then offering other crypto assets.The Bitcoin community didn’t like the latter notion, though.Bitcoin OnlyLiniger recalled introducing Relai’s promo phrase “easy crypto investing” and the instant backlash it drew from Bitcoiners.“They were like ‘Why crypto? Just stick to Bitcoin and make it really great,’” said Liniger, adding that Relai’s users urged him and his partner to simply make the app as easy-to-use as possible and to incorporate then-new Bitcoin technology like Lightning, both of which Relai have done.Liniger, who’d first conceptualized Relai as a Bitcoin-first crypto app, made the decision to make it a Bitcoin-only app.“[I thought] it wouldn’t hurt to also have a couple other [cryptos],” recalled Liniger.“But then I realized it actually would hurt. All the other [cryptos] don't make sense in the long run if you want to be a savings app. Bitcoin is a savings technology; it's digital gold,” he added, noting that other crypto assets neither purport to be or act as a store of value. Liniger also noted that by 2020, both Bitcoin-only venture capital firms and more Bitcoin-only companies were beginning to arise, and he felt that Relai could be a part of this trend.“We had River in the US, Bull Bitcoin in Canada, etc, and we were thinking we could be the leader of this category in Europe,” said Liniger.Developing A European User BaseBased in Switzerland, Liniger and the Relai team had a leg up on the rest of Europe, as regulations in Switzerland are a bit more relaxed than those in the European Union. Liniger, however, did not want to just serve Swiss citizens for two reasons.The first is that the percentage of Swiss citizens that own bitcoin is closer to 20%, according to Liniger, as compared to the 10% or so of Europeans from other countries. There’s less of a market for those who are new to Bitcoin to go after in Switzerland as compared to those living in the EU and UK.The second reason is that Switzerland’s population is about 8.7 million, whereas the total population of the EU plus UK is over 500 million.In the past four years, Relai has acquired 120,000 users across the continent and Liniger says the growth curve is accelerating even as the company faces certain regulatory impediments.“We are not currently allowed to actively acquire users in the EU for regulatory reasons,” explained Liniger. “We can do active marketing tactics in Switzerland, but not in all the EU countries.”Even in the absence of marketing, Relai continues to grow its user base, especially in Germany, Italy and France.The number of Relai users in these countries will likely continue to grow rapidly as the company is in the process of obtaining licensing from France that will allow the company to advertise to EU customers.“Probably by the end of this year, we will get the French license approval,” said Liniger. “Then, at the beginning of next year, there's going to be MiCA and this [French license] is going to transition into a MiCA license, which will then allow us to actively acquire customers in all the EU.”Once this happens, Liniger believes that upwards of 90% of bitcoin purchases in the EU and UK will happen via Relai.The Cost Of ComplianceWhile Liniger, notably calm and level-headed, talks about the process of overcoming regulatory hurdles, one can’t help but imagine how frustrating the process has been for him and his team.He stated that regulatory bodies and requirements have become significantly more intrusive for not only startups like Relai, but established financial institutions, as well.“I heard stories from our CFO who used to work at ING, a huge bank, four or five years ago,” shared Liniger. “He was in one of these risk management compliance departments, which, when he joined, was like three or four people and the team has 10x’d in the four or five years since.”Liniger went on to explain that many of Relai’s peers have up to a third of their team focused on regulatory compliance.While he’s hopeful that the likes of Coinbase and Kraken fighting the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in court will set some sort of precedent that will get regulators to back off, he doesn’t see the trend of regulatory overreach reversing just yet, which seems slightly worrisome to him.“We don't have these resources at all,” said Liniger, comparing Relai’s funds to the type of money that Coinbase and Kraken have in their coffers to fight regulators in court.This is part of the reason Relai didn’t fight back in court when regulators told them they had to KYC all of their customers.KYC Required, But Do Not DespairRelai recently announced that all users would have to provide their personal information by October 31, 2024 to continue using the app, after four years of being able to offer services without requiring users to do so.“We were just basically forced to by the EU regulators and, increasingly, also from the Swiss regulators,” said Liniger in regard to having to make customers complete the KYC process. “The EU is pressuring Switzerland.”While Liniger didn’t sound particularly happy about this, he also didn’t sound defeated. Instead, he seemed as focused as ever on his mission to bring bitcoin to the 90% of EU and UK citizens who still don’t have any.“50% plus of the people will want some access to Bitcoin just because it’s a savings technology,” explained Liniger, which means he still has about 200 million customers (a 170x of Relai’s current users base) to reach in the broader jurisdiction Relai serves.Admittedly, he knows some of these potential customers will opt to buy bitcoin or bitcoin ETFs that major financial institutions custody for them instead of using Relai, though he believes that the youth, who are more distrusting of established financial institutions, will opt to use Relai.“The more progressive younger people will want to take custody themselves,” explained Liniger. “They will use something like Relai where they can buy directly into self custody and set up a savings plan, using it as a sovereign way of saving their money and their purchasing power into the future.”"
Bitcoin Magazine,Why The DNC Doesn't Care About Bitcoin,"Tue, 03 Sep 2024 13:20:21 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/why-the-dnc-doesnt-care-about-bitcoin,"Politicians cater to their voting base, it's that simple. If you want politicians to care about Bitcoin, their voters need to care.","Two weeks ago I attended the Democratic National Convention. The chief reason I did so was to try and encourage an impartiality to our coverage of politics as it relates to the election and Bitcoin here at Bitcoin Magazine. Earlier this year we were invited the the Republican National Convention at the last minute, after David Bailey’s coordination with the Trump campaign began preceding his speaking at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville in July. It bothered me to see people associated with this company taking such a one-sided stand with the Republican Party, despite the reality that in fact many more Republican politicians support Bitcoin compared to Democrats. The Republican Party even formally integrated Bitcoin into their public policy platform at the convention. The Democrats have not. That is not to say that no Democrats support Bitcoin. At the national level Representative Ro Khanna from California, Ritchie Torres from New York, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand also from New York have been vocal supporters of Bitcoin in Congress. These politicians exist, they are vocal, but they do not seem to have the same resonance with the rest of the party or their voting base that exists in the Republican Party. During the first day that I attended, Bitcoin was not mentioned a single time. It wasn’t a very prominent topic at the RNC, but it was mentioned. It was included in the party policy platform. No such inclusion took place at the DNC. The focus of the first day was on the coming election, Kamala versus Trump. I do have to say that not much of the discussion centered around policy. It was mostly rhetorical, and focused on general issues concerning Democratic voters, interspersed with the type of rah-rah language one would expect at an event focused on candidate selection for the Democrat party this election cycle. While no policies explicitly were touched on, many of the issues that Democrats find important were. Minority inclusion, women’s rights, well paying jobs and union security, healthcare (especially as it relates to Covid which is still circulating even though people don’t place the same focus on it), and the perceived attempt by Republicans to roll back progress from the point of view of Democrats on many of these issues. A number of union leaders spoke either in person or with recorded messages during the convention’s first day, the Arizona Pipefitters and Pumbers Union, the Communications Workers of America Union (CWA), International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), the American Federation of State, County, and Munipical Employees (AFSCME). All of them had much to say on the topic of lost jobs during Covid, and the recovery of jobs that took place under the Biden Administration. Another big issue was union pension funds. Union jobs are generally sought, and coveted, due to the benefits and retirement security that comes along with them, not simply the good base pay. Is anything standing out to you? Maybe the fact that Bitcoin actually can synergize and help advance these goals that Democrats seem to care about? Bitcoin can absolutely help minorities suffering economically, at least over long time horizons. Ignoring the aberration of this current market cycle, people holding bitcoin over long time periods have absolutely benefited from increased purchasing power. While obviously it takes money to make money, and people starting with less will realize less in terms of appreciation, anyone with money to save has historically in the long term wound up with more purchasing power. This won’t help people in poverty as much as those with a large surplus of money to invest, but it will help. Bitcoin can also assist women in maintaining access to healthcare that is increasingly being banned in parts of the US. Financial institutions have increasingly been censoring financial transactions deemed troublesome culturally, despite their legal status. There is no reason to assume that this activity will continue only affecting people on the right side of the political spectrum. Bitcoin is an alternative to traditional financial institutions. And I shouldn’t need to tell people that it can function even for services that are outright deemed illegal. Pension funds for workers have also recently started taking conservative exposure to bitcoin, which again looking at historical long term performance can be a huge benefit to solvency issues in the long term facing pensions all over the country. Bitcoin can even be a massive boon to renewable energy, something liberals care very deeply about as it relates to mitigating the consequences of global climate change and maintaining our natural environment. Bitcoin miners are in a very unique position, with AI operators only recently starting to fill a similar niche, to be buyers of stranded renewable energy before it becomes connected to the grid. This allows revenue the instant these projects are finished, rather than having to wait to be connected to retail energy consumers on the grid. That is to say nothing about the general open access nature of Bitcoin, and how it can advance the philosophy of freedom and inclusion globally by providing people with an option in the face of fighting and resisting totalitarian regimes worldwide. Bitcoin is a natural fit for many of the proclaimed beliefs and principles of Democrats. So why is there no attention from the Party at large? Why is there no mention or inclusion in their policy platform similar to Republicans? It’s the base. The recent American Bitcoin Survey by the Nakamoto Project showed us that bitcoin ownership is a bipartisan thing, that it is not concentrated on the right as is generally perceived in the public. So why does that perception continue to exist? Narratives. Stories. Messaging. The reason the Democratic Party does not care as widely about Bitcoin as a policy issue isn’t because Democrats and liberals don’t use it or hold it, it is because of the wider narratives. The perception is that Bitcoin is a rightwing thing. The associations made between Bitcoin and important issues come across as rightwing. Democratic politicians at large are not going to care about Bitcoin in terms of policy, and cater to Bitcoiners with positive policy, unless those narratives and associations change. This is the reality of politics, politicians cater to their voters. They do not generally take forward thinking initiatives on their own unless they see some benefit in terms of positive voter reaction and perception towards that initiative. This is politics. Shouting at politicians won’t change that, demonizing them for apathetic or negative reactionary responses to the perception of it being rightwing in a polarized political climate won’t change that. You need to reach the voting base. That is the only thing that will cause a change in attitude and action on the part of Democratic politicians. People who are on the left need to be shown that Bitcoin is something that aligns with and can advance their political goals and agendas, the same way that wider perception has been propagated on the right. It will definitely be an uphill battle given the baggage of past and existing perception, but this is the only way that the increasingly cemented perception of Bitcoin being a rightwing thing can be pushed back against. Without concerted effort to demonstrate and build narratives showing left leaning people that Bitcoin can, and does, align with their values, Bitcoin is doomed to be forced into a left/right partisan paradigm. "
Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Hashrate Records New ATH Surpassing 740 EH/s,"Tue, 03 Sep 2024 10:13:54 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-hashrate-records-new-ath-surpassing-740-eh-s,"The Bitcoin network hashrate hit a new all-time high of 746 EH/s on September 3rd, showcasing improved security and fundamentals. This comes as Bitcoin prices decline, underscoring the disconnect between short-term pricing and long-term network health.","The Bitcoin network hash rate reached a new all-time high on September 3rd, surpassing 740 exahashes per second (EH/s). This comes even as Bitcoin prices trade below $60,000.JUST IN: #Bitcoin's hash rate hit a new ALL TIME HIGH 🚀 pic.twitter.com/BiLY3pRRIV— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 3, 2024

A higher hash rate reflects more computational resources spent processing transactions and mining new Bitcoin. This is despite Bitcoin sliding over 10% this week, which highlights the disconnect between network fundamentals and short-term pricing.Leading mining companies such as Whatsminer and MicroBT are launching advanced machines to take advantage of the surge in hash rate. Whatsminer has introduced four new mining rigs and a forthcoming solar-powered mining container system. Meanwhile, MicroBT has rolled out its M6XS+ miners, capable of processing between 190 and 450 terahash.Riot Platforms also purchased Block Mining for $92.5 million to enhance its hash rate and broaden its market presence. Additionally, miners are looking into AI integration and potential acquisition opportunities to address persistent identity challenges in the industry.Bitcoin's rising hash rate indicates strong confidence in its long-term sustainability. With significant advancements in mining technology and supportive political conditions enhancing profits, miners are rapidly expanding their infrastructure to handle transactions and secure the Bitcoin network.While the hash rate doesn't directly influence Bitcoin's price, it reinforces the underlying network security. Hashrate milestones also tend to precede bullish market moves and Bitcoin's halving events."
Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoiners and Wobblies: Labor Day Edition,"Mon, 02 Sep 2024 13:47:01 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoiners-and-wobblies-labor-day-edition-,"A look at the history of the American and global Labor Movement, and the parallels between Bitcoin's and the labor movement's evolutions. ","Recently, I’ve been reading about the foundations of the American Labor Movement. Specifically, the birth of the Industrial Workers of the World and a group called the Wobblies, a nickname given to IWW Members. At its peak, the IWW had over 150,000 members in 1917, with global memberships and significant power and influence. While the IWW was a socialist leaning organization in theory, many of its core values were intertwined into the DNA of the American Labor movement, and was undeniably pivotal to the development of organized labor and a strong working class following the industrial revolution. The parallels between some of the IWW’s origins and ideologies and Bitcoin are significant, and shall be demonstrated with quotes rather than boring you to death with in depth history.All quotes are attributed to the book “Wobblies: A Graphic History of The Industrial Workers of the World (Buhle/Schulman.Origins and Genesis“No one can say exactly where the inspiration for the IWW came from. The origins are too numerous both in the U.S. and abroad…”Similarly, the nickname of the Wobblies, has no clear origin. Naturally, some of the mythology around Bitcoin comes to mind, and while Bitcoin’s origins are clearly documented via white paper and email communications, its creator or creators is or are shrouded in mystery. As Bitcoin caught gained popularity, its growth was decentralized and organic. In another parallel, while the IWW and American Labor Movement had prior inspirations, it was a pioneer in the sense of organizing labor across ethnic, gender, religious and other demographic differences. “After the Civil War, massive industry grew up faster than anyone could have imagined, with previously unthinkable wealth accruing to the bankers but with millions of desperately poor working people, employed at low wages or unemployed in the frequent economic recessions”From the financial crisis, to post-covid wealth accumulation within the ranks of billionaires, to a current AI, robotics and self-automation boom underway, this story is all too familiar. However, recessions have been all but outlawed, replaced by government intervention, currently placing systems as large as Pensions and Social Security on the equivilant of government welfare and dependence.Wobblies and Bitcoiners“The Wobbly, male or female, Asian or Occidental, black, brown, red or white, was only an ordinary human being in physique”We feel the same about Bitcoiners. We have all met some of the most inspiring people in our lives in this space. It is both the character, grit and determination that allows individuals to discover and understand Bitcoin, as well as the character building journey a Bitcoiner must take to fully grasp Bitcoin and share it with a world that rounds out what many of us believe is the most talented and motivated communities in the world.“Their story was collaborative, collective, not reliant on any one hero or heroine-as heroic (or tragic) as individual Wobblies lives might be.”Kill your heroes. Death to Ego. Bitcoin doesn't need any of us.Solidarity: A movement greater than the individual“The world of the Wobblies was one realized in its best moments by solidarity across race, ethnic, gender and nationality lines”The beauty of Bitcoin is it requires no trust between those who transact with each other. And in doing such, Bitcoin allows humans to deconstruct the daily head to toe analysis we perform on each other daily; an analysis that instinctually calls out our differences, with roots in paranoia and fear. While blind solidarity amongst Bitcoiners is the antithesis of “dont trust, verify,” there is a strong natural bond between Bitcoiners. I believe the future of Bitcoin, when facing its largest tests ahead, will very much depend upon a deepened solidarity between those who subscribe to Bitcoin’s Genesis, core values, and blind commitment to being honest, true and trustless.AFL vs. Knights of Labor“The earliest mass movement for an eight hour workday during 1885-86, highlighted the different roles of two kinds of labor movements. The American Federation of Labor, founded in 1883, sought to organize skilled workers (almost entirely white and male) only…whereas the Knights of Labor, founded in 1869 as a secret society..extended its membership to almost all workers (except Chinese), including African-Americans and women.”The AFL and its exclusive country club brand of membership outlasted the ultimate demise of the Knights of Labor and still exists today as the AFL-CIO. In reading about the different philosophies of the AFL and Knights of Labor it brings up parallels within the Bitcoin community, frequently heard criticisms of Bitcoin Maxi’s, as well as Bitcoin v. Crypto. I leave you the reader to draw your own thoughts here, as parallels are in their nature loose affiliations at best.The Movement“In the industrially advanced United States, the working class had been prepared ready to assume control of society and to replace “politics” and the “State” with a government of direct rule. As Marx had pointed out about the Paris Commune (and Lenin would repeat for the Soviets), the existing government apparatus could not be infiltrated and taken over piece-meal; it had to be dissolved and repalced by a truly democratic, modern form of government”There are two camps of thought in Bitcoin, one that calls for a full collapse of the current financial system, and migration to a Bitcoin Standard, and another that insists Bitcoin can co-exist with and even surpass the current financial system without the latters' collapse. While money is not identical to government in this parallel, the amount in which money is entrenched in the legacy financial system, is prodigious, and this always sparks interesting debate between Bitcoiners.“For the IWW..the familiar problem of the socialist movement being notoriously small in the US could be solved in a new way. ‘Educating’ workers into becoming socialists, through newspapers, speeches and election campaigns, was too passive and not very successful. Workers needed to educate themselves, in and through their own actions and self-organization.”Some opposing parallels here. Immediately, I think of a core value of Bitcoiners, which is that, no one can walk this path for you. Proof of Work can not be sidestepped or bypassed. No individual or group can cheat the quest for knowledge, both about Bitcoin and the system it sits poised to replace. The Bitcoin journeys of individuals and membership-based orgs, absent continuous learning and education, often end up in loss or disappointment. Those who do the work, find that their knowledge of money blossoms, and few if any have ever turned back after coming to deeply understand Bitcoin.Simultaneously, my mind shifts to the oligarchy’s attempts at no less than a 10 year negative media blitz on all things Bitcoin. It slowed the train but it did not work. The other day, I randomly asked people at the 3rd Street promenade in Santa Monica, to share their thoughts on Bitcoin. Overwhelmingly positive, and having some foundation in accuracy. The movement to dissuade people from finding Bitcoin was a delay of the inevitable at best. Because nothing can stop an idea whose time has come.ConclusionsOn this labor day, I gaze upon the deeply polarized two party political system of the dominant world power today. And as I see labor unions align with one party, at the expense of creating division within their ranks, I see a labor movement that has drifted from its original foundation. While the IWW rose and fell, its pinnacle represented an unwavering movement, a solidarity and commitment to the worker above everything else. And there is power in that. I see parallels today in Bitcoin.The core principles of Bitcoin transcend our differences and are worth fighting for. At Proof of Workforce, our method of fighting for these values is through education-based Bitcoin adoption for workers, unions, pension funds and municipalities. And in doing so, we are sharing not just bitcoin the asset, or Bitcoin the Network, we are communicating the Genesis of Bitcoin and its values, so that they may not be lost in the progression of time.Finally, Bitcoin is a natural evolution of the labor movement, sharing many similarities and parallels. However, unlike the labor movement, the worker can rely on Bitcoin, absent any allegiance to any political party, leader or oligarchy. And in this sense, Bitcoin and its system of values stands to be adopted by unions all over the world. And in doing so, unions around the world can become re-aligned to their Genesis Story. A story where solidarity comes above all, a story where workers come together to hold onto the very productive property dependent upon their labor. A story where, as many workers stand to be phased out of relevance due to automation and AI, the unions representing them look forward and claim ownership of the most accessible and promising productive property available to them today; Bitcoin.This is a guest post by Dom Bei.

Bitcoin Magazine,The Fight for Bitcoin Privacy Has Truly Begun,"Fri, 30 Aug 2024 20:27:57 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/the-fight-for-bitcoin-privacy-has-truly-begun,"""Then they fight you"" has finally arrived. Financial privacy is in the crosshairs and Bitcoin's promise as ""freedom money"" is at stake. From ""The Privacy Issue"".","This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine's ""The Privacy Issue"". Subscribe to receive your copy.First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.The quote—commonly misattributed to Mahatma Gandhi—has been overused to the point of exhaustion in the Bitcoin space, typically invoking the suggestion that the laughing stage is over. In most of these cases, the insinuation that the fighting stage has begun was overblown, however; perhaps inspired by little more than a comment from some politician or finance professional.But on April 24 of this year, the quote finally rang true.On that day, the US Department of Justice (DoJ), via the District Court of the Southern District of New York, announced the indictment of Samourai Wallet co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill. Rodriguez, Samourai Wallet’s CEO who pseudonymously operated the @SamouraiWallet handle on Twitter/X, was arrested early that morning in his home state of Pennsylvania. Hill (AKA TDev, or @SamouraiDev on Twitter), meanwhile, was arrested in Lisbon, Portugal, where he resided; at the time of writing this article, the DoJ intends to extradite him to the US.Both of them are accused of running an unlicensed money transmitter, and earning millions of dollars in fees doing so. For this, Rodriguez and Hill each face a maximum prison sentence of five years.On top of that, the duo was charged with money laundering as well. According to the DoJ, Samourai Wallet was used to launder over $100 million dollars of crime proceeds from dark net markets, fraudulent schemes and other illicit activities. This could add a whopping maximum 20 years to their sentence.Samourai Wallet’s web servers and domain (samourai.io) were also seized, rendering the wallet largely unusable. (Though users could still recover their bitcoin through other wallets, using their backup seeds.)Around the same time as the Samourai Wallet developers’ arrests, the FBI issued a public warning to cryptocurrency users, stating that they may lose their funds due to criminal seizures if they don’t move their holdings to regulated entities. Although Samourai Wallet was not mentioned by the agency, the timing of the note suggests the warning was no coincidence.Together, it seemed to represent a step change for Bitcoin and Bitcoin development.

Bitcoin PrivacyBitcoin comes from a long tradition of privacy activism. In a world where money is increasingly going digital, Cypherpunks have since the 1990s attempted to create a form of electronic cash in order to prevent an Orwellian future where every transaction can be monitored and potentially censored. Similarly, Douglas Jackson around the turn of the millennium offered a gold-backed digital payment system with privacy features called eGold, which eventually had to shut down operations because Jackson did not register his company as a money transmitter.eGold required a money transmitter license because it held gold in reserve on behalf of its users, but it has since then generally been assumed that creators of non-custodial wallet software did not qualify as money transmitters. As long as developers never took control of user funds themselves, they did not need to register with the United States Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and therefore also wouldn’t need to apply anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) checks on their users— or so it was thought.Crucially, this assumption was in large part based on guidance from FinCEN itself, published in 2013.By extension, many presumed that developers wouldn’t be held accountable for how their software is used. If non-custodial Bitcoin wallets are used to launder money, those engaged in the activity itself would be breaking the law, but it was generally not believed to be the responsibility of the creators of these wallets to prevent this from happening in the first place.Samourai Wallet was, indeed, a non-custodial wallet. Users stored their own private keys in their wallet software, so Rodriguez or Hill at no point controlled these bitcoin. By default, the Samourai Wallet application did communicate with a central server to send and receive transactions, but even this could be sidestepped by connecting to the Samourai Dojo: a personal, internet-connected device that embedded a Bitcoin node.Importantly, Samourai Wallet was marketed as a privacy wallet, and its main privacy feature—Whirlpool—did fully depend on the Samourai server. Specifically, Samourai Wallet users could, coordinated through this central server, collaborate to make CoinJoin transactions. In groups of five, users would contribute an equal amount of bitcoin (for example 0.01 BTC) to a transaction, which sent back the same amount to each of them.Because there is no way to link specific transaction inputs to specific transaction outputs, this essentially “mixed” their coins. Blockchain analysts would be unable to trace back the history of these coins, except to the extent that they’d know they must have come from one of these five inputs. Furthermore, Whirlpool users could opt to automatically repeat such mixes, even further obfuscating their transaction history.In addition, Samourai Wallet offered a service called Ricochet. This enabled users to send bitcoin to newly generated addresses they controlled themselves multiple times, somewhat frustrating blockchain analysis as well. (Although this is possible with any Bitcoin wallet, Samourai Wallet automated the process.)The allegation, as put forth by the DoJ, is that these tools were, indeed, used to launder money. What’s more, the federal department argues that the Samourai Wallet co-founders intended this to be the case. This accusation is largely based on public as well as private communication about their service, including some statements by Rodriguez and Hill on Twitter and in their pitch decks intended for investors, which mentioned that individuals who engaged in “illicit activity” on “restricted” or “dark/grey” markets would be among their user base.Whether these statements truly indicate that Rodriguez and Hill intended their software to be used for illicit purposes—as opposed to it just being “tough marketing talk” from developers who ultimately wanted to offer financial privacy tools—will have to be proven in court.And perhaps more importantly, the Samourai Wallet arrests challenge the long-standing assumption that developers don’t have to register as money transmitters and perform the associated AML and KYC checks.Though, this assumption had already been put to question in a different corner of the cryptocurrency space…Tornado CashIn August 2022, the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) added Tornado Cash, a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, to its OFAC list. It made interacting with the smart contract illegal under US law.Later that same month, Alexey Pertsev was arrested by the Dutch police. In the years prior, Pertsev had, along with Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, founded and operated software development company PepperSec. Key to their efforts had been the development of Tornado Cash as well as supporting infrastructure.As a smart contract, Tornado Cash technically functions autonomously. Although Pertsev helped develop the tool, it exists across thousands of Ethereum nodes around the world. After it was released, Pertsev had no way to control how it was used, or who used it. Anyone could send an amount of ETH to the smart contract, which—utilizing a cryptographic trick called zero-knowledge proofs—enabled them to withdraw that same amount from the smart contract, but to a different account. Here, too, there was no way to link the ETH going into Tornado Cash to the ETH going out, thus the smart contract essentially functioned as a “mixing” service.To make this feature effective, PepperSec also developed supporting infrastructure, which in part relied on relayers: basically, Ethereum users could be tasked with paying the Tornado Cash fee, for which they in turn were rewarded TORN tokens. This aspect of the design—the relayers and the TORN tokens—centered around a different smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, which technically was implemented as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).In addition to that, PepperSec operated a service that offered an easily accessible graphical user interface (GUI) for the smart contract and its surrounding infrastructure.Importantly, Tornado Cash as well as the supporting infrastructure was all non-custodial software. Pertsev, Storm and Semenov developed code, but they at no point controlled any of the ETH going into the smart contract. Although they couldn’t control how Tornado Cash could be used, it’s less obvious to what extent the same was true for the supporting infrastructure. (Like many things Ethereum, claims of “decentralization” were at least in part grounded in marketing more so than in technical reality.)In either case, for the Dutch prosecutor, the fact that Pertsev and his colleagues never took custody of any ETH did not make much of a difference. In her view, PepperSec was de facto ran as a business, which—albeit indirectly through the TORN token—earned an income from Tornado Cash and the supporting infrastructure. She argued this made Pertsev responsible for how Tornado Cash was used, and by whom.In particular, she pointed out, Tornado Cash had been used to launder well over a billion US dollars, for example by North Korean state-funded hackers known as the Lazarus Group. Pertsev knowingly facilitated this kind of activity through the software he developed, she argued, and did nothing to prevent it. He had to be held accountable.And as it would soon turn out, it wasn’t just the Dutch prosecutor who held this belief. About a year after Pertsev’s arrest in the Netherlands, his PepperSec co-founders Storm and Semenov were indicted in the United States, with the former (who resided in the US) arrested. (Semenov does not live in the United States; at the time of writing this article his whereabouts are unknown, but he is likely in a country without an extradition treaty with the US.)Much like Pertsev, both of them are charged with money laundering, as well as running an unlicensed money transmitter business and sanctions violations. Storm will stand trial in New York this September.Chilling EffectThe various arrests quickly appeared to have a chilling effect on other Bitcoin developers.Even before Pertsev’s arrest, Bitcoin privacy wallet Wasabi Wallet—Samourai Wallet’s main competitor—in March of 2022 decided to implement AML checks in their mixing software, and reject coins that were suspected to have been used for illicit activity. (Although Wasabi Wallet, like Tornado Cash and Samourai Wallet, was fully non-custodial, the company behind the wallet—zkSNACKs—coordinated CoinJoin mixes through a central server.)This new policy was harshly criticized by—among others—the Samourai Wallet team and other privacy focused bitcoiners. Rodriguez and Hill loudly and proudly proclaimed that their mixing service was open for business to anyone, and on social media adopted a much more adversarial attitude towards regulators and their KYC/AML regime. Indeed, it was exactly this attitude that may have gotten them in legal trouble.More recently, the Samourai Wallet arrests moved other Bitcoin developers to take additional precautions as well. Just one day after the indictment, Sparrow Wallet, which had been compatible with Samourai Wallet’s Whirlpool, for example released a new version of its software that disabled this feature. Shortly after, development company ACINQ announced that its Phoenix Wallet (a Lightning wallet) would be removed from US app stores, citing on Twitter that “[r]ecent announcements from US authorities cast a doubt on whether self-custodial wallet providers, Lightning service providers, or even Lightning nodes could be considered Money Services Businesses and be regulated as such.”And in what was arguably the biggest setback for privacy in Bitcoin’s short history, Wasabi Wallet soon after announced to discontinue its mixing service altogether. With Whirlpool already down, the other major CoinJoin coordinator would seize operations per June 1st of this year.The First VerdictJust weeks after the Samourai Wallet developers’ arrest and the events that unfolded immediately after, on May 14th of this year, it was time for Pertsev’s sentencing.In the courthouse of ’s Hertogenbosch, a small city about an hour south of Amsterdam, the Tornado Cash developer received the bad news. The panel of judges essentially agreed with the prosecutor on all counts, and in some ways went even further than the prosecutor was willing to go. The judges ruled that Pertsev was fully responsible for how the smart contract was used; the fact that some of the code that PepperSec produced was “unstoppable”, was not considered a valid excuse.“Tornado Cash functions in the way the defendant and its co-founders developed Tornado Cash,” they stated. “So the operation is completely their responsibility.”Pertsev was sentenced to 64 months in Dutch prison— though he did file for appeal, which at the time of writing is pending.The next Tornado Cash court case will take place in New York, where Pertsev’s PepperSec co-founder Storm will stand trial. While the Dutch verdict should technically not affect the outcome of the American proceedings, the case and sentencing in the Netherlands might offer an indication of what can be expected: the Dutch prosecutors shared many of their files with their American colleagues.Meanwhile, the first hearing for Samourai Wallet’s Rodriguez took place in New York last May as well. He will be awaiting the full trial on home arrest in Pennsylvania.Still, despite these significant setbacks for Bitcoin privacy, the prospects of bitcoin mixing are not altogether dead. Most obviously, all American trials are yet to take place. (And even if Rodriguez, Hill and/or Storm are found guilty, they, too, can appeal to higher courts.) Meanwhile, JoinMarket—a tool that lets users create CoinJoin transactions without a central coordinator—continues operations uninterrupted. And while Wasabi Wallet has taken its central coordinator offline, the wallet itself will still be maintained.What’s more, alternative Wasabi Wallet coordinators have already started offering their services: while not operated by zkSNACKs, this enables users of the wallet to create CoinJoin transactions between them in much the same way. Because such coordinators can even be operated anonymously over Tor, future prosecution of such services may be even harder as well— regardless of the outcome of the upcoming trials.The fighting stage, indeed, has begun— and the fight is far from over. Whether the adage will ring true, and the winning stage follows next, remains to be seen."
Bitcoin Magazine,The Impact of Institutional Investors on Bitcoin,"Fri, 30 Aug 2024 15:45:09 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-impact-of-institutional-investors-on-bitcoin,The Institutional Paradox: How Big Money is Reshaping Bitcoin’s Future,"For years, Bitcoin enthusiasts have been expecting a significant change in the value due to the involvement of institutional investors. The concept was simple: as companies and large financial entities invest in Bitcoin, the market would experience explosive growth and a sustained period of rising prices. However, the actual outcome has been more complex. Although institutions have indeed invested substantial capital in Bitcoin, the anticipated ‘supercycle’ has not unfolded as predicted.Institutional AccumulationInstitutional participation in Bitcoin has significantly increased in recent years, marked by substantial purchases from large companies and the introduction of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) earlier this year.

Leading this movement is MicroStrategy, which alone holds over 1% of the total Bitcoin supply. Following MicroStrategy, other prominent players include Marathon Digital, Galaxy Digital, and even Tesla, with significant holdings also found in Canadian firms such as Hut 8 and Hive, as well as international companies like Nexon in Japan and Phoenix Digital Assets in the UK; all of which can be tracked via the new Treasury data charts available on site.

Figure 2: Detailed analysis of BTC treasuries for publicly traded companies. Access Live Chart 🔍

In total, these companies hold over 340,000 bitcoin. However, the real game-changer has been the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs. Since their inception, these financial instruments have attracted billions of dollars in investments, resulting in the accumulation of over 91,000 bitcoin in just a few months. Together, private companies and ETFs control around 1.24 million bitcoin, representing about 6.29% of all circulating bitcoin.A Look at Bitcoin's Recent Price MovementsTo understand the potential future impact of institutional investment, we can look at recent Bitcoin price movements since the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January. At the time, Bitcoin was trading at around $46,000. Although the price dipped shortly after, a classic ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" scenario, the market quickly recovered, and within two months, Bitcoin's price had surged by approximately 60%.

Figure 3: Bitcoin price action following the ETF approvals. Access Live Chart 🔍

This increase correlates with institutional investors' accumulation of Bitcoin through ETFs. If this pattern continues and institutions keep buying at the current or increased pace, we could witness a sustained bullish momentum in Bitcoin prices. The key factor here is the assumption that these institutional players are long-term holders, unlikely to sell off their assets anytime soon. This ongoing accumulation would reduce the liquid supply of Bitcoin, requiring less capital inflow to drive prices even higher.The Money Multiplier Effect: Amplifying the ImpactThe accumulation of assets by institutional players is significant. Its potential impact on the market is even more profound when you consider the money multiplier effect. The principle is straightforward: when a large portion of an asset's supply is removed from active circulation, such as the nearly 75% of supply that hasn’t moved in at least six months as outlined by the HODL Waves, the price of the remaining circulating supply can be more volatile. Each dollar invested has a magnified impact on the overall market cap.

Figure 4: Bitcoin HODL waves outlining the illiquidity of BTC. Access Live Chart 🔍

For Bitcoin, with roughly 25% of its supply being liquid and actively traded, the money multiplier effect can be particularly potent. If we assume this illiquidity results in a $1 market inflow increase in the market cap by $4 (4x money multiplier), institutional ownership of 6.29% of all bitcoin could effectively influence around 25% of the circulating supply.If institutions were to begin offloading their holdings, the market would likely experience a significant downturn. Especially as this would likely trigger retail holders to begin offloading their bitcoin too. Conversely, if these institutions continue to buy, the BTC price could surge dramatically, particularly if they maintain their positions as long-term holders. This dynamic underscores the double-edged nature of institutional involvement in Bitcoin, as it slowly then suddenly possesses a greater influence on the asset.ConclusionInstitutional investment in Bitcoin has both positive and negative aspects. It brings legitimacy and capital that could drive Bitcoin prices to new heights, especially if these entities are committed long term. However, the concentration of Bitcoin in the hands of a few institutions could lead to heightened volatility and significant downside risk if these players decide to exit their positions.For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out a recent YouTube video here:"
Bitcoin Magazine,BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Saw Outflow For the First Time Since May,"Fri, 30 Aug 2024 10:50:34 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-saw-outflow-for-the-first-time-since-may,"BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, saw an outflow of $13.5 million on Thursday, marking the first withdrawal since May 1st amid a third straight day of outflows from Bitcoin ETFs.","BlackRock's spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the iShares Bitcoin Trust, experienced an outflow of $13.5 million on Thursday. This was IBIT's first outflow since May 1st. Thursday's outflow was the second ever for the iShares Bitcoin Trust since its launch in January. The ETF has seen consistent inflows almost daily, cementing itself as a dominant Bitcoin investment product.Prior to Thursday's $13.5 million outflow, the last time the fund saw withdrawals was May 1st when $37 million was pulled out. That coincided with Bitcoin hitting a local low of $56,000.The outflow comes as spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a third straight day of withdrawals totalling $71.8 million on Thursday. Competing Bitcoin ETFs from Grayscale, Fidelity, Valkyrie and Bitwise also posted outflows ranging from $8 million to $31 million.Meanwhile, ARK's Bitcoin ETF saw an inflow of $5.3 million, bucking the negative trend. The mixed flows highlight diverse investor outlooks amid Bitcoin's stagnation under $60,000. BlackRock's IBIT seeing an outflow for the first time in months is a notable development. It might indicate that the bottom is in like the last time, or this might be the start of more outflows. Nonetheless, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF has still attracted a staggering over $20 billion in net inflows over its lifetime. It remains the dominant spot Bitcoin fund with over 350,000 BTC under management, making it one of the largest institutional Bitcoin holders."

Bitcoin mining is the process through which new bitcoins are introduced into circulation. It typically involves using powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems, which verify and add transactions to the blockchain. In return, miners are rewarded with newly minted bitcoins, known as the block subsidy, along with transaction fees paid by users.The miner’s accomplishment is significant, given the increasingly competitive landscape of Bitcoin mining, where large mining pools usually dominate. Solo miners face the challenge of competing against large, resource-rich mining pools; however, although rare, the rewards can be substantial, as demonstrated by this and many previous solo miners' successes.""Congratulations to miner 36AisvWi1UiwLTeTZxLzindAkorqeUc3tT for solving the 291st solo block on solo.ckpool.org!"" said Solo CK administrator, Dr. Con Kolivas.

Bitcoin culture –– if such a homogenous thing still exists –– is wrapped up in another culture war distraction while the regulatory moat fills with legislation preventing self custody while penal system reptiles surface to toss those who dared to write code in the pen. We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence. It is to their advantage to speak of us, and we should expect that they will speak.How did we get here? How have we spent the last year arguing about what constitutes spam, and ethical use of Bitcoin, while completely ignoring the overflowing regulatory moat? There were more than enough signs. There were more than enough warnings. Congress is putting together drafted legislation for further internet regulation, stablecoin bills, social media application bans, while the state continues to redefine in real time what a cryptocurrency even is.To try to prevent their speech is to fight against the realities of information. Information does not just want to be free, it longs to be free. Information expands to fill the available storage space. Information is Rumor's younger, stronger cousin; Information is fleeter of foot, has more eyes, knows more, and understands less than Rumor.Bitcoin is a database. Bitcoin is speech. Bitcoin is code. The compliance-driving hypnotists will tell you we must ask permission from our local governing offices for the embrace of bitcoin. So that we can pay our taxes in bitcoin and service our legal debts. Samourai, TornadoCash, Wasabi Wallet… they wrote code. Code that users across the globe, in myriad legal jurisdictions, utilized to exchange alphanumeric strings.People have been defending their own privacy for centuries with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret handshakes, and couriers. The technologies of the past did not allow for strong privacy, but electronic technologies do.Writing code is not a crime. Code is speech. Distributing code is an expression between parties of bytes, reduced to bits, to ones and zeroes. Any precedent that establishes anything other than this is in direct violation of the First Amendment, and furthermore, against the natural code of freedom of expression. Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do, we're going to write it.There are plenty of ways that Bitcoin the network can spread itself across the globe, and how bitcoin the asset can monetize to astronomical heights without bringing an ounce more freedom to the populace of the world. Bitcoin's definition has been gaslit by the hypnotists to be within the purview of the regulatory moat, and thus Bitcoin is in dire need of a redefinition. Bitcoin was never about dollar denominated value, it was never about perpetuating the UST market via Treasury-backed tokens utilized by captured, KYC-demanding on- and off-ramps. Bitcoin was never about embracing the state and the furthering of the reach and influence of the psychopathic criminals obsessed with changing the definition of speech and expression, of code and of numbers. Bitcoin is a tool of empowerment and Bitcoin is for enemies. Well, now our enemy, the state, is empowered.We know that software can't be destroyed and that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down.Writing code is not a crime. We sat and argued over culture signaling with all the class of drunken sport rivals while watching the bookkeepers take their red felt pen to change the meaning of words, slowly bringing the frogs, and their dictionaries, to a boil.Privacy only extends so far as the cooperation of one's fellows in society. We the Cypherpunks seek your questions and your concerns and hope we may engage you so that we do not deceive ourselves. We will not, however, be moved out of our course because some may disagree with our goals.Bitcoin is just a ledger.

Bitcoin Magazine,Proton Wallet Review: A Bitcoin Software Wallet That Simplifies Transactions,"Thu, 29 Aug 2024 16:00:46 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/reviews/proton-wallet-review-a-bitcoin-software-wallet-that-simplifies-transactions,"Proton’s new bitcoin wallet lets users send bitcoin as easily as sending an email, but don’t hold your breath waiting for transactions to settle.","Proton, the Swiss company behind ProtonMail and ProtonVPN, has released a beta version of the newest offering in its suite of products that help to preserve online privacy — Proton Wallet.The wallet is great for those looking to send bitcoin on-chain with relative ease, but it leaves some to be desired for more advanced users or for those who want to make smaller payments quickly and cheaply.Pros And ConsProton Wallet’s standout feature is that it allows you to send bitcoin using nothing more than a recipient’s email address, which doesn’t have to be a ProtonMail address. The non-custodial bitcoin-only wallet is also free to use and has an easy-to-navigate user interface (UI).However, it lacks in that it only allows users to make transactions on the Bitcoin base chain — not over Lightning — which can take upwards of hours to settle, and it doesn't allow users to manage their UTXOs. Plus, it’s a software wallet and cannot be disconnected from the internet like a hardware wallet, which increases the risk of the wallet’s private keys being compromised.Getting Started With Proton WalletTo use the beta version of the product, you need an invitation either from the company or another user. The wallet is currently available via web browser, as an Android app and as a TestFlight version of an Apple app and takes 5 to 10 minutes to set up and begin using.Once you’ve received an email invitation to use the wallet, you can click on the “Start using Proton Wallet” link in the invitation email to get started setting it up. (Email addresses have been blacked out below and throughout this review to preserve privacy.)

Invitation email for Proton Wallet

You’ll be taken to a “wallet setup” page where you’ll simply click a button to get started with Proton Wallet. You won’t be prompted to write down the 12-word seed phrase as you set up the wallet, which was a nice touch by Proton to help users to more simply get started using the wallet. You can write down the seed phrase later if you please, though.

Wallet setup

As you set up the wallet, Proton makes it clear that your Proton Wallet is a non-custodial Bitcoin wallet, which means that managing the wallet is your responsibility and your responsibility alone.

Warning message

The home screen of the wallet is straightforward and incredibly easy to navigate. It’s as pared down so as to include little more than the basics you need to send, receive and buy bitcoin.

Home screen

Depositing Bitcoin In Proton WalletTo begin using the wallet, you’ll first have to deposit some bitcoin. You can deposit bitcoin from another wallet you manage. To do so, you’ll need to copy the bitcoin address by clicking on the “Receive” button on the home screen and then clicking the “Copy Bitcoin address” button in the window that pops up on the right of the screen.

Receiving bitcoin

You’ll copy that address into the proper field from the wallet you're sending it from. It’s good practice to double check that the address you’ve pasted matches the address you’ve copied.

Sending bitcoin from an exchange

The bitcoin won’t appear in your Proton Wallet balance immediately. It usually takes at least a few minutes for the transactions to process, as this depends on how long it takes for block confirmations to occur. Some transactions can take much longer — upwards of hours.You can see that the funds are on their way, though, in the “Transactions” section of the home screen.

Buying Bitcoin With Proton WalletIf you don’t have any bitcoin to send to your Proton Wallet, you can also use the wallet to buy some. This process is relatively straightforward.You can click the “Buy” button on the home screen and you’ll be taken to a page that serves as an interface for crypto asset service providers Ramp and Banxa.

Selecting your location

Complete the fields for how much bitcoin you want to purchase, choose whether you want to use Banxa or Ramp and select your payment method.

Selecting your payment method

Instructions from this point vary depending on the payment method you choose.Sending Bitcoin With Proton WalletYou can send bitcoin as simply as clicking the “Send” button on the home screen and then inputting either a bitcoin address or an email address. Note that your recipient doesn’t need a ProtonMail address.I used an email address to send some bitcoin.

Sending bitcoin with an email address

Next, you’ll be taken to an “Amount” page, where you’ll input the amount of bitcoin you’d like to send, denominated either in either a fiat currency or sats.

Selecting the US dollar amount of bitcoin to send

On the “Review” page, you can leave a message for the recipient. It’s optional to do so.On this page, you’ll also be presented with the total amount of your transaction and be given the option to increase or decrease the priority of your transfer.You won’t be presented with the option to select UTXOs to spend, an option that a desktop Bitcoin wallet like Sparrow provides you with.If you’re comfortable with the amount you want to send and the fee, you can click the “Confirm and send” button.

Reviewing transaction details

If you'd like to increase or decrease the speed of your transaction, you can select a higher or lower network fee by clicking the arrow to the right in the ""Network fee"" section of the page.When you do so, a new window will pop up, allowing you to select different network fees.

ConclusionProton Wallet is a good Bitcoin wallet for beginners, especially those looking to send bitcoin with relative ease, using nothing more than an email address.The pros of this non-custodial wallet are that it’s free to use, easy to set up and secure. It’s also bitcoin only and open-source.However, one notable con of the wallet is that it only allows you to transact on the bitcoin base chain, which means your transactions may incur high fees and take over an hour to fully process. For this reason, you wouldn’t want to use Proton Wallet if you're looking to make cheap, fast micropayments — the types of transactions you can make over Lightning.Another drawback of the wallet is that it doesn’t permit you to manage UTXOs. And it’s a software wallet, which means it’s less secure than a hardware wallet in certain regards.With that said, if you’re new to Bitcoin and already familiar with the interfaces for Proton products, then this wallet may be a good option for you."
Bitcoin Magazine,Jack Dorsey-Backed Nostr Emerges as Bitcoin's Social Layer at Riga Conference,"Thu, 29 Aug 2024 15:38:36 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/jack-dorsey-backed-nostr-emerges-as-bitcoins-social-layer-at-riga-conference-,NostrWorld's Nostriga event highlighted strong synergies between Bitcoin and the nascent social protocol.,"The third edition of NostrWorld's unconference series took place last week in the picturesque city of Riga, Latvia, bringing together advocates and developers of the Nostr protocol. Spearheaded by Block CEO and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, NostrWorld's free gatherings are a platform for open-source enthusiasts to exchange ideas, foster collaboration, and ignite initiatives aimed at shaping a freer, more decentralized version of the internet.Bitcoin Magazine was on the ground in Riga to explore how the evolution of the Nostr protocol could influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. While Nostr’s budding community has famously attracted prominent Bitcoin advocates, Nostriga—as this third NostrWorld conference was dubbed—offered a fresh lens on the growing synergies between these two technologies. Conversations with attendees and observations throughout the two-day event revealed a clear trend: Bitcoin’s path appears increasingly likely to intertwine with Nostr’s promising social network technology.What’s Nostr?Nostr is an open-source protocol designed to create a decentralized, censorship-resistant social network. Unlike traditional platforms that rely on centralized servers, Nostr operates on a network of relays where users can publish and receive messages. Nostr is quickly gaining traction as a social layer for Bitcoin, enabling features like micropayments and digital identity management. Beyond social media, Nostr presents an opportunity to build a new internet architecture that frees users from reliance on centralized platforms. This approach empowers individuals by removing the need for intermediaries that typically own user data, monetize attention, and control or censor access.Micropayments Market FitA standout moment of the conference came when Strike CEO Jack Mallers shared a personal story about an acquaintance he had been trying to convince of Bitcoin’s potential for years. It wasn’t until she got onboarded onto Nostr and received Zaps to her account that the power of the technology finally clicked for her.Zaps are small Bitcoin payments, often sent as tips or rewards on Nostr, allowing users to support content creators directly through the Lightning Network. This micro-payment feature has become a popular way to demonstrate Bitcoin's utility and value in a social contextThe concept of micropayments predates even Bitcoin, but Nostr advocates believe Zaps represent the first successful large-scale implementation of the idea. On a panel alongside Primal CEO Miljan Braticevic, Jack Mallers emphasized the significance of this achievement:""I think that's very underappreciated. Something that has been desired on the web for many decades. From anonymous cypherpunks to the most powerful people in the world, all have desired this use case and we seem to have achieved that.”Micropayments through Nostr introduce a new bootstrapping mechanism that could reshape the traditional Bitcoin onboarding process. Individuals who might not be swayed by Bitcoin’s economic or political narrative might appreciate its unique value once exposed to casual internet tipping and microtransactions. This shift opens Bitcoin up to a broader audience by making it accessible in everyday social interactions already familiar to internet users.Setting the stage for the Ecash economyEcash, one of Bitcoin’s up-and-coming technologies was a recurring theme throughout the event. Cashu protocol developer CalleBTC made a passionate argument for the central role Nostr could play in an ecash-driven economy.Proposed as a system for private, scalable payments using blind signatures, ecash enables users to transact without revealing their identities, preserving financial privacy. However, this privacy comes with a tradeoff: ecash introduces trusted entities known as mints, which custody users' Bitcoin deposits in exchange for tokens, often referred to as notes. For ecash to function effectively, a robust market of mints is necessary to provide users with options for whom to trust. As the concept gains traction, this reliance on multiple mints introduces various coordination and discovery challenges—challenges developers believe are ideally suited to be addressed by Nostr’s social features.Examples of this are bitcoinmints.com and cashumints.space, two Nostr-based websites that offer a Yelp-like interfaces for users to discover new mint providers and for mints to advertise their services and build a reputation. Although the initial implementations are fairly basic, the potential integration of Nostr’s social graph could enable users to make informed decisions about which mints to trust. By leveraging connections within their network and trusted reviews from friends, users could more confidently choose mints based on the relationships and experiences shared by those they know. Eventually, the expectation is that similar Nostr-based services will be integrated directly into Bitcoin ecash wallets, offering users a seamless onboarding experience that avoids imposing trusted defaults. Similarly, Nostr’s infrastructure provides various methods to bolster the resilience of ecash mints, enabling future implementations to operate independently of the internet’s centralized DNS services. This would allow users to establish direct connections with mints, reducing their exposure to third-party interventions and enhancing the overall security and decentralization of the ecash system.Another fascinating concept emerging from the convergence of ecash and Nostr communities is the idea known as “nutsack.” Introduced by Nostr developer PabloF7z, Nutsack, or NIP-60, allows users to store ecash notes on Nostr relays, effectively distributing them across the network and tying them to the user’s identity. In effect, the scheme allows universal access to a user's ecash balance across any Nostr client that supports the feature. This means that, in the future, users could log into any website or online service and have their ecash balance seamlessly follow them, enabling effortless spending across multiple platforms.Communities and Web-Of-TrustOne of the biggest opportunities—and perhaps the most significant challenge—for Nostr is its ability to reach new internet communities beyond the Bitcoin-centric groups that currently dominate the platform. Announcements like developer Alex Gleason’s Ditto, made last week, have the potential to extend Nostr's reach into the broader landscape of existing internet communities, such as Mastodon, paving the way for wider adoption.“With Ditto people find websites they want to join because of a community and then they discover Nostr as a side effect, which gives them the opportunity to learn what it is and why it matters,” explained Gleason in his presentation. This amplification of Nostr’s network effect could have significant implications for Bitcoin adoption. With features like Zaps, Nostr offers a unique opportunity to introduce non-technical users to the power of an internet-native currency, making Bitcoin more accessible and relatable in everyday digital interactions.“Bitcoin is revolutionary and I believe it is key to Nostr’s success but social media needs communities.”Looking ahead, the formation of communities and the adoption of Nostr as an identity system could pave the way for digital economies rooted in the web-of-trust concept. By building social graphs based on cryptographically signed messages, users can carry their reputation across the internet, laying the groundwork for secure, decentralized commerce that operates independently of traditional laws, contracts, and enforcement mechanisms— with Bitcoin at the center of it all."
Bitcoin Magazine,The New Mission Critical Facilities: Bitcoin Mining Farms,"Thu, 29 Aug 2024 13:51:09 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-new-mission-critical-facilities-bitcoin-mining-farms,A look at the operational dynamics and needs of data centers as it relates to Bitcoin mining.,"Life embodies evolution, change, adaptation, and the willingness to thrive. Throughout history, we have experienced numerous changes that have forced society to evolve, adapt, and grow. From the inception of trading to the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, we have witnessed events that have transformed the world. One of the most important and influential sectors in the world is finance. The world of finance has been shaped by pivotal events that have impacted economies, influenced policies, and altered the course of global markets. One of the most exceptional developments in the past 15 years is the invention of Bitcoin and the emergence of the crypto industry. The crypto industry, while not yet accessible to everyone, has witnessed remarkable growth and evolution since Bitcoin's launch in 2009. In the following years, the industry became a dynamic and influential force, drawing the attention of investors and enthusiasts worldwide. In this article, I will share my opinion on why crypto will become a very stable market, potentially replacing current financial or banking methods. This discussion will touch on key topics such as safety, circular economy, and sustainability, which combined with current high potential businesses like Data Centers, will shape the new future. Crypto Infrastructure and Energy Consumption The servers supporting the cryptocurrency infrastructure are primarily used for cryptocurrency mining, transaction verification, smart contract execution, and decentralized applications (DApps) hosting. These servers typically possess the following specifications: • High-performance CPUs and GPUs • Large memory and storage capacity • Advanced networking capabilities • Robust security features These characteristics translate into expensive, high-power consumption servers. Therefore, we need a robust and reliable space to store these servers and ensure they function as expected. Energy Consumption Data transmission currently consumes nearly 3% of the total electricity used worldwide. To ensure data is not only transmitted correctly but also stored and processed properly, we rely on physical spaces known as data centers. These data centers are considered mission-critical facilities. But why are data centers deemed mission-critical? Mission-critical facilities are broadly defined as operations that, if interrupted, would negatively impact business activities, ranging from revenue loss and legal non-compliance to, in extreme cases, loss of life. Data centers, hospitals, laboratories, and military installations are just a few examples of such facilities. Data center facilities are highly regulated by various organizations and standards for both physical and data infrastructure. This stringent regulation is crucial because data loss can result in massive consequences for millions of people, given the sensitivity of the stored information. Gradually, the blockchain industry along with emerging markets like AI (Artificial Intelligence) is playing an increasingly significant role in the modern world. The demand for distributed facilities to store nodes that validate crypto transactions and execute smart contracts is rising significantly. Are current Data Centers ready for Blockchain technology? Blockchain presents challenges not only for Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP) infrastructure but also for enterprise infrastructure. To accommodate the demanding workloads associated with blockchain technology, facilities will need to enhance both infrastructure security and MEP capabilities. Currently, the average power density in a data center is around 10 kW per rack. For context, according to several reports, the average power consumed by a home in the United States that uses electricity for heating and hot water is approximately 10,715 kWh per year. A single rack in a data center, by comparison, consumes nearly 9 times more power per year (8,760 kWh per year), with some facilities designed to provide peak power above 100 MW. Constructing these facilities requires significant investment, and sometimes the efficiency of the facility is not as desired, leading to higher costs for data management. One issue with current data centers is partial loads, meaning that if the facility consumes determined amount of Watts, the original design was for 1.5 times those Watts. This results in lower performance and efficiency. The closer the facility's consumption is to its designed energy consumption, the easier it is to improve and control overall efficiency. The key difference between blockchain and traditional data computation is decentralization. In a decentralized system, the failure of a single node does not impact the performance of the entire digital infrastructure, whereas in traditional systems, a node failure can cause significant and irreversible damage to many businesses. This necessity for high reliability and redundancy explains why data centers typically have high initial costs (CAPEX), with multiple layers of security to ensure continued operation even in the event of equipment failure. However, the decentralization inherent in blockchain technology offers a distinct advantage: it reduces the need for expensive and redundant facilities to accommodate all crypto servers, as the failure of some nodes does not disrupt the entire system. This raises an important question: what is the solution to integrating traditional data transmission methods with new blockchain technology? Combining current needs with new Crypto needs In the data center industry, the terminology of ""Tiers"" as defined by the Uptime Institute is widely used and accepted globally. This classification system is similar to the levels of redundancy specified by TIA or BICSI standards. While those familiar with the data center market are well-versed in these Tiers, here is an explanation for crypto users who may be new to this terminology: There are four Tiers, each representing a different level of redundancy in a facility: 1. Tier I: No redundancy. 2. Tier II: Redundancy. 3. Tier III: Concurrently maintainable. 4. Tier IV: Fault-tolerant. These Tiers also correlate with the initial investment required to create the facility. Moving from one Tier to the next typically involves doubling the capital expenditure (CAPEX). Most data centers are ranked as Tier III, indicating they are designed to be concurrently maintainable. This ensures the facility can be kept in optimal condition to prevent failures at any time. It is crucial to note that some IT equipment hosted in a data center is essential for the daily operations of our lives; even traffic lights rely on these services. For blockchain infrastructure, there is no need to significantly increase CAPEX to ensure the proper operation of the equipment. It is essential to accommodate the servers in an environment where they function correctly with minimal downtime. Since the loss of individual servers does not affect the functionality of the entire blockchain, these operations do not require high availability. Although downtime can affect users earning revenue from transaction validation, it is crucial to evaluate whether the cost of reducing downtime justifies the increased CAPEX.Therefore, the Tier level of these facilities can be reduced. In some areas of the data center that are not critical to powering the crypto nodes, the Tier can be lowered to Tier II or even Tier I. This approach optimizes resources without compromising the overall blockchain infrastructure. Crypto Mining as a Single Business? To support our previous discussions and to foster new ones, consider the following data: Following the Bitcoin halving on April 20, 2024, the return on investment (ROI) per miner has decreased by 50%, irrespective of variations in total hashrate or Bitcoin price. This reduction tightens the overall financial outlook. For instance, a miner costing $2,000, producing 120 TH/s, and requiring no additional capital expenditures (CAPEX) beyond the miner itself, now faces this ROI decrease. For an installation comprising 100 miners, the total CAPEX investment for the entire facility (including land for one container, MEP infrastructure, and miners) is estimated at around $503,000. The following analysis illustrates the approximate ROI over the next four years (until the next halving) for a facility operating 100 miners, each consuming 3.3 kW and with a price per kilowatt hour equal to 0.08$. To try to make it more accurate, this analysis assumes the hashrate increases by 50% annually, and uses traditional air cooling solutions. The projected future Bitcoin price used in this analysis is $250,000, based on various studies and speculations. 


The projected ROI over the next four years, considering a future Bitcoin price of $300,000, shows that crypto mining alone might not be a highly profitable business. This raises the question of why companies continue to invest in crypto mining. The answer is speculation. In bullish times, crypto facilities were highly profitable, but now these facilities need additional revenue streams.Heat Reuse: A Disruptive Side Hustle One innovative side hustle is converting these facilities into heating power facilities. Most power consumed by miners/servers is converted into heat. What if we could capture that heat and sell it as energy? For example, selling this energy to a nearby farm for greenhouses at $0.03/kWh makes the business model more viable. Considering a supposed extra investment of $750,000 (please bear in mind that the extra investment has to be calculated according to facility limitations and in this case a ball park number was taken into account for the exercise). 


Upon initial analysis, the business model appears to be viable. The integration of a heat reuse side business has effectively doubled the return on investment (ROI). It is important to note that the ROI calculation is based on a four-year period, coinciding with the next Bitcoin halving event. While the facilities may no longer be optimal for the same cryptocurrency operations post-halving, the infrastructure will remain valuable for selling the generated heat.Moreover, if we consider combining this model with the data center market, the ROI extends beyond the next four years. This represents a long-term investment where the efficient use of electricity could become increasingly significant. Conclusion The crypto industry is gaining more importance in our lives. Several companies are adding stablecoins to their portfolios as financial assets, and new technologies are emerging on the blockchain that will require specialized facilities like current data centers (like BlockDAG architecture, Ordinals/NFTs, BRC20 and, most importantly, Runes). We are at the beginning of a market that will stay and change the current scenario. Combining legacy data centers with crypto-specific areas to facilitate additional businesses like heat reuse is likely just a matter of time, a run to become sustainable. Those who lead this transformation will be the ones to benefit the most.This is a guest post by Jose Farrona.

In very few words they can announce a half-truth; and in order to demonstrate that it is incomplete, we are obliged to have recourse to long and dry dissertations.” — Frédéric Bastiat, Economic Sophisms, First Series (1845)“The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it.” — Williamson (2016) on Brandolini’s LawFor too long, the world has had to endure the fallout of subpar academic research on bitcoin mining’s energy use and environmental impact. The outcome of this bullshit research has been shocking news headlines that have turned some well-meaning people into angry politicians and deranged activists. So that you never have to endure the brutality of one of these sloppy papers, I’ve sacrificed my soul to the bitcoin mining gods and performed a full-scale analysis of a study from the United Nations University, published recently in the American Geophysical Union’s Earth’s Future. Only the bravest and hardest of all bitcoin autists may proceed to the following paragraphs, the rest of you can go back to watching the price chart.Your soft baby ears might have screamed with shock at the strong proclamation in my lede that the biggest and squeakiest research on bitcoin mining is bullshit. If you’ve ever read Jonathan Koomey’s 2018 blog post on the Digiconomist–also known as Alex deVries, or his 2019 Coincenter report, or Lei et al. 2021, or Sai and Vranken 2023, or Masanet et al. 2021, or… Well, the point is that there’s thousands of words already written that have shown that bitcoin mining energy modeling is in a state of crisis and that this is not isolated to bitcoin! It’s a struggle that data center energy studies have faced for decades. People like Jonathan Koomey, Eric Masanet, Arman Shehabi, and those nice guys Sai and Vranken (sorry, we’re not yet on a first-name basis) have written enough pages that could probably cover the walls of at least one men’s bathroom at every bitcoin conference that’s happened last year, that show this to be true.My holy altar, which I keep in my bedroom closet, is a hand-carved, elegant yet ascetic shrine to Koomey, Masanet, and Shehabi for the decades of work they’ve done to improve data center energy modeling. These sifus of computing have made it all very clear to me: if you don’t have bottom-up data and you rely on historical trends while ignoring IT device energy efficiency trends and what drives demand, then your research is bullshit. And so, with one broad yet very surgical stroke, I swipe left on Mora et al. (2018), deVries (2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023), Stoll et al. (2019), Gallersdorfer et al. (2020), Chamanara et al. (2023), and all the others that are mentioned in Sai and Vranken’s comprehensive review of the literature. World, let these burn in one violent yet metaphorically majestic mega-fire somewhere off the coast of the Pacific Northwest. Reporters, and policymakers, please, I implore you to stop listening to Earthjustice, Sierra Club, and Greenpeace for they know not what they do. Absolve them of their sins, for they are but sheep. Amen.Now that I’ve set the mood for you, my pious reader, I will now tell you a story about a recent bitcoin energy study. I pray to the bitcoin gods that this will be the last one I ever write, and the last one you’ll ever need to read, but my feeling is that the gods are punishing gods and will not have mercy on my soul–even in a bull market. One deep breath (cue Heath Ledger’s Joker) and Here… We… Go.On a somewhat bearish October afternoon, I got tagged on Twitter/X on a post about a new bitcoin energy use study from some authors affiliated with the United Nations University (Chamanara et al., 2023). Little did I know that this study would trigger my autism so hard that I would descend into my own kind of drug-induced-gonzo-fear-and-loathing-in-vegas state, and hyper-focus on this study for the next four weeks. While I am probably exaggerating about the heavy drug use, my recollection of this time is very much a techno-colored, toxic relationship-level fever dream. Do you remember Frank from the critically acclaimed 2001 film, Donnie Darko? Yeah, he was there, too.As I started taking notes on the paper, I realized that Chamanara et al.’s study was really confusing. The paper was perplexing because it's a poorly designed study that bases its raison d’etre entirely on de Vries and Mora et al. It uses the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance (CCAF) Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index (CBECI) data without acknowledging the limitations of the model (see Lei et al. 2021 and Sai and Vranken 2023 for an in-depth analysis of the issues with CBECI’s modeling). It conflates its results from the 2020-2021 period with the state of bitcoin mining in 2022 and 2023. The authors also relied on some environmental footprint methodology that would make you think it was actually possible for you to shrink or grow a reservoir depending on how hard you Netflix and chill. Really, this is what Obringer et al. (2020) inferentially conclude is possible and the UN study cites Obringer as one of its methodological foundations. By the way, Koomey and Masanet did not like Obringer et al.’s methodology, either. I’ll light another soy-based candle at the altar in their honor.Here’s a more clearly stated enumeration of the crux of the problem with Chamanara et al. (and by the way, their corresponding author never responded to my email asking for their data so I could, you know, verify, not trust. 🥴):The authors conflated electricity use across multiple years, overreaching on what the results could reveal based on their methods.The authors used historical trends to make present and future recommendations despite extensive peer-reviewed literature clearly showing that this leads to overestimates and exaggerated claims.The paper promises an energy calculation that will reveal bitcoin’s true energy use and environmental impact. They use two sets of data from CBECI: i) total monthly energy consumption and ii) average hashrate share for the top ten countries where bitcoin mining is operated. Keep in mind that CBECI relies on IP addresses that are tracked at several mining pools. CBECI-affiliated mining pools represent an average of 34.8% of the total network hashrate. So, the data used likely have fairly wide uncertainty bars.After about an hour or so of Troy Cross talking me off a rather impressive, art deco and weather-worn ledge that’s probably seen a few Great Gatsby flappers jump–a result of feeling an overwhelming sense of terror after my exasperated self realized that no amount of cognitive behavioral therapy would get me through this study–I determined the equation that the authors used to calculate the energy use shares for each of the top ten countries with the most share of hashrate (based on the IP address estimates) had to be the following:


Don’t let the math scare you. Here’s an example of how this equation works. Let’s say China has a shared share for January 2020 of 75%. Then, let’s also say that the total energy consumption for January 2020 was 10 TWh (these are made-up numbers for simplicity’s sake). Then, for one month, we’d find that China used 7.5 TWh of energy. Now, save that number in your memory palace and do the same operation for February 2020. Next, add the energy use for January to the energy use found for February. Do this for each subsequent month until you’ve added up all 12 months. You now have CBECI’s China’s annual energy consumption for 2020.Before I show the table with my results, let me explain another caveat to the UN study. This study uses an older version of CBECI data. To be fair to the authors, they submitted their paper for review before CBECI updated their machine efficiency calculations. However, this means that Chamanara et al.’s results are not even close to realistic because we now believe that CBECI’s older model was overestimating energy use. Moreover, to do this comparison, I was limited to data through August 31, 2023, because CBECI switched to the new model for the rest of 2023. To get this older data, CCAF was generous and shared it with me upon request.Country2020 Energy Consumption (TWh)2021 Energy Consumption (TWh)2020 + 2021 Energy Consumption (TWh)Chamanara et al.'s 2020 + 2021 Energy Consumption (TWh)Percent Change Between 2020 + 2021 Calculations (%)Mainland China44.4532.8977.3473.485.25United States4.6525.2029.8532.89-9.24Kazakhstan3.1812.0615.2415.94-4.39Russia4.717.5912.2912.280.081Malaysia3.314.137.447.292.06Canada0.805.256.056.62-8.61Iran2.333.065.395.134.82Germany0.673.313.984.18-4.78Ireland0.622.693.313.43-3.50Singapore0.311.131.431.56-0.083Other (Excluding Singapore)3.696.7310.4210.63-1.98Total68.72104.04172.76173.42-0.38Another tricky thing about this study is that they combined the energy use for both 2020 and 2021 into one number. This was really tricky because if you look at their figures, you’ll notice that the biggest text states, “Total: 173.42 TWh”. It’s also slightly confusing because the figure caption states, “2020-2021”, which for many people would be interpreted as a period of 12 months, not 24 months. Well, whatever. I broke them up into their individual years so everyone could see the steps that were taken to get to these numbers.Look at the far right column with the header, “Percent Change Between 2020 + 2021 Calculations (%)”. I calculated the percent change between my calculations and Chamanara et al.’s. This is rather curious, isn’t it? Based on my conversations with the researchers at CCAF, the numbers should be identical. Maybe the changelog doesn’t reflect a smaller change somewhere, but our numbers are slightly different nonetheless. China has a greater share and the United States has a smaller share in the data that CCAF shared with me compared to the UN study. Despite this, the totals are fairly close. So, let’s give the authors the benefit of the doubt and say that they did a reasonable job calculating the energy share, given the limitations of the CBECI model. Please bear in mind that noting that their calculation was reasonable doesn’t mean that it’s reasonable to use these historical estimates to make claims about the present and future and direct policy. It isn’t.One evening while working by candlelight, I glanced to my left and saw Frank’s stabbing, black pupils (the Donnie Darko character I mentioned earlier) staring at me like two pieces of Stronghold waste coal, fixed in a quiet bed of pearly sand. He was reminding me that this report was still not finished and something about time travel. I grabbed my extra-soft curls (I switched to bar shampoo, it’s a godsend for frizz) and yanked as hard as I could. Willie Nelson’s 1974 Austin City Limits pilot episode blasting on my cheap-ass Chinese knock-off monitor’s mono speakers was moving through my ears like heroin through Lou Reed’s 4-lanes wide network of veins. Begrudgingly, I accepted my fate. I needed to go deeper down this rabbit hole. I needed to do a deeper analysis of the 2020 and 2021 CBECI data to show how important it is to do an annual analysis and not blur the years into one calculation. Realizing I was out of my hard liquor of choice, a splash of sherry in a Shirley Temple (shaken, not stirred), I grabbed a bottle of bootleg antiseptic that I got during the pandemic lockdown and chugged.I flipped through my notes. I have lots of notes because I’m a serious person. What about the mining map issues? Can we do this through an analysis of the two separate years? What was happening for each of the ten countries? Does that tell us anything about where hashrate went after the China ban? What about the Kazakhstan crackdown? That’s post-2021, but the UN study acts like it never happened when they’re talking about the current mining distribution…Not to the authors’ credit, they failed to mention to the peer-reviewers and to their readers that the mining map data only goes through January 2022. So, even though they talk about bitcoin mining’s energy mix as if it represents the present, they are completely wrong. Their analysis only captures historical trends, not the present and definitely not the future.


See this multi-colored plot of CBECI's estimated daily energy use (TWh) from January 2020 through August 31, 2023? At this macro scale, we see plenty of variability. But also it’s apparent just from inspection that each year is different from the next in terms of variability and energy use. There are a number of possible reasons for the cause of variability at this scale. Some possible influences on energy use could be bitcoin price, difficulty adjustment, and machine efficiency. More macroscale influences could be as a result of regulation, such as the Chinese bitcoin mining ban that occurred in 2021. Many of the Chinese miners fled the country for other parts of the world, Kazakhstan and the United States are two countries where hashrate found refuge. In fact, the power of the Texas mining scene really came to be at this unprecedented moment in hashrate history.











Look at the histograms for 2020 (top left), 2021 (top right), 2022 (bottom left), and 2023 (bottom right). It’s obvious that for each year, the estimated annualized energy consumption data shows different distributions. Even though we do see some possible distribution patterns, we have to be careful not to take this as a pattern that happens every four-year cycle. We need more data to be sure. For now, what we can say is that some years in our analysis show a bimodal distribution while other years show a kind of skewed distribution. The main point here is to show that the statistics for energy use for each of these four years are different, and distinctly so for the two years that were used in Chamanara et al.’s analysis.In the UN study, the authors wrote that bitcoin mining exceeded 100 TWh per year in 2021 and 2022. However, if we look at the histograms of the daily estimated annualized energy consumption, we can see that daily estimates vary quite a bit, and even in 2022 there were many days where the estimated energy consumption was below 100 TWh. We’re not denying that the final estimates were over 100 TWh in the older estimated data for these years. Instead, we’re showing that because bitcoin mining’s energy use is not constant from day to day or even minute-to-minute, it’s worth doing a deeper analysis to understand the origin of this variability and how it might affect energy use over time. Lastly, it’s worth noting that the updated data now estimates the annual energy use to be 89 TWh for 2021 and 95.53 TWh for 2022.One last comment, Miller et al. 2022 showed that operations (specifically buildings) with high variability in energy use over time are generally not suitable for emission studies that use averaged annual emission factors. Yet, that’s what Chamanara et al. chose to do, and what so many of these bullshit models tend to do. A good portion of bitcoin mining doesn’t operate like a constant load, Bitcoin mining can be highly flexible in response to many factors from grid stability to price to regulation. It’s about time that researchers started thinking about bitcoin mining from this understanding. Had the authors spent even a modest amount of time reading previously published literature, rather than operating in a silo like Sai and Vranken noted in their review paper, they might have at least addressed this limitation in their study.—So, I’ve never been to a honky tonk joint before. At least not until I found myself in a taxi cab with several other conferencegoers at the North American Blockchain Summit. Fort Worth, Texas, is exactly what you’d imagine. Cowboy boots, gallon-sized cowboy hats, Wrangler blue jeans, and cowboys, cowboys, cowboys everywhere you looked through the main drag. On a brisk Friday night, Fort Worth seemed frozen in time, people actually walked around at night. The stores looked like the kind of mom-and-pop shops you’d see on an episode of The Twilight Zone. I felt completely disoriented.My companions convinced me that I should learn how to two-step. Me, your standard California girl, whose physics advisor once told her that while you can take the girl out of California, you can’t take California out of the girl, should two-step?! I didn’t know a two-step from an electric slide and the only country I remember experiencing was a Garth Brooks commercial I saw once on television when I was a child. He was really popular in the nineties. That’s about as much country as this bitcoin mining researcher gets. The place was filled with kitschy gift shops and bright lights everywhere radiating from neon signs. At the center of the main room, a bartender wearing a black diamond studded belt with a white leather gun holster and lined with evenly spaced silver bullets. Who the hell knows what kind of gun he was packing, but it did remind me of the guns in the 1986 film, Three Amigos.It was here, against the backdrop of what sounded like a country band that wasn’t entirely sure that it was country, that I watched the Texas Blockchain Council’s Lee Bratcher address a ball with the kind of trigonometric grace that you could only find at the end of a cue and land that billiard in a tattered, leather pocket for what seemed like the hundredth time that night. The smooth clank of billiard against billiard awoke something inside me. I realized that I was not yet out of the rabbit hole that Frank sent me down. I remembered somewhere scribbled in my notes that I had not plotted the hashrate share over time for the countries mentioned in the UN study. So, at half past three in the morning, I threw my head back to take a swig of some club soda and bumped it against the wall of the photo booth where nuclear families could pose with a mechanical bull, and fell unconscious.Three hours later, I was back in my hotel room. Thankfully, someone placed some worthless fiat in my hand, loaded me into a cab, and had the driver take me back to the non-smoking room I checked into at the very center of the decay of twenty-first-century business travel, the Marriott Hotel. Fuzzy-brained and bleary-eyed, I let the blinding, dangerously blue light from my computer screen wash over my tired face and increase my chances of developing macular degeneration. I continued my analysis.


What follows are a series of plots of CBECI mining map data from January 2020 through January 2022. Unsurprisingly, Chamanara et al. focus attention on China’s contribution to energy use, and subsequently to its associated environmental footprint. China’s monthly hashrate peaked at over 70 percent of the network’s total hashrate in 2020. In July 2021, that hashrate share crashed to zero until it recovered to about 20 percent of the share at the end of 2021. We don’t know where it stands today, but industry insiders tell me it’s likely still hovering around this number, which means that in absolute terms, the hashrate is still growing there despite the ban.


Russia, also unsurprisingly, gets discussed as well. Yet, based on the CBECI mining map data from January 2020 through January 2022, it’s hard to argue that Russia was an immediate off-taker of exiled hashrate. There’s certainly an immediate spike, but is this real or just miners using VPN to hide their mining operation? By the end of 2021, the Russian hashrate declined to below 5 percent of the hashrate and in absolute terms, declined from a brief peak of over 13 EH/s to a bit over 8 EH/s. When looking at the total year’s worth of CBECI estimated energy use for Russia, we do see that Russia did hold a significant portion of hashrate, it’s just not clear that when working with such a limited set of data, we can make any reasonable claims about the present contribution to hashrate and environment footprint for the network.


The most controversial discussion in Chamanara et al. deals with Kazakhstan’s share of energy use and environmental footprint. Obviously, the CBECI mining map data shows that there was a significant increase in hashrate share both in relative and absolute terms. It also appears that this trend started before the China ban was implemented, but certainly appears to rapidly increase just before and after the ban was implemented. However, we do see a sharp decline from December 2021 to January 2022. Was this an early signal that the government crackdown was coming in Kazakhstan?In their analysis, Chamanara et al. ignored the recent Kazakhstan crackdown, where the government imposed an energy tax and mining licenses on the industry, effectively pushing hashrate out of the country. The authors overemphasized Kazakhstan as a current major contributor to bitcoin’s energy use and thus environmental footprint. If the authors had stayed within the limits of their methods and results, then noting the contribution of Kazakhstan’s hashrate share to the environmental footprint for the combined years of 2020 and 2021 would have been reasonable. Instead, not only do they ignore the government crackdown in 2022, but they also claim that Kazakhstan's hashrate share increased by 34% based on 2023 CBECI numbers. CBECI’s data has not been updated since January 2022 and CCAF researchers are currently waiting for data from the mining pools that will allow them to update the mining map.


I know I’ve shown you, my faithful reader, a lot of data, but go ahead and have another shot of the hardest liquor you have in your cabinet, and let’s take a look at one more figure. This one represents the United States hashrate share in the older CBECI mining map data. The trend we see for the United States is also similar for Canada, Singapore, and what CBECI Calls “Other countries”, which represent the countries that did not make the top ten list for hashrate share. There’s a clear signal that reflects what we know to be true. The United States took a significant portion of Chinese hashrate and this hashrate share grew rapidly in 2021. While we know that the CBECI mining map data is limited to less than a majority of the network hashrate, I do think that their share is at least somewhat representative of the network’s geographic distribution. Hashrate geographic distribution seems to be heavily shaped by macro trends. While electricity prices matter, government stability and friendly laws play an important role. Chamanara et al. should have done this kind of analysis to help inform their discussion. If they had, they might have realized that the network is responding to external pressures at varying times and geographic scales. We need more data before we can make strong policy recommendations when it comes to the effects of bitcoin’s energy use.—At this point, I was no longer sure if I was a bitcoin researcher or an NPC, lost in a game where the only points tallied were for the intensity of self-loathing I was feeling for agreeing to this undertaking. At the same time, I could smell the end of this analysis was near and that, with enough somatic therapy and EMDR, I might actually remember who I used to be before I got dragged into this mess. Just two days prior, Frank and I had a falling out over whether Courier New was still the best font for displaying mathematical equations. I was alone in this rabbit hole now. I dug my fingers into the dirt walls surrounding me and slowly clawed my way back to sanity.Upon exiting the hole, I grabbed my laptop and decided it was time to address the study’s environmental footprint methodology, wrap up this puppy, and put a bow on it. Chamanara et al. claimed that they followed the methods used by Ristic et al. (2019) and Obringer et al. (2020). There are a few reasons why their environmental footprint approach is flawed. First, the footprint factors are typically used for assessing the environmental footprint of energy generation. In Ristic et al., the authors developed a metric called the Relative Aggregated Factor that incorporated these factors. This metric allowed them to evaluate the placement of new electricity generators like nuclear or offshore wind. The idea behind this approach was to be mindful that while carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels were the main driver for developing energy transition goals, we should also avoid replacing fossil fuel generation with generation that could create environmental problems in different ways.Second, Obringer et al. used many of the factors listed in Ristic et al. and combined them with network transmission factors from Aslan et al. (2018). This was a bad move because Koomey is a co-author on this paper, so it shouldn’t be surprising that in 2021, Koomey co-authored a commentary alongside Masanet where they called out Obringer et al. In Koomey and Masanet, 2021, the authors chided the assumption that short-term changes in demand would lead to immediate and proportional changes in electricity use. This critique could also be applied to Chamanara et al., which looked at a period when bitcoin was experiencing a run-up to an all-time high in price during a unique economic environment (low interest rates, COVID stimulus checks, and lockdowns). Koomey and Masanet made it clear in their commentary that ignoring the non-proportionality between energy and data flows in network equipment can yield inflated environmental-impact results.More importantly, we have yet to characterize what this relationship looks like for bitcoin mining. Demand for traditional data centers is defined by the number of compute instances needed. What is the equivalent for bitcoin mining when we know that the block size is unchanging and the block pace is adjusted every two weeks to keep an average 10-minute spacing between each block? This deserves more attention.Either way, Chamanara et al. did not seem to be aware of the criticisms of Obringer et al.’s approach. This is really problematic because as mentioned at the start of this screed, Koomey and Masanet laid the groundwork for data center energy research. They should have known not to apply these methods to bitcoin mining because while the industry has differences from a traditional data center, it’s still a type of data center. There’s a lot that bitcoin mining researchers can take from the torrent of data center literature. It’s disappointing and exhausting to see papers published that ignore this reality.What more can I say other than this shit has to stop. Brandolini’s Law is real. The bullshit asymmetry is real. I really want this new halving cycle to be the one where I no longer have to address bad research. While I was writing this report, Alex de Vries published a new bullshit paper on bitcoin mining’s “water footprint”. I haven’t read it yet. I’m not sure that I will. But if I do, I promise that I will not write over 10,000 words on it. I’ve stated my case and made my peace with this genre of academic publishing. It was a fun ride, but I think it’s time to practice some self-care, treat myself to several evenings of healthy binge-watching, and dream of the ineffable.—If you enjoyed this article, please visit btcpolicy.org where you can read the full 10,000-word technical analysis of the Chamanara et al.

Bitcoin Magazine,The Other Satoshis: Bitcoin's Most Important Early Contributors,"Wed, 28 Aug 2024 18:38:10 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/the-other-satoshis-bitcoins-most-important-early-contributors,"Early in Bitcoin’s history, many contributors helped the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto shape the technology we all know today. A review of their legacies, from ""The Halving Issue"".","This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine’s “The Halving Issue”. Click here to get your copy.If, in 2021, the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains a mystery, so too does the two-year period from 2008 to 2010 when Bitcoin’s creator served as the project’s principal developer and leader. Yet, far from a lifeless period of project development, during those years Nakamoto worked with dozens if not hundreds of Bitcoin users, all of whom contributed to the effort in different ways, establishing websites, engaging in commerce and evangelizing for his invention. Still, some users naturally emerged as more distinguished contributors. Whether it was by helping establish core elements of the Bitcoin philosophy or articulating its value propositions in new and novel ways, a meritocracy developed as quickly as the market, with some contributors earning outsized accolades from their peers.With that in mind, this list aims to identify the contributors who most helped to define and shape Bitcoin and its early years, identifying their specific efforts and spotlighting their relevant work.Martti Malmi (@Sirius)


Satoshi’s initial assistant, Martti Malmi, demonstrated a commitment to Bitcoin at a time when few were willing to see value in an internet currency that lacked even an exchange rate.A university student in May 2009, Malmi contributed most directly to Bitcoin.org and the Bitcoin Wiki, where he helped make the websites look more comprehensive and professional. (He was less kind to euros he used at the time, writing “Bitcoin.org” on any bills he encountered.) Malmi also added an early Austrian perspective to conversations around Bitcoin, dismissing complaints about gold as “old Keynesian arguments” and noting that the precious metal was “unmatched” by any paper money in the stability it offered over time.In his entrepreneurial efforts, Malmi was less successful, his early bitcoin exchange service, BitcoinExchange.com, struggling to get off the ground in 2010. Yet, he’d arguably make his biggest mark evangelizing for Bitcoin, creating a Facebook page (“Say no to central banking — use Bitcoin, the revolutionary P2P currency!” it read) and leading the first major effort to get Bitcoin publicity. Theymos 


One of Bitcoin’s most influential thinkers, Theymos never contributed code to the Bitcoin project directly but worked for years as a central moderator for its major forums.A keen student of the codebase, his influence was apparent from the project’s earliest days when on the Bitcoin.org forums or IRC Theymos could be counted on to define how the protocol worked, his understanding sometimes even surpassing that of other avid coders. What’s clear is that, after discovering Bitcoin in February 2010, Theymos went to work auditing the code, as his posts show an intricate understanding of not just the basic concepts, but even the more obscure commands Satoshi added to the codebase at launch.However, it’s Theymos’ contributions to project philosophy that perhaps stand out the most. The first to point out directly that changes to the code could result in issues impacting the rights of users, it’s clear Theymos thought deeply about the implications of Bitcoin’s design. For instance, he was at the forefront of arguing users could leverage their ability to fork the code if they ever disagreed with project leadership, an argument he’d push to its limits when he’d attempt to overturn a code change enacted by Satoshi.The fact that, when looking back at this disagreement, many would side with Theymos’ view on the matter is all the more evidence that his early thinking has endured.Hal Finney (@Hal)


A storied cypherpunk, Hal Finney tragically only contributed code briefly at the earliest days of Bitcoin and was absent for much of 2009 and 2010 as he struggled to regain his health. Still, Finney’s influence today rings far and wide, most notably for the enduring optimism with which he approached the project. Among his sparse blog posts are some of the most widely quoted moments from the project’s history, including his initial calculations on how, if successful, bitcoin could someday be worth millions should it grow to denominate global economic exchange.Elsewhere, Finney has even been credited with his own branch of philosophy on how Bitcoin might scale, the term “Finnian view” coming to denote his belief that second-layer networks, as well as bitcoin banks, would help solve the technology’s struggles to accommodate demand. Finney, who passed away in 2014 at 58, was also the recipient of the first-ever bitcoin transaction, and the only person known to have transacted directly with Satoshi Nakamoto. NewLibertyStandard


What is bitcoin worth? If it’s a question many have asked, NewLibertyStandard was the first to provide a response. Indeed, the first-ever quoted price for bitcoin was given by NewLibertyStandard on October 5, 2009, when they posted a daily exchange rate of 1,303 BTC per U.S. dollar. The calculation was made by factoring the cost of the electricity used to mine newly minted bitcoin and lauded by Satoshi as a helpful step in pricing the cryptocurrency.Not just the creator of the earliest bitcoin exchange, NewLibertyStandard proposed using the Thai baht symbol to represent Bitcoin and suggested “BTC” as its three-letter currency code.Despite his outsized contributions to the bitcoin economy, however, NewLibertyStandard could also wax philosophical. As an example, they were an early advocate for the idea that Bitcoin might enable individuals to peacefully exit their government currencies.Gavin Andresen


Andresen may not have been the father of Bitcoin, but in many ways, he raised the kid. An Australian-born Silicon Valley expat best known for creating a standard for 3D graphics in his younger days (VRML), Andresen had an established career in software prior to coding on Bitcoin, which included time spent at computer manufacturer Silicon Graphics. His rise up the ranks of the Bitcoin meritocracy would be swift. Not only did he give away over 1,000 bitcoin free of charge to new users, but he quickly became Satoshi’s most active contributor, gaining access to update the code directly by late 2010. Indeed, it would be Andresen who would “step up” in Satoshi’s absence, leading a charge to push new developers to get involved in the project and shouldering the weight of the press and media that descended during Bitcoin’s first rise to the fringes of the tech mainstream in 2011. Often now critiqued for his role in stoking later frictions in the project, it’s easy to overlook the fact that Andresen was also one of Bitcoin’s most eloquent early spokespeople, his arguments for it as a “just plain better money” finding ears when bitcoin was a “drug currency” to most.Laszlo Hanyecz (laszlo)


Best known as the man who spent thousands of bitcoin on pizza, Laszlo Hanyecz was a Florida-based coder who first translated Bitcoin (then available only for Windows) into MacOS. Joining the project in April 2010, Hanyecz quickly announced an interest in running Bitcoin on his iPhone, but it would be his May 2010 decision to pay 10,000 BTC to anyone who would buy him pizza that would mark his most significant contribution. At the time, Bitcoin had an established price (less than a penny), and bitcoin had been bought and sold, but no real-world product had ever been purchased with the fledgling currency. Hanyecz’s time with the project would be brief, however. He stopped contributing in August 2010 but has resurfaced from time to time for interviews, most recently in 2009 for the news show “60 Minutes” where he discussed his bitcoin pizza purchase.Artforz


A largely unknown figure, Artforz is nonetheless credited with notable engineering contributions, as they are thought to be the first Bitcoin user to mine with more powerful GPUs (in the process starting the global mining arms race that continues to this day).Though Artforz denied making up 25% of the early network’s hash rate as accused, it was a rumor during his day, one they eventually had to address directly on the forums.Still, if Artforz did mine an outsized number of early blocks, he showed himself to be an altruistic steward of the network, identifying a bug in one case that, if exploited, would have allowed him to spend bitcoin from other wallets he didn’t own, reporting it directly to Satoshi.Artforz could also explain and defend Bitcoin with the best of them. When presented with the idea users might never know the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, Artforz settled the conversation succinctly, stating simply: “Let the idea speak for itself.”Jeff Garzik (jgarzik)


A seasoned Linux open-source contributor by the time he found Bitcoin in 2010, Garzik is known for helping shape project strategy under Andresen, the developer he mentored and encouraged to step up in the wake of Satoshi’s absence.Yet, Garzik was an active contributor in the days of Satoshi as well, and he remains the author of some of the era’s more often-cited Bitcoin forum posts. Controversially, this includes the first proposal to raise the “block size limit,” first added by Nakamoto, as well as another, more influential proposal to remove subsidies for free transactions. Later conflicts aside, a review of Garzik’s posts shows what made him such a strong advocate for Bitcoin, one who was revered for thoughtful articulations on how the early network worked. In one memorable line, Garzik said: “The effort to raise the transaction rate limit is the same as the effort to change the fundamental nature of bitcoins: convince the vast majority to upgrade.”Ironically, it would be his efforts to lead such a charge that would mark the end of his time with the Bitcoin project nearly a decade later. Amir Taaki (genjix)


A former poker professional and open-source video game designer, Amir Taaki was little more than 20 years old when he stumbled on Bitcoin in late 2010. Though it wouldn’t be until 2014 that he graced the pages of Forbes and Wired on the strength of his preference for Bitcoin as a way to fight the establishment, Taaki showed the flashes of what would make him such a polarizing (and popular) figure even in the days of Satoshi. First and foremost, he’d attempt to get the organizations he most admired into Bitcoin — organizations like Anonymous and WikiLeaks. As he went about coding what would be the first-ever alternative implementation (libbitcoin), Taaki would find time to build a coalition to convince WikiLeaks to accept bitcoin, a decision that would eventually put him at odds with Satoshi who protested the move. “Sorry for trying to do something,” he would state in response to later criticism. His early forum posts showcase how and why Taaki would emerge as such a lightning rod, his responses equal parts combative, illuminating and pulsing with intensity. Kiba


Likely the least well-known name on this list, Kiba isn’t exactly an industry name.That said, they are responsible for helping shape something that continues to this day, the legacy of Satoshi Nakamoto. As a string of Twitter, IRC and BitcoinTalk posts from 2010 to 2011 show, Kiba was the first to play around with the idea of Satoshi’s identity, or in his own words, to try “damn hard to make the mystery of Satoshi a meme.” These efforts mostly took the form of sketches of Bitcoin’s creator, in which Kiba depicted him as everything from a Japanese warrior to a woman in a series he called “The Mysteries of Satoshi Nakamoto.” (His Bitcoin art, sadly, is lost to link rot.)But while he could be playful, it’s clear Kiba knew Bitcoin users were in charge, dropping early quotes that would be sure to kill on Twitter even today. “Satoshi’s invention is useless without us using it,” he wrote in October 2010. When Satoshi finally left the project, it was Kiba who declared what appears to be the first Bitcoin holiday, canonizing April 28, 2011, as “Satoshi Disappear Day,” writing: “I propose we make a Bitcoin holiday in honor of our legendary anonymous founder and to observe the fact that the bitcoin community will be just fine after the inventor of bitcoin left.”Today, Bitcoin Magazine carries on that tradition. "
Bitcoin Magazine,The Security Hustle: Protecting My Bitcoin From Hackers,"Wed, 28 Aug 2024 16:08:49 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-security-hustle-protecting-my-bitcoin-from-hackers,Bitcoin is a highly desirable asset to hackers. This extensive guide will help you protect your funds as a Bitcoin investor.,"Bitcoin, the world’s first and leading cryptocurrency, has proven its mettle in its roughly fifteen years of existence. From 2011 to 2021, it was the world's best-performing asset class in eight of the last eleven years. At the end of 2023, it reemerged as the world's top-performing asset class.It is also a trillion-dollar asset. BTC's market capitalization is at $1.13 trillion as of this writing. This value is outside the overall crypto market cap and excludes all other crypto coins. From a fledgling currency in 2008, its value has risen from nearly zero to over $73,000, reaching a historical all-time high in 2024.Bitcoin has minted many new millionaires and several billionaires. Famous founders of multi-billion dollar corporations involved in crypto include Brian Armstrong of Coinbase, Changpeng Zhao (CZ) of Binance, and Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy. With such a meteoric rise, it's hardly surprising that hackers keep trying to find ways to steal Bitcoin. As a Bitcoin owner, protecting your assets from cyber threats is critical. Here, we explore how BTC holders can protect their coins across platforms and activities.The Current BTC Security LandscapeHacks and losses in the crypto sphere are nothing new. In the second quarter of 2024 alone, the crypto ecosystem lost about $572.7 million due to fraudulent attacks and hacks. The figure is up 112 percent compared to the same period last year. The year's most significant BTC hack so far is that of DMM Bitcoin, a Japanese crypto trading platform. On May 31, 2024, DMM Bitcoin lost around $305 million worth of BTC. Moreover, the year-to-date (YTD) losses from crypto fraud and hacks have reached $920.9 million—up 24 percent from $720 million the previous year. May and June have seen exceptionally high losses, making up $358.5 million of total crypto incidents. Centralized finance (CeFi) platforms accounted for 70 percent of all losses.Hacking vs. fraud analysis: Hacks cause 98.5 percent of losses According to a report by Immunefi, a leading bug bounty platform, hacks are responsible for most crypto losses. As of the second quarter of 2024, hacks remain the predominant cause of losses versus fraud. Fraud accounts for only 1.5 percent of the overall crypto losses in Q2 2024. Hacks, on the other hand, account for 98.5 percent.Hacks In Q2 2024, the crypto ecosystem lost $564,238,811 to hacks spread across 53 incidents. This figure represents a 155 percent increase versus Q2 2023 when losses caused by hacks amounted to less than half: $220,522,129. Fraud Fraud-related loss in Q2 2024 was $8,450,050, spread across 19 specific incidents. These numbers represent a decrease of 81 percent compared to the same period last year.Bitcoin hackings you should know aboutDespite advancements in blockchain technology and security measures, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies remain vulnerable to hacking and security breaches. To understand how Bitcoin hacks happen, you should understand their progression and history. Here, we examine some of the most significant Bitcoin hacks and analyze what went wrong.The KuCoin hackIn September 2020, Singapore-based KuCoin, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a security breach. The intrusion resulted in the theft of over $280 million worth of cryptocurrencies, including 1008 Bitcoin. The hackers gained access to the exchange's hot wallets by exploiting weaknesses in its security protocols. According to KuCoin's CEO, its cold wallets were unaffected.In retrospect, enhanced security audits to identify vulnerabilities could have prevented the hack. It could also have been mitigated by using multi-signature or multisig wallets for the exchange's hot storage and storing the more significant portion of assets in cold storage to minimize the accessible amount.This Kucoin hack is not the first of it’s kind and certainly not the last. Just in June 2024 Kraken’s chief security officer disclosed “extremely critical” zero-day flaw in Kraken’s platform to steal $3M dollars. Here is how it was described: The ‘security researcher’ disclosed this bug to two other individuals who they work with who fraudulently generated much larger sums. They ultimately withdrew nearly $3 million from their Kraken accounts… They demanded a call with their business development team (i.e. their sales reps) and have not agreed to return any funds until we provide a speculated $ amount that this bug could have caused if they had not disclosed it. This is not white-hat hacking; it is extortion!

The Coinbase hacks of 2019 and 2021Coinbase is one of the most trusted platforms in the Bitcoin and crypto ecosystem. It is particularly dominant in the USA. As of this writing, Coinbase handles billions of dollars in transactions and has a market cap of $55.24 billion.The first significant breach that shook Coinbase and the crypto community occurred in 2019. The hack showed the ingenuity of the attackers. It was also a wake-up call for the whole cryptosphere, as it was more sophisticated than anyone expected. The attackers accessed Coinbase's internal systems using a sophisticated phishing campaign. They targeted employees with spear-phishing emails carefully crafted to appear legitimate communications from a trusted source.Over a dozen Coinbase employees initially received an email from Gregory Harris, supposedly a Research Grants Administrator at the University of Cambridge in the UK. The first email was dated May 30, 2019. According to Coinbase, the email came from the legitimate Cambridge domain. It had no apparent malicious elements, passed spam detection, and appeared from a knowledgeable source, referencing the recipients' backgrounds. Over the two weeks, the address continued sending emails, and nothing seemed amiss.The attacker sent a follow-up email on June 17. This time, the new email contained a malicious URL. If opened via a Firefox browser, it would install malware that could take over the target user's computer. According to Coinbase's security team, the emails were part of a ""sophisticated, highly targeted, thought out"" attack. Upon entering the network, the hackers moved laterally to escalate their access privileges. They exploited a Firefox zero-day vulnerability—an issue that had not yet been patched. Moreover, the attacks used not one but two Firefox zero-days, according to Philip Martin, the company's chief information security officer, in 2019. Coinbase reported the attacks to Mozilla.The vulnerability enabled the hackers to gain administrative access to the exchange’s backend network and critical systems, including databases for storing user information and private keys. In other words, a successful attack would allow a hacker to steal funds from the exchange. The tactic has been used numerous times and led to gigantic losses in crypto exchanges.This particular hack was unique because the attackers demonstrated remarkable patience and precision. They chose a more calculated, insidious, and covert approach over a swift and noisy attack. However, the breach was eventually detected. During a routine security audit, Coinbase's security team noticed unusual patterns of withdrawals. They launched an investigation and discovered the breach. They then acted swiftly to contain the damage. They secured the compromised systems, patched the exploited vulnerabilities, and enhanced their monitoring capabilities.After the hack, Coinbase publicly disclosed its details and mechanics. They assured users and the broader crypto community that the company's insurance policy covered most of the stolen funds and that no customer funds would be lost.Nonetheless, the incident had far-reaching implications. It highlighted the vulnerabilities inherent in even the most secure platforms and underscored the need to continuously improve cybersecurity practices. The Coinbase security team walked back the entire attack, contained it, and reported the zero-day to Firefox. The second breach that affected Coinbase was in late 2021. It involved the theft of approximately $100 million worth of cryptocurrencies, including BTC. Coinbase detected a platform vulnerability that enabled hackers to exploit a flaw in the crypto transfer process. The vulnerability led to unauthorized transactions and financial losses for some users on the platform.The Bitfinex hack of 2016Though it happened further back in the past, the Bitfinex hack is worth mentioning due to its magnitude. Hackers stole 119,756 BTC, valued at around $72 million. Today, based on the BTC price as of this writing, the same amount of BTC would be roughly $6.5 billion.This particular hack occurred due to vulnerabilities in the multi-signature security system that Bitfinex employed in collaboration with BitGo. It could have been avoided by using advanced authentication protocols, user behavior monitoring, and segregated wallet structures to limit exposure.BTC Security: Who should care?Bitcoin security affects large coin holders and average ones alike. Bitcoin is used for different purposes, not just as a plain vanilla investment tool you buy and hold. It can be a payment vehicle or trading instrument. It can be used as collateral and an underlying asset for various derivatives and derivative-like products. Its value and use cases are expanding as it is now used as the underlying for large-scale ETFs. Thus, you want to ensure your wallet is safe to protect your spending or day-trading money. According to Chainalysis, the number of unique Bitcoin addresses has ballooned to 460 million. While it is impossible to determine how many people own Bitcoin accurately, we can estimate its popularity based on the number of generated addresses over the years. We can also gauge active users through the number of wallets with active balances. According to BitInfoCharts, a blockchain analysis firm, over 67 million wallet addresses have a balance of $1 or more. Of these addresses, 40.5 million have a balance between $1 and $100, showing that most Bitcoin holders have a small amount of money invested.Prominent American entrepreneur Tom Lee predicts that BTC could rally to $150,000 in the coming months. Lee claimed that the asset’s valuation has been negatively affected lately due to the issues related to the now-defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox.The Mt. Goz ""overhang,"" as he calls it, brought down the price due to the long overdue payouts from its bankruptcy proceedings, paying back thousands of users up to almost $9 billion in assets. He expects the overhang to disappear sometime in July. Your small investment could yield appreciable returns if you buy and hold. Because of its long-term potential, security should matter to all BTC holders.The security of an individual also affects the ecosystem. KYC hacks and leaks affect an individual's privacy and identity, enabling malicious attackers to trace their activities. Such hacks can also be detrimental at the large investor or institutional level, leading to massive losses or draining the funds of individual investors signed up on a platform. In addition, BTC and crypto losses negatively impact the markets. Therefore, security is a shared responsibility of BTC holders of all sizes. The Importance of Using Secure PlatformsGiven its high price and widespread appeal, BTC remains a target for hackers. If you are invested in Bitcoin, choosing a secure platform for buying and storing Bitcoin is crucial for protecting your investments.Crypto custody solutionsCrypto custody solutions are businesses providing third-party crypto asset security and storage services. They mainly target accredited investors or institutions with significant Bitcoin or crypto holdings. Such clients include hedge funds, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and exchanges. These custody solutions generally combine hot and cold storage. Hot storage keeps you connected, but cold storage ensures your assets are safely offline.Dealing with crypto custody solutions providers requires understanding various crypto security procedures, hot and cold wallets, multisig solutions, and other best practices to ensure your crypto is safe.Which platform offers the best BTC storage and security?The answer to this question depends on your needs as a Bitcoin investor or holder. If you wish to buy BTC, you have several reliable options.According to investment strategist Lyn Alden, you can use Swan Bitcoin to buy BTC. Beyond a place to make one-time or recurring purchases for dollar-cost averaging (DCA), you should consider it as a Bitcoin accumulation platform. Swan provides Bitcoin IRA services for those investors who are serious about accumulating wealth long term.Fees for all trades are 0.99 percent of each purchase. They do this without taking a spread on your purchase, too, and the first $10,000 worth of BTC has zero fees.User-friendly securitySome notable security-related features include free auto-withdrawal to a self-custody address. Keeping your BTC with Swan's custodian is also free, and you can access it through them with the BTC held in your name. One simple yet ingenious way to use these features is to dollar cost average DCA into Bitcoin utilizing a plan that automatically buys BTC at regular intervals. The platform can also send it to your hardware wallet or another secure custody solution. According to their website, all Swan data is encrypted with military-grade AES-256 encryption, and traffic on the site is encrypted with industry-standard TLSv1.2 encryption. Moreover, Swan does not have access to nor store private keys for BTC that are stored with its custodial partners. Currently, Bakkt and Fortress Trust are the custodians of record. BitGo is its cold storage custodian. Some would consider Swan Bitcoin a Coinbase alternative for buying and storing BTC in the US. While Coinbase is the dominant player in the exchange business, Swan simplifies BTC investment for retail and institutional investors. Essential Security Tips To Safeguard Your BTCThe persistent attempts to hack BTC are a stark reminder of the ever-present risks lurking in the digital world. For users, it underscores the importance of personal security measures. Among these are enabling two-factor authentication and using hardware wallets for long-term storage of cryptocurrencies.The following are some concepts and tips that will help you protect your BTC holdings:Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA)Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides a second or additional layer of account security by requiring a second form of ownership verification outside your password. It is best defined as a process that increases the likelihood that a person is who they say they are. Rather than simply using a username and password, the 2FA process requests users to provide two authentication factors before accessing a crypto-related wallet, app, or platform.Organizations must use 2FA to protect their data and users in the face of a high-risk cybersecurity landscape, specifically in BTC and crypto, wherein you can expect a higher volume of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.One helpful way to frame 2FA is as a process that encourages people and organizations to stop solely relying on passwords to enter applications and websites.With 2FA, cybercriminals have more difficulty stealing users’ identities or accessing their devices. The measure also helps organizations fend off attackers, even when a password has been stolen from one or several users. Companies and individuals are using 2FA to prevent common cyber threats. These include phishing attacks that use users' passwords and spoof targets' identities after gaining credentials. Setting up 2FA for BitcoinTo set up 2FA for your BTC wallet, download a trustworthy authenticator like Authy, Google Authenticator, or other comparable apps. Access your BTC account and look for the 2FA section. Click ""Enable 2FA"". Link your account to the authenticator app by selecting ""Scan QR Code"" or ""Add Account"" on Google Authenticator. Afterward, scan the QR code shown on the BTC or crypto platform.Some systems provide additional backup codes called recovery keys. These codes are vital for account retrieval. You must store these codes in a safe location. If you misplace or lose your device with the corresponding authenticator app, you can use the backup codes to recover your Bitcoin wallet or account access.To complete your setup, you must enter the time-based one-time password (OTP) generated by the authenticator app when asked by your BTC or crypto platform. Log out of your account and try to re-access it to test your 2FA setup. This time, the wallet, app, or platform should ask you for an OTP from your authenticator app.Other 2FA techniques utilize SMS or email verification. While these are better than nothing, they are less safe and vulnerable to more attacks. SMS is susceptible to SIM-swapping attacks. Utilizing an authenticator app is deemed more secure.Hardware-based 2FA is a more stringent security measure that involves physical devices like YubiKey for verification. However, authenticator apps will do very well for regular everyday use.Ensure that your authenticator app is up to date and that your recovery keys are kept in a safe place, preferably offline. Hot vs. cold walletsAs a BTC holder, you must understand the difference between hot and cold crypto wallets. Hot wallets are software that stores your BTC private keys on a device that's online or connected to the Internet. They are convenient and easily accessible via online devices like mobile phones, tablets, or laptops.

Hot wallets often have more activity—they usually handle smaller, more frequent BTC transactions—and are convenient for trading. However, because they are online, they are vulnerable to hacks.On the other hand, cold wallets aren't connected to other devices or the Internet, making them less vulnerable to hacks and a more secure method of storing BTC private keys.Cold wallets are usually hardware devices that resemble modified USB sticks or mini plastic cards with buttons and screens. They cost between $50 and about $300, although they could be more expensive. Popular brands include Ledger and Trezor.Cold wallets like paper or metal wallets that record your private keys can be more straightforward. Their enhanced security is derived from their being offline. To trade funds from a cold wallet, you need to move them to a hot wallet that's connected to a crypto exchange.When you set up your hardware wallet, remember to write down your recovery seed phrase on paper and store it offline in a highly secure location. Please do not share this information with anyone or store it digitally.Stay updated with the latest security measuresThe Bitcoin and crypto space are continually evolving, and so are the hacking methods that threaten them. Thus, it is crucial to stay abreast of the latest security measures.Keep all your software updated to protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities. Read reputable sources for updates and security news. Protecting Your BTC Requires a Proactive ApproachIn a dynamic tech and crypto sphere, the only way to stay ahead of hackers is to be proactive about your security. Ensure you have all the basics covered: choosing a secure platform, enabling two-factor authentication, and using cold storage or hardware wallets to protect your BTC wealth.However, as hacks and exploits become more sophisticated, you can only fully secure your BTC when constantly updated on the latest security news. Also, ensure that your platforms and apps are continually on top of threats. If you are a buy-and-hold investor, ensure that your BTC funds are in cold storage.Security in BTC can be effectively summarized by the old and oft-quoted adage from the early days of Bitcoin: ""Not your keys, not your coins."" Make sure you have ultimate control over your private keys. And if you do choose a platform to hold them temporarily or entrust them with custody, understand the nuances of the agreement and infrastructure. Bitcoin was meant to be decentralized, so the more autonomous you are about managing your keys, the better security you have.This is a guest post by Ivan Serrano.

Bitcoin Magazine,"Remembering Hal Finney: A Decade Since His Passing, His Legacy in Bitcoin Lives On","Wed, 28 Aug 2024 15:22:00 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/remembering-hal-finney-a-decade-since-his-passing-his-legacy-in-bitcoin-lives-on,"Ten years after his passing, Hal Finney's pioneering work in cryptography and computer science continues to inspire the Bitcoin community.","Today marks the tenth anniversary of the passing of Hal Finney, a renowned cryptographer and computer scientist who played a pivotal role in the early days of Bitcoin. Finney, who passed away in 2014 due to complications from ALS, is celebrated for his profound contributions to Bitcoin and his foresight into the future potential of the nascent technology.10 years ago today, Hal Finney passed away.Finney was the recipient of the first ever Bitcoin transaction, receiving 10 #BTC from Satoshi Nakamoto.Today, we are all running #Bitcoin 🧡 pic.twitter.com/iRxgwQVNR7— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 28, 2024

Early in Finney's career he worked as a video game developer before he joined PGP Corporation, where he worked on early public-key cryptography software. His interest in digital privacy led him to the cypherpunks mailing list, where he collaborated with other pioneers in the field. In 2004, Finney created the world's first reusable proof-of-work (RPOW) system, a precursor to the proof-of-work consensus mechanism that underpins Bitcoin.However, Finney is perhaps best known for his early involvement with Bitcoin. As one of the first to recognize the revolutionary potential of Satoshi Nakamoto's creation, Finney became an active participant in the project. He famously received the first Bitcoin transaction from Nakamoto himself and contributed to the development of the protocol. His 2009 tweet, ""Running bitcoin,"" remains an iconic moment in Bitcoin history.14 years ago today, cryptographer Hal Finney made the first #Bitcoin tweet ever 🧡RIP Hal 🙏 pic.twitter.com/zsCsKEiGnO— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) January 10, 2023

Despite being diagnosed with ALS in 2009, Finney continued to contribute to Bitcoin, using eye-tracking software to code even as the disease progressed. His resilience and dedication have left an indelible mark on the world and those interested in Bitcoin. “Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube,” Finney published on the Bitcoin Talk Forum on March 19, 2013. “It’s been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad… I still love programming and it gives me goals… I’m comfortable with my legacy.”As the community reflects on his legacy, here is one of the only known recorded videos of Finney speaking at the Crypto 98 conference, discussing zero-knowledge proofs, shedding light on his pioneering work on cryptographic protocols.✨New video of #Bitcoin pioneer Hal Finney unearths a 25-year-old talk on zero-knowledge crypto The 1st time I've ever heard him speak 🧡 pic.twitter.com/SkGrnae81L— The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) September 20, 2023

Bitcoin Magazine,Bitwise Brings The Bitcoin Ethos To Wall Street ,"Wed, 28 Aug 2024 14:37:33 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitwise-brings-the-bitcoin-ethos-to-wall-street-,"Bitwise co-founder Hong Kim is a hardcore Bitcoiner who’s determined to uphold Bitcoin’s ideals as his company, which issued one of the 11 US spot bitcoin ETFs, brings bitcoin to the world of traditional finance.","Company Name: Bitwise Asset ManagementFounders: Hong Kim and Hunter HorsleyDate Founded: December 2016Location of Headquarters: San Francisco, CA and New York, NYAmount of Bitcoin Held in Treasury: UndisclosedNumber of Employees: 65Website: https://bitwiseinvestments.com/Public or Private? PrivateIn 2016, Hong Kim and his co-founder at Bitwise Asset Management (Bitwise), Hunter Horsely, were living the startup life — working from a living room in San Francisco and looking for a project that they could develop into a business.While experimenting with various ideas, none of which were gaining much traction, their friends wouldn’t shut up about Bitcoin. Plus, by early 2016, every venture capital firm in Silicon Valley was focused on Bitcoin, as well.“We wanted to avoid it for a long time because [there was] too much hype,” Kim told Bitcoin Magazine. “But then, just by osmosis, we spent more and more time thinking about it.”By the end of the year, after doing their homework on Bitcoin, Kim and Horsely had incorporated Bitwise, a bitcoin-first crypto asset management firm that would provide wrappers for bitcoin so that customers could purchase these assets via traditional brokerages.Eight years later, Bitwise was one of the 11 US firms to issue a spot bitcoin ETF; it’s currently the 5th largest US spot bitcoin ETF as per the amount of assets under management (AUM). This is in part due to the Bitcoin enthusiasts who’ve purchased it because of how Bitwise has maintained the Bitcoin ethos as it’s interfaced with Wall Street.Bitwise vs. All Other Spot Bitcoin ETF IssuersThere are a number of factors that differentiate the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) from its competitors.For one, Bitwise is the only company that issues a US spot bitcoin ETF that publishes the addresses of its bitcoin holdings, embracing the idea of transparency, a core Bitcoin tenet.Announcement: Today the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) becomes the first U.S. bitcoin ETF to publish the bitcoin addresses of its holdings.Now anyone can verify BITB's holdings and flows directly on the blockchain.Onchain transparency is core to Bitcoin's ethos. We're proud to… pic.twitter.com/1JTUh3zvDE— Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) January 24, 2024

“Even now, many, many months have passed and still we're the only Bitcoin ETF that discloses its holding addresses,” said Kim. “You can go to a Bitcoin block explorer and check our on-chain holdings.”Kim also made the point that Bitwise is the only spot bitcoin ETF issuer that proactively communicates with its customers via social media.“We are on Twitter talking about a product and answering questions,” explained Kim.“I'll explain anything and engage with the community. If there's anything they're upset about [regarding] the products, they can yell at us and we respond and take them seriously,” he added.What is more, Kim pointed out that Bitcoin remains Bitwise’s primary focus, which makes the company much different from other spot bitcoin ETF issuers like BlackRock or Invesco who manage a plethora of other types of assets.“We've been around for seven years or so and this is the only thing that we talk about,” said Kim.“When prices go down when there's a bear market, We don't rotate to emerging markets or fixed income or whatever,” he added.“There might not be that big of a difference between BlackRock and Invesco or BlackRock or Franklin Templeton, but there's a big difference between BlackRock and Bitwise.”Lastly, Bitwise has committed to giving 10% of its ETF fee profits to three nonprofits that support Bitcoin Core developers — OpenSats, Brink and the Human Rights Foundation (HRF) — for 10 years.Donating To Open-Source DevelopersWhile many in the Bitcoin community have praised Bitwise for donating to Bitcoin Core developers, Kim sees this contribution as more of an obligation and less as a sacrifice.“As a Bitcoiner, I feel that it's not really a donation,” said Kim.“The US taxpayer doesn't think that they're donating to the military budget,” he added.“That’s not a donation. That’s your security budget.”Kim went on to explain that while Bitwise does manage some other crypto assets, two-thirds of the company’s holdings is bitcoin. For this reason, he views supporting Bitcoin Core developers as contributing the technology that buoys his livelihood.“If you're like BlackRock, where you have all sorts of other [assets] and bitcoin is only one of them, then maybe you don't feel that way,” Kim said in regard to why a company like Bitwise cares about bitcoin more than some of the bigger traditional financial institutions that issued spot bitcoin ETFs.“If you are like me or are in an economic situation like me and you care enough about Bitcoin, then it’s not an optional matter that the Bitcoin network is as secure as it can be,” he added.Kim, Bitwise’s CTO, who has a background in cybersecurity, explained why open-source developers are essential to Bitcoin, noting that many who don’t understand how open-source technology works misperceive what Bitcoin developers do. He made the argument that the majority of Bitcoin developers aren’t there to make radical changes to Bitcoin, but to keep it functional as it interfaces with other software.“You can have an opinion about the latest contentious soft fork proposal or whatever, but 95% of the devs that we're talking about don't work on that,” Kim explained.“The 50 or so core devs that do this day in and day out, that's not what they're spending time on. Whenever there's a new version of Linux or Mac or Windows, guess what — we need to make sure that Bitcoin Core compiles on that version,” he continued.“Somebody needs to make sure that the software we depend upon continues to be compatible, well-documented, and runnable.”On A MissionWhile Bitwise does a lot to differentiate itself from its competitors, Kim wants Bitwise to do something more profound than just being one of the better US spot bitcoin ETF issuers.“There are ways of thinking about a business as the product [it offers] or how it’s different from its competitors, but I think there's another way of looking at a company as like, ‘What are you here to do?’” explained Kim.He shares that he and Horsely didn’t start by asking themselves this question, though, now, it seems to be at the forefront of his mind.“I want Bitwise to be the company that helps accelerate and guide this movement, because it's such an important thing for the world to have public money that everyone can access and that nobody controls,” said Kim.After sharing this, Kim acknowledged what he felt many might be thinking as they read this: You’re offering exposure to bitcoin’s price within the walled garden of traditional finance.“TradFi and Bitcoin culture are inevitably colliding and people rightfully have concerns and some kind of dissonance about that,” said Kim. “That was really top of mind for me.”Kim reiterated that this is why Bitwise chose to donate to open-source Bitcoin developers, make their Bitcoin addresses public and engage with the Bitcoin community. And he also shared some information on what Bitwise is working on next: redeemable bitcoin.Redeemable BitcoinBitwise is currently speaking with policymakers in Washington, DC in efforts to have Bitwise facilitate in-kind redemptions of bitcoin from the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF. In layperson’s terms, Kim wants Bitwise customers to be able to withdraw the bitcoin in which they’ve invested via the ETF if they so please, whereas, right now, customers can only withdraw the cash value of the bitcoin in which they’ve invested via bitcoin ETF.“There are gold ETFs where you can redeem, even as an individual retail investor, and get gold coins and bars delivered to your door,” explained Kim. “You redeem in-kind without incurring a taxable event. There's no reason that a bitcoin ETF shouldn't be able to do that,” he added.“That would be a product that I would be proud of.”Kim believes that if Bitwise can make redeemable bitcoin a reality for investors, then spot bitcoin ETFs like BITB have the potential to become some of the biggest on-ramps to Bitcoin.“Bitcoin ETFs are a huge improvement [in Bitcoin onboarding] in that most people have brokerage accounts,” said Kim, who added that it’s much easier to get family and friends to invest in bitcoin when they don’t have to go through the hassle of setting up an account with a Bitcoin or crypto exchange.“If your uncle at the Thanksgiving table is convinced and wants to put $100 into bitcoin, you no longer have to go, ‘Wait a minute. First buy a ledger for $40…’ [Now, it’s] just two taps and you have a hundred dollars worth of Bitcoin exposure,” he added.“But then, at any point in their journey, if they are so inclined, they can withdraw that. And in that sense, it can become a really clean and simple on-ramp.”While Kim acknowledged that many are skeptical this will ever happen — speculating that Wall Street wants as much bitcoin within walled gardens as possible — he also noted that many felt the same way about the spot bitcoin ETFs ever being issued. He requested some patience as Bitwise persists in its efforts to knock down the wall between Bitcoin and traditional finance.“There's a way of looking at Bitcoin ETFs as a clean and easy on-ramp and off-ramp and the lowest friction one for the average person,” said Kim.“That would be my ideal world, and that is a world that Bitwise is currently working on,” he added.“In that world, the ETFs and the on-chain world aren’t as separate, but rather they can have a close relationship.”"

The outflow ended an eight-day streak of positive inflows totaling $756 million into the Bitcoin products.","U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $127 million in net outflows on Tuesday, marking the largest single-day withdrawal since Aug. 6. The outflow ended an eight-day streak of positive inflows totalling $756 million.On Tuesday, the Bitcoin ETF offering from Ark Invest saw the biggest outflow, at $102 million. Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust and Bitwise's Bitcoin ETF also posted net outflows of $18 million and $7 million, respectively.BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF saw no inflows after a $224 million inflow on Monday, its largest in over a month, while Fidelity's and other Bitcoin ETFs also saw no changes in inflows or outflows.The largest contributor to yesterday's outflows seems to have been investors' profit-taking after Bitcoin surged past $60,000 early this week. Since then, Bitcoin has pulled back around 10% below $60,000 upon this news.The ETF outflows came as leading financial institutions expanded their bitcoin product offerings. On Tuesday, CME Group launched a new Bitcoin futures contract aimed at retail traders.

Bitcoin Magazine,A Manual Guide to Killing Bitcoin: The Eternal Return,"Tue, 27 Aug 2024 19:16:52 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/a-manual-guide-to-killing-bitcoin-the-eternal-return,"From the fall of peer-to-peer networks to the dangers of blind optimism, this guide explores how Bitcoin could face existential threats unless we change course. Overconfidence and arrogance could be Bitcoin's biggest threats. From ""The Halving Issue"".","This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine’s “The Halving Issue”. Click here to get your copy.Every morning at 6am, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, the cynic weatherman Phil Connors wakes up to experience the same day over and over and over again. Stuck in a time loop, Connors tries everything to get his life back to normal – he gets stabbed, shot, burned, frozen and electrocuted, only to wake up again the next day as if nothing had happened. Connors quickly comes to the only plausible conclusion: he must be a god.Thinking ourselves to be undefeatable has never been a particularly smart strategy, in times of war or otherwise. If we believe in cosmology, from Nietzsche to Hinduism, time is a loop, and there is a finite realm of possibilities which infinitely repeat – the only thing that we can really do is change how we react. Unless we learn from our mistakes, we are doomed to experience the same things over and over again.Though often priding ourselves in exceptional intellect – I’ve found Bitcoin early, I must be very smart – it seems that learning from mistakes comes hard even for the most seasoned ‘Bitcoin advocates’. Public discourse seems to have shifted from the discussion of technological challenges and limitations to Deutsche Bank afterwork chats – Anything is possible, we’ll just need returns to remain on track.When Bitcoin was first discussed in German Parliament back in 2014, ‘experts’ highlighted the ease with which bitcoin payments could be deanonymized via network analysis, speaking to the risks of widespread bitcoin adoption to lead towards total financial surveillance. Today, ten years later, as Bitcoin has returned to German parliament, ‘experts’ have been exchanged for influencers proposing Bitcoin as CBDC alternatives. Current ‘Bitcoin political debates’ cannot help but remind us of Bart Simpson running in circles banging a pan on his head.As we continue to close in on the opportunist’s echo chamber, we have successfully swapped academic debate for cheerleading squads. Things will go great so long as you’re willing to take your tits out. ‘We’re winning!’ has long become the prevalent meme – Between ETF approvals, stablecoin issuances, and possible nation state adoption we are so confident in Bitcoin’s success that we seem incapable of realizing that this is precisely how you lose. Arrogance comes before most declines, and its exploitation has always been by design. By sowing manic delusions of invincibility, even the most trained commander will lead their sheep to slaughter. 


Groundhog DayA long long time ago, in a galaxy far away, we plugged our computers into landlines to access the three great W’s. For anyone who didn’t live alone, this practice was often doomed to reap a fair amount of havoc – Get off the computer, mom is waiting for a phone call.So we can all agree that that sucked. But, due to a lack of technological advancements and accessibility to communicate wirelessly across distances (think of your favorite mesh network here), it was the most convenient option we had. The only problem: it led to a monopoly on web access points lying with telecommunications providers. Fast forward 20 years, and we now know that telecom providers monitor, analyze, and report anything that we do on the internet to government authorities under the guise of national security. A technology thought invincible for the liberation of the people quickly turned into its biggest enemy.


Now we can’t really talk about the success (and downfall) of peer-to-peer technologies without talking about Linkin Park. Linkin Park’s music, then still Hybrid Theory, circulated widely on the first P2P music file sharing network Napster. Downloaded from other people’s computers, accessing Linkin Park’s music was completely free. Their first studio album, Hybrid Theory, yet remains one of the top five most sold records in the world with 15 Million copies sold in the first three weeks alone.Napster was a real world internet revolution – And the music industry was furious. As people happily infected their devices with potential computer AIDS, bands, rappers, and singer songwriters like the Arctic Monkeys, Dispatch or EMINEM were building fanbases even before breaking their first big record releases, and the musical establishment wasn’t having it. When Metallica sued the P2P platform for copyright infringement, clearly unhappy that their cult status and its consequential returns felt threatened, peer-to-peer music file sharing did not exactly die, but was quickly incorporated into more corporate friendly formats – from buying music via iTunes to music streaming via Spotify.While it seemed unimaginable to put a technology like Napster back into the box, convenience, again, became king. Today, the majority of listeners do not own the music that they listen to, but subscribe to corporate databases of which neither artists, labels nor producers profit. Instead, the big winner of the music file sharing industry again turned out to be surveillance. Just last week, when Spotify updated its cookie policy, a push notification let EU users know which 695 data brokers would gain access to their information. Downloading files like ClapYourHandsSayYeah.mp3.exe (RIP) clearly was risky business, but the risks of surveillance capitalism reach much farther than a trashed computer.In essence, the same thing happened to search engines. Going online in the early days of the world wide web was like getting dropped off in the middle of Yellow Stone national park without a map. There were thousands of places to go, but you needed to know where they were. With comprehensive link collections, platforms like Yahoo, AskJeeves or Google offered tremendous value to those less versed in their way around the WWW. Instead of asking your peers where something cool on the internet was, you simply asked Google. But, with moving away from word-of–mouth formats, we ended up with what has today been termed the great enshittification. The first few links are paid affiliate sites, and the ones after that are those who figured out how to efficiently play Google’s SEO formats, of course all packed and tailored to your supposed needs. Today, Google is one of the most valuable surveillance companies in the world. A software meant to aid in the liberalization of free information essentially became a tool for censorship.Again and again, thinking that ‘technology has won’ only exacerbated its demise. We choose what is comfortable now only to stab ourselves in the back down the road. And before you know it – BING! It’s the whistling belly button at the high school talent show as the weatherman strikes again. To put it bluntly: we’re fucking up.It’s the Filters, StupidIn today’s pop-culture Bitcoin discourse, ignorance runs rampant. Lightning works until it doesn’t, let’s spend millions to put the Dollar on Bitcoin; It’s called priorities babe, look it up.When Ordinals hit Bitcoin – think of them what you will – we suddenly realized that we were in trouble. In the global south, people quickly became unable to transact non-custodially. All the people you’ve told to DCA suddenly saw themselves facing exorbitant transaction fees, unable to move their funds. For those valuing their privacy even for smaller spends, participating in coinjoin rounds turned prohibitively expensive. No matter where we look, we still have a scaling problem. This problem does not exist because of Ordinals. It exists because we were so convinced of winning that we lost track of keeping our ignorance in check.Over the past four years, the majority was more concerned with furthering its own narrative – everything is awesome and Bitcoin is the bestest currency on earth – than facing uncomfortable truths. We then proceeded to respond with an exorbitant amount of shortsightedness: it’s the filters, stupid.Filtering out Ordinals transactions is a short term solution for a long term problem. Sure, blocking arbitrary data on the blockchain will necessarily drive fees down, but if global Bitcoin adoption is what you want, you’re not doing yourself any favors by proposing selective solutions to systemic issues. The thing is that being angry at JPEGs is easy. Taking on problems that challenge the ‘greatness of Bitcoin’, which some appear to have turned into their whole personality, is not. For every tweet that claims for Bitcoin to bring world peace – clearly by pure magic, or what the Wall Street losers turned Bitcoin economists call some backwards form of game theory – a little of the system dies.We do not need your hopium; We need real world solutions to real world problems. That includes laying down the crack pipe and talking about the uncomfortable stuff: we are not winning – we are doing the opposite, because our ‘long time preference’ reaches about as far as our investment portfolios. You can kill Bitcoin. And it’s easier than you’d think.


Embrace, Extend, Extinguish Over the past few years, debates around Bitcoin ‘winning’ looked pretty much the same. Senators are embracing Bitcoin: see, we are winning. BlackRock is embracing Bitcoin: see, we are winning. First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they realize that all you want is a pat on the back before the policeman comes to take your toys away. The laughing hasn’t stopped, it just happens behind your back. The most plausible death of Bitcoin would happen less in name than in its total incorporation, at a point where the technology is simply not yet ready for ‘mass adoption’ – just like we have killed all peer-to-peer technologies that came before it. The death of Bitcoin is not the death of the tech, but the death of its usability.At the center of the death of Bitcoin, at least in essence, continues to stand the scaling debate. When Gigablocks were first proposed, it seemed fairly obvious that a blockchain that takes 10 years to sync will lack in decentralization. In came the Lightning Network, which seemed to solve all of our issues: Scaling off-chain, securing on-chain. Smart. Except that we can only fit around 5000 channel opening and closing transactions inside of a block – hardly enough to let 8 Billion people use Bitcoin non-custodially.Unfortunately, that didn't stop influencers – or really anyone - from proclaiming their Hail Mary of desperation; Scaling Bitcoin obviously is a problem for future me. Too high was the thrill of finally being able to sit at the corporate dinner table and smug the obligatory 'I told you so'. Putting non-believers into their place simply had to come first; if Bitcoin doesn't exist to feed our fragile egos and pump up our sad little bank accounts, what really was the point? Freedom, Carajo! Welcome to your involuntary conversion at the church of satoshi's witnesses, where we drop speeches on saving the world from tyranny more often than Biden changes his diapers.So here we are. Six years after we bought our first stickers at the Blockstream store – the only thing you were able to buy when the first Lightning implementations launched, besides beer – and we're still scrambling. Instead of fostering broad discussions around covenant proposals, which do come with real trade-offs and risks, we are busy labeling anyone not willing to ossify a spook, while ossification at this point in Bitcoin will certainly be the surest way to kill it.Sometime in the near future, we'll wish ourselves back to a time of a few hundred vBytes in fees. By then, we will have no choice but to use Bitcoin custodially. Say goodbye to freedom money: Bitcoin as we know it will be dead, unless we stop making the same mistakes. "
Bitcoin Magazine,An Untold Story of Bitcoin in Thailand,"Tue, 27 Aug 2024 16:20:41 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/an-untold-story-of-bitcoin-in-thailand,"The story of Didier Somnuke, a Thai Bitcoiner, and his journey through Bitcoin.","In the rapidly expanding global Bitcoin community, Western biases often dominate the narrative, overlooking diverse stories from around the world. One such story belongs to Didier Somnuke, a small business owner in the heart of Bangkok, a city known for welcoming 22.8 million international tourists in 2023, surpassing cities like Paris, London, and New York City. Although Thailand has experienced a massive spike in household debt, reaching 16.37 trillion baht (US$463 billion) or 90.8% of the national GDP, up from less than 14 trillion baht in 2019.Didier Somnuke, born in Yala province, where geopolitical conflict is a harsh reality. Southern Thailand is one of the poorest parts of Thailand with a poverty rate of 34% compared to the national average of 6%, according to the World Bank, has been plagued by instability. Since 2004, this turmoil has claimed over 7,000 lives and injured 13,500 people.As a Thai saying goes, “ทวงสิทธิ์ที่จะมีชีวิตที่ดีกลับคืนมา” (Reclaim the right to a better life), In 2012, Didier left his conflict-ridden hometown for Bangkok, where pursuing higher education was a beacon of hope for a better life. At that time, Bitcoin and financial concepts were distant ideas in Didier's universe. Navigating the vibrant streets of Bangkok, Didier completed his master's degree and joined the workforce, taking up a typical 9-to-5 job. For a domestic migrant, this was a significant achievement. Reflecting on his journey, he recalled his teacher’s words, “When you are old, you have time and money, but you will lack the energy to start a business. If you want to do it, just do it.” With this advice in mind, Didier resigned from his monotonous corporate job after a year and opened a new chapter in his life.Didier borrowed 50,000 THB (approximately 1,500 USD) from his brother to begin a street burger shop. He chose to start a burger business because he believed it was easy to launch with a small investment. Driven by his ambition and inspired by the bustling energy of Bangkok, a city that never sleeps. He spent about a year developing the recipe and began the business in 2015. In the first three to four years, he managed everything on his own as a solo entrepreneur, and his income was lower than the wage he earned in his corporate job. He often wondered if he had made a mistake by quitting his job to start a business that generated less income. However, after five years, everything started to improve. Sales at the shop began to increase, and Didier started hiring employees.He admitted, ""I entered the crypto market with greed; all I wanted was to get rich quickly."" In 2017, he and his friends pooled their resources to buy three ASIC miners from Bitmain to try mining Bitcoin and altcoins like Litecoin and Dogecoin. They saw a return on their investment within six months. Didier bought his first Bitcoin in early 2017 to purchase those ASIC miners but didn't know how to transfer his Bitcoin, so he ended up using a bank transfer instead.Reflecting on his early experiences, he recalled, ""My first Bitcoin were slowly converted to shitcoins during the bull market. I was so lucky. I got a 100% profit almost immediately whenever I bought something."" Despite having zero knowledge about cryptocurrency, he gained confidence and became a super shitcoiner, paying very little attention to Bitcoin.In mid-2017, he learned about leverage and trading. His profits skyrocketed due to leverage. Although luck was not always on his side forever, in early 2018, the market crashed, and he lost over 1 million Thai baht (almost 30,000 USD), while his initial capital was just about 100,000 Thai baht (about 3,000 USD). On top of that, he also lost his shitcoins from the mining pool. He had kept all of his shitcoins in the mining pool's custody, and one day, when he checked his account, every shitcoin he owned, worth 10,000 USD were gone. The notice on the mining website, ""Hash-to-Coin,"" stated that if coins were kept with them for more than three months, they would be considered a donation.


He disheartenedly said, ""I lost everything."" But unlike most people, ""I didn't blame Bitcoin. I still see it as the future. I blame myself. I didn't know anything and I did over leverage."" He emphasized that despite his heavy financial losses, his girlfriend did not leave him. ""My girlfriend was my customer. She regularly came to buy burgers. I met her while I was struggling financially during my early days as an entrepreneur. She supported me and said we could make the money back.""Determined to turn his circumstances around, he discovered Mr. Piriya on YouTube and started following his live streams about the real Bitcoin education. This marked the moment he began to truly understand what Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are. Enlightened by this unique knowledge, he came to see Bitcoin as a saving technology rather than just a trading tool. Over three years, Didier recovered from his losses and emerged stronger. He got to be friend with Mr. Piriya, and together they founded a company called Right Shift to develop Bitcoin content in Thai language through multiple social media channels, including on Nostr with with one of the popular hashtag #siamstr. As a team, they translated ""The Bitcoin Standard"" and ""The Fiat Standard"" into Thai, both of which became best-selling books in Thailand. They organized the first-ever Bitcoin Thailand Conference in 2023 and are now preparing for the next one in September 2024.


Didier now accepts Bitcoin as a payment method in his main burger shop, one of four different franchises. He uses Wallet of Satoshi to process these payments. Within a year of implementing this initiative, he has received over 3 million sats in payments, though he initially expected to see more transactions in Bitcoin. In his marketplace, some neighboring small business owners occasionally ask him about Bitcoin as they notice the large Bitcoin poster in his shop. Although they often lose interest once he explains, according to his several unsuccessful experience. Instead now, he focuses his energy online, where he can make more impact to people who are willing to embrace innovation.


In 2022, approximately 8.4 million people in Thailand, accounting for 12% of the country's population, used cryptocurrency. Estimates suggest that by 2028, this number will rise to about 17.67 million, representing 25% of the population. During our conversation, Didier claimed that there are about 50,000 Bitcoin users in Thailand and speculated that the Thai government might intervene in Bitcoin adoption, potentially mandating the use of KYC wallets because they dislike money systems they can't control. In the worst-case scenario, Didier remains resolute: he will continue advocating for Bitcoin with his friends. ""It is not an option,"" he asserted, ""it is the only way to survive.""This is a guest post by Win Ko Ko Aung.

The Bitcoin Cycle Master chart integrates on-chain metrics, including Coin Value Days Destroyed and Terminal Price, to assess Bitcoin’s position within its economic cycles. Historically, these cycles occur approximately every four years, aligning with Bitcoin halving events.


The Bitcoin Cycle Master tool analyzes actual economic behavior on the Bitcoin blockchain to determine whether Bitcoin is undervalued, fairly valued, aggressively valued, or overvalued. Presently, the data indicates that Bitcoin is at a fair market value, suggesting a balanced state between demand and supply within the current cycle.This tool not only identifies periods of increased risk, where transaction behaviors hint at major cycle highs, but also highlights value opportunities during cycle lows. By tracking on-chain transaction patterns, the Bitcoin Cycle Master provides insights into potential future price movements, potentially helping investors make more informed decisions.Institutions, analysts, and Bitcoin enthusiasts are optimistic about a price increase later in the year, drawing on historical trends where Bitcoin’s value tends to rise many months following a halving event. This sentiment has been further bolstered by recent predictions from prominent figures in the financial sector.

China is getting prepared 🙌 pic.twitter.com/GQZC1Z5UFC— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 26, 2024

The milestone comes just months after Hong Kong approved its first spot bitcoin ETFs, following similar moves in the U.S. and Europe. The ETFs provide exposure to Bitcoin prices without directly owning Bitcoin.While volumes have been slower than U.S. Bitcoin ETFs, assets under management have steadily climbed. This suggests a growing institutional appetite for regulated Bitcoin products in Asia.The ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF is the largest of the Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs, with over $142 million in net assets. Bosera Hashkey's Bitcoin ETF comes next with around $99 million in holdings, followed by Harvest Bitcoin ETF with $31 million. Together, the total Bitcoin holdings across the three Hong Kong ETFs stand at approximately 4,450 BTC, worth $272 million at current prices.Industry observers believe innovations like the ETFs' redemption method could attract more capital over time. The Hong Kong products allow for in-kind redemptions using actual Bitcoin, unlike cash-only U.S. ETFs.The growth indicates increasing Bitcoin adoption by institutional investors in Asia. If interest in Hong Kong's spot Bitcoin ETFs continues at the current pace, they could emerge as a significant regional pool of Bitcoin demand.Other Asian countries, such as Singapore, Malaysia, and South Korea, are also in the pipeline to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs. This could further integrate Bitcoin within mainstream finance across the continent."
Bitcoin Magazine,"Report From The DNC: Democrats Warm Up To Bitcoin And Crypto, But Offer No Policy Specifics","Fri, 23 Aug 2024 16:07:35 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/report-from-the-dnc-democrats-warm-up-to-bitcoin-and-crypto-but-offer-no-policy-specifics,"While there was hardly any talk of Bitcoin or crypto at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) this week, Democrats are no longer ignoring the topic.","Bitcoin was not a big topic at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) this week. None of the speakers at the event uttered a word about the electronic cash system or other crypto assets from the event’s main stage at Chicago’s United Center. And you’d have been hard pressed to have overheard a conversation on Bitcoin or crypto anywhere in the halls of the arena either.However, despite the fact that Democrats chose not to include Bitcoin or crypto in their official platform, some high-ranking Democrats did say this week that a Harris administration would be more pro-Bitcoin and pro-crypto than the Biden administration has been — though without offering specifics. Also, at satellite events for the conference, some Democrats spoke passionately about why their party should embrace Bitcoin and crypto.Congressman Wiley Nickel (D-NC), a Bitcoin and crypto proponent, spoke to the idea that a Harris administration will take a different approach to the crypto industry than the Biden administration has.“Vice President Harris has been working for and as part of the Biden-Harris administration, but now she's coming into this campaign with her own positions on issues,” Rep. Nickel told Bitcoin Magazine explained in an interview at the convention.“A lot has happened in the last few week’s, so she’s [only now] starting to come out with policy positions. It's not going to be an immediate process of her coming out with things she would do differently from President Biden, but she will have different positions on issues, and she will make those known,” he added.On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Vice President Harris will introduce policies to support the crypto industry if elected. This was according to her senior campaign advisor for policy, who spoke at a Bloomberg News roundtable at the convention.The article touched on how Harris plans to engage with the cryptocurrency industry — though, again it didn’t offer any particulars on how she plans to do so. It also quoted Harris saying that she plans to “cut needless bureaucracy and unnecessary regulatory red tape” while encouraging “innovative technologies” by offering “transparent rules of the road,” though none of Harris’ quotes in the piece included any direct references to Bitcoin or crypto.Rep. Nickel didn’t offer any specifics on what Harris’ policy might look like either, as he said he didn’t want to speak on behalf of Harris, but did note the success of the Crypto4Harris town hall, an event held on Wednesday, August 15, that featured Democratic lawmakers including Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand (D-NY) and Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) as well as billionaire crypto enthusiast Mark Cuban, sharing that there’s “a real sense of momentum amongst Democrats on the issue.”Rep. Nickel also asked Bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts to heed a certain warning.“The anti-crypto names you hear are just totally invented by folks who are trying to damage her campaign,” said Rep. Nickel about rumors of Harris bringing the likes of Brian Reese and Bharat Ramamurti, economic advisors from the Biden administration who were behind Operation Chokepoint 2.0, back into the fold.“I don't [give] any credence to the weird names that you hear being thrown around for big jobs. I heard Gary Gensler for Treasury Secretary. I can tell you that there's 0% chance that he would be able to be confirmed by the Senate,” he added. “That one is not happening.”Pro-Bitcoin/Pro-Crypto Democrats Speak At Satellite EventsAt an event held at a University of Chicago facility, Cleve Mesidor, Executive Director of the Blockchain Foundation and former Obama appointee who worked as the Director of Public Affairs at Commerce’s Economic Development Administration (EDA), spoke on a panel entitled “Democrats’ Path Forward On Digital Assets & Crypto.” TODAY: I’m Speaking in Chicago During DNC Convention!I’m excited to be part of this panel hosted by @ProgressChamber & @BusinessForward, which also features:@RepWileyNickel | @clydevanel | @JBSDC @paradigm| @KyleBligen= Democrats' Path Forward On Digital Assets & Crypto = pic.twitter.com/WIYggp1V9o— Cleve Mesidor (@cmesi) August 21, 2024

Mesidor shared her perspective on the importance of crypto, which differed notably from the perspectives of notoriously anti-crypto Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA).“Senator Liz Warren and Congressman Brad Sherman are stuck in time,” said Mesidor on the panel.“They are so determined to fight big money, so laser focused on hitting the big guys, that their blind spot is the fact that communities of color are the largest adopters of cryptocurrency. Black and Latino communities lead national adoption of this $2 trillion market,” she added.“Let's be clear, consumer protection is important — we need guardrails. But if you don't couple it with financial inclusion, you're just saying to all of the communities who capitalized on bitcoin over the last 15 years — who made it something, who built products and services on blockchain — that you’re going to continue [supporting] policies to make sure they can't continue to participate.”Mesidor, a Latina herself, was emotional as she spoke, as she feels that Democrats are missing one of the major narratives around Bitcoin and crypto. At the same time, she acknowledged why they might be apprehensive to look favorably upon the crypto industry.“Democrats have PTSD,” she told me in an interview after the panel.“[They have] PTSD because decades ago the predatory lenders, as we call them today, came to them and said we were going to democratize finance. The internet was supposed to democratize us, right? It was supposed to be decentralized. And today, big tech is not diverse,” she added.New York Assemblyman Clyde Vanel (D), a legislator who’s part of the New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic, and Asian Legislative Caucus, was also on the panel.Vanel recalled first being introduced to crypto in the mid-2010s and being impressed by how it catalyzed an increase in the financial savviness of inner city youth.“I went to different high schools and there were high school kids [who owned crypto] using the same muscles that seasoned investors do, watching markets,” recounted Vanel.“We had a convenience store in my neighborhood [that had a] Bitcoin ATM. I went to the convenience store and saw a line of young people buying different denominations of Bitcoin — amazing,” he added.Vanel wasn’t just happy to be seeing his constituents acquiring bitcoin because of the financial benefits they may have reaped from investing in it, but because blockchain technology also gives those from his community an alternative to the traditional financial system, which some — including his own father — don’t trust.“My dad never used a bank, never trusted a bank,” said Vanel. “He used check cashing places.”Vanel also touched on the remittance payment use case for Bitcoin and crypto.“When he sent money to another country, he spent a lot of money doing so,” said Vanel, still speaking about his father “What does it mean to make sure that we make it easier for people like him to transfer value?”Because Vanel understands well the benefits of Bitcoin and crypto, he’s glad to see Democrats starting to come around to it.“I’m very excited that this event is happening on the heels of this campaign to show the importance of financial inclusion [via] digital technology,” said Vanel. “10 years ago, this wouldn't have happened at the National Convention.”Not far from the event at which Mesidor and Vanel spoke, an event entitled CryptoDNC took place, featuring appearances by Reps. Bill Foster (D-IL) and the aforementioned Wiley Nickel.🎉 New speaker announcement!We're pleased to have @RepBillFoster as a featured speaker during our event next Wednesday in Chicago during the 2024 @DemConventionMake sure to RSVP now to secure your spot!Register: https://t.co/mJzVzchfx2Or sign up below 👇👇 pic.twitter.com/V9lnPlgmox— CryptoDNC (@crypto_dnc) August 16, 2024

During a fireside chat at the event, Rep. Nickel shared that not embracing crypto technology would be like not embracing the internet two and a half decades ago.Are The Democrats Serious?Have the Democrats really changed their tune regarding Bitcoin and crypto or are they just pandering to single-issue voters who would otherwise vote Trump because of his pro-crypto stance?This is the question that seems to have remained on the minds of most Bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts. Part of the reason many seem hesitant to trust the Democrats’ proposed 180 on crypto may be because of the Biden administration’s support of SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s regulation by enforcement approach to the crypto industry over the last three and a half years.Rep. Wiley Nickel seems to be making an earnest attempt to get the Democrats to “reset” their approach to crypto, but is Harris really listening? And can the likes of Assemblyman Vanel and Ms. Meridor raise their pro-crypto voices loudly enough to get the attention of a potential Harris administration?We will have to wait and see."
Crypto Potato,Michael Saylor Predicts Bitcoin Will Reach $13 Million Per Coin,"Mon, 09 Sep 2024 18:35:24 +0000",https://cryptopotato.com/michael-saylor-predicts-bitcoin-will-reach-13-million-per-coin/,The MicroStrategy chairman thinks Bitcoin will have long-term annual returns 8% higher than the S&#38;P500.,"MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor predicted on Monday that Bitcoin will reach $13 million over the next two decades.
The billionaire explained why the leading digital asset’s recent volatility hasn’t frightened his company, and the advantages for investors to buy into MSTR instead.
Bitcoin To $13 Million, Says Saylor
During an interview with CNBC, Saylor forecasted that Bitcoin will retain its 44% compound annual growth rate in the short term, before that growth steadily declines by roughly 5% per year as the asset matures.
“My long-term forecast is it’s going to go to $13 million over 21 years,” said Saylor. “At some point, it’ll be the S&P return plus 8%, and it’ll be the S&P vol plus 8%.”
To reach that price by 2045, Bitcoin would need to maintain an average CAGR of 29.56%.
Saylor initially put forward a similar price forecast during his speech at Bitcoin 2024 in Nashville. While $13 million was his “base case”, his “bear case” was $3 million (in line with VanEck’s predictions), and his bull case was a whopping $49 million – almost 1000X higher than today.
In the meantime, Saylor expects continued BTC volatility – largely because it is a globally traded, 24/7 asset that is highly liquid.
“If you’re worried about a missile strike, you can’t teleport your ten million dollar apartment to Singapore, lever it up 10 to 1, and short $100 million worth of New York real estate,” he explained. “But you can short $100 million worth of Bitcoin by borrowing $10 million.”
Regarding MicroStrategy (MSTR), Saylor argued that the company has “pioneered” the Bitcoin-backed bond market by issuing billions of dollars in convertible bonds to buy BTC.
As an investment, he says MSTR is like a “tax deferred” BTC yield” instrument, effectively letting users borrow money to buy BTC at rates they could not access as an individual. Since adopting a BTC reserve strategy in 2020
Peter Schiff Disapproves
Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff called out Saylor for boasting about the gains of both BTC and MSTR, calling his ideas “a bunch of nonsense.”
“MSTR is down 40% from its 52-week high and is 6% below its 2021 high. The actually returns are not nearly as rosy as you describe and will soon get worse,” he argued over Twitter on Monday.

DEFINITION:The number of unique addresses holding a positive (non-zero) amount of coins.
Bitcoin’s number of addresses with a non-zero balance has seen a steady increase in 2024. After a dip in early January, the total number of unique addresses began to recover around March, with notable growth from May through September — now nearing 53.2 million.
Despite fluctuations in price, which has dropped from around $70,000 to under $60,000 since March, user activity has maintained upward momentum.

Historically, the metric has shown consistent growth, reflecting long-term adoption trends. As shown in the second chart, the number of non-zero addresses has been on an upward trajectory since 2010, only briefly declining during major market corrections, such as the 2018 bear market. The continued rise in 2024 aligns with broader market patterns following Bitcoin’s halving event in April.

Hougan made the statement in response to a Sept. 8 social media post by researcher Jim Bianco, who claimed that less than 10% of US-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs AUM comes from investment advisors. He added that the ETFs are a “small tourist tool” instead of an adoption vehicle.
Nearly $1.5 billion from advisors
Hougan analyzed BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) net flows related to investment advisors, which are $1.45 billion. Compared to the total $46 billion in inflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs, Hougan agrees with Bianco that this is indeed a small amount.
However, excluding all other flows from Bitcoin ETFs and solely focusing on the $1.45 billion flow linked to investment advisors, Hougan explained that this would make IBIT the second fastest-growing ETF launched in 2024 out of over 300 funds.
He added:
“The only ETF that ‘beats’ it on assets is KLMT, an ESG ETF that was seeded by a single investor with $2 billion and trades on average ~250 shares per day, with zero investment advisor adoption.”
Hougan further highlighted that investment advisors are adopting Bitcoin ETFs faster than any other ETF in history despite the relatively lower amount invested compared to other investors.
Hougan added:
“It is just that their historic flows are overshadowed by the even-more-historic purchases of other investors.”
Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas agreed with the Bitwise CIO and confirmed that the nearly $1.5 billion in advisor allocations are “more organic inflows” than any other ETF launched this year.
Not too staggering
Jim Bianco’s post on X was prompted by the major outflows from US-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs registered last week. According to Farside Investors data, the ETFs collective lost $706 million last week, with nearly $288 million in fleeing capital registered on Sept. 3.
Balchunas noted that the major outflows represent 0.5% of Bitcoin ETFs’ total AUM, which he considers is not “too staggering.” The Bloomberg analyst added:
“[People] are so warped (err spoiled) by how big the inflows are that any little outflow they freak. Princess and the Pea Syndrome).”
Additionally, Balchunas explained that the correct way to measure an ETF’s health is by tracking its flows since dollar-denominated assets under management can shrink if the asset price goes down.
He concluded by highlighting that Bitcoin ETFs have over 1,000 institutional holders after two 13F periods, which he added is “beyond unprecedented.”
Balchunas added that 20% of IBIT’s shares are held by institutions and large advisors and expects this number to reach 40% in the next 12 months.

DEFINITION: The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) is computed by dividing the realized value (in USD) by the value at creation (USD) of a spent output. Or simply: price sold / price paid. 
Bitcoin’s 7-day moving average SOPR has fallen below 1.0, suggesting that a majority of spent outputs are being sold at a loss.
Historically, when SOPR drops below 1.0, it often reflects periods of market capitulation, as seen in early 2023 and late 2018. The recent decline comes despite the post-halving price stability between $25,000 to $30,000, signaling weakened market sentiment.
SOPR: (Source: Glassnode)
Comparing the current SOPR levels to prior cycles reveals similar patterns of investor behavior following major events. During these periods, SOPR tends to dip below 1.0 before market consolidation occurs, potentially paving the way for a price recovery.
The current decline parallels the bear market phases of 2018 and 2019, when prolonged periods of SOPR under 1.0 ultimately preceded a market reversal.

Venezuela’s Bitcoin mining crackdown appears to be continuing unabated, with the nation’s army seizing 35 rigs in a raid on a farm in Guárico. 
Despite President Nicolás Maduro’s recent comments about “returning” his country “to the crypto path,” police and army officials are continuing to hunt for illegal crypto miners.
Bitcoin Mining Rigs Taken Offline
In a tweet from the Strategic Command Operations of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (CEOFANB), officers said they seized 35 “devices for mining digital assets.” Soldiers also seized 30 “extractors” and several powerful electric fans.
The relevant military unit’s operational strategic commander, Domingo Hernández Lárez, said the miners “did not have permits or licenses” to carry out BTC mining “operations.”

The Venezuelan military has been dispatched to “disconnect” Bitcoin mining farms. The government says many miners use illegal National Electric System (SEN) connections.
Maduro’s government has claimed that illegal Bitcoin and altcoin miners are to blame for “recurring power outages” over the past few years.
The CEOFANBVE said it conducted its search in conjunction with Public Ministry officials. It said the miners had set up shop in a private house in the El Mirador District of the Juan Germán Roscio Nieves municipality.
Officers also said they had seized a Chevrolet and a Jeep. They published pictures of armed soldiers near the haul.

“Venezuela is a democratic state [with] a legal framework that regulates [crypto] mining activities. It has a registration system for [crypto] miners, crypto exchanges, and crypto-related services.”
Strategic Command Operations of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces
We Must Fight Threat to Power Grids – Gov’t
The Ministry of Electrical Energy has claimed that cutting illegal miners off from the grid will help lower pressure on networks.
The ministry said the crackdown would allow it to “continue offering efficient and reliable service to all Venezuelan citizens.”
Maduro recently claimed that a group of “bandits and thieves” had thwarted previous crypto adoption efforts in the country.

He told a group of Venezuelan business leaders that the country needed to “get back down” the crypto path.
At the height of the Venezuelan crypto push, the government ordered the army’s engineering core to mine BTC.
However, it seems soldiers have since been redeployed to fight illegal BTC miners. They began launching raids around the country last year.

10x Research cautions an aggressive U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut as a signal of economic worry, not reassurance, weighing over Bitcoin and other risk assets.
In a September 9th note to clients, 10x Research CEO Markus Thielen warned that the supposedly bullish liquidity easing cycle may kick off on a sour note for risk assets.
While a 25 basis point cut is seen as the more favorable outcome, possibly leading to long-term price appreciation for Bitcoin as liquidity increases and recession fears ease, a more aggressive cut could have an adverse effect.
A 50 basis point cut could “signal deeper concerns to the markets,” indicating a lapse in combating the impending economic slowdown. This might cause investors to reduce their exposure to risk assets like Bitcoin.
Something Thielen highlighted as no obstacle to the Fed’s decision, as their “primary focus will be mitigating economic risks rather than managing market reactions.”
While traders currently place the probability of a 50 basis point cut at 29%, according to CME’s fed watch tool, 10x Research cautions this, citing it to contrast their view of the “prevailing consensus.”
Weak Jobs Data Fuels Recession Fears
Recession concerns gained traction in early August when the Sahm Rule Recession Indicator, which tracks economic downturns, jumped to 0.53 from 0.43 following weak July U.S. jobs data, signaling a warning of a looming recession.
In the wake of the release of August’s weak jobs report, these fears have been exasperated. According to FRED data, the Sahm Rule Recession indicator has jumped higher to 0.57. 10x Research commented:

The chorus is growing louder that the Fed is behind the curve, having missed signs of labour market weakness after being caught off guard in July.

However, other analysts cite the weak jobs data as no obstacle. Alianza advisor and former Pimco CEO Mohamed El-Erian commented that the latest numbers remain consistent with his belief that the US economy will avoid a recession.

Especially after the excitement of a month ago, when analysts and economists suddenly jacked up their probability of an economic recession, this morning’s (August) US jobs report comes as a relief… that is unless you were absolutely convinced that the Federal Reserve would cut…— Mohamed A. El-Erian (@elerianm) September 6, 2024

Bitcoin Could Face a 20% Decline Under an Aggressive Rate Cut
In a September 2nd report from Bitfinex, analysts warned that a US rate cut could present a “challenging time” for Bitcoin traders.
A 50 basis point rate cut could potentially trigger a correction, pushing Bitcoin deeper into its recent slump as “recession concerns escalate.” The analysts added:

If we were to speculate, we would caution to expect a 15-20 percent decline when rates are cut this month, with a bottom of $40-50k for BTC

This view is consistent with past analysis from 10x Research, which identified the low 40,000s zone as an optimal entry point for the next bull market.
Although Bitcoin price action may appear bleak in the near term, Based on historical and technical patterns, a six-figure bitcoin Bitcoin is “still in play.”
Popular trader Titan of Crypto pointed to the final quarter of this year as a potential breakout point, describing it as having “epic” potential for price action—a sentiment echoed by other analysts.

Over the past 24 hours, the XRP price has managed to keep its head above water despite a retracement, standing at a 0.66% gain. Meanwhile, one analyst has come up with an interesting comparison, claiming that XRP is in for a “huge squeeze.”
This speculation comes despite XRP still reeling from losses since Monday, down 5.29% – a notable weakness compared to other altcoins that have mounted recoveries.
Despite these setbacks, trader interest in XRP appears to be increasing. The altcoin’s trading volume has surged 25.23% to $615 million over the past 24 hours
XRP Price to Squeeze Against Bitcoin: Is a Breakout Imminent?

In a September 8th X post, popular trader Crypto Michael highlighted a “huge squeeze” forming on the XRP/BTC price chart.

XRP/BTC looks ready for a huge squeeze pic.twitter.com/O0lzuHbTCZ— Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) September 8, 2024

This observation is supported by an ascending triangle pattern that has developed since mid-July, characterized by higher lows as the asset price converges towards stubborn resistance as it approaches a breakout.
In an X post the day prior, the analyst pointed to the resistance at $0.55 as a target, overcoming which would lead the XRP price to “pump hard.” 
A closer look at the XRP/USDT chart indicates that this move might be approaching.
XRP/USDT 1H chart, falling wedge pattern. Source: Binance.
XRP is currently confined within a falling wedge pattern, reflecting growing volatility as the asset navigates a period marked by fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). As the asset unwinds its selling pressure, this pattern converges toward a potential breakout point.
However, momentum indicators now appear more favorable. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has managed to maintain its position in positive territory, currently at 60. Although still neutral, it represents a shift towards bullishness.
Likewise, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has emerged out of its recent rut, now at +0.1. Buying pressure has taken the edge, making a potential breakout promising.
Indeed, as the MACD line holds above the Signal line after a recent cross above it, it seems that the bulls are leading XRP’s next move.
Fundamentals also lean in XRP’s favor. Most significantly, Ripple announced that their stablecoin will likely launch this year. If it meets widespread adoption, it may serve as a catalyst for price action.
However, traders should look for a decisive break above the resistance presented by the 200EMA for confirmation of a breakout from this pattern before a move to $0.55.
This New Opportunity Has Higher Gains Potential
Although some may want to cling to XRP for further gains, admittedly, XRP’s performance has been shaky throughout the year. Relying solely on XRP may limit your potential gains.
Therefore, more strategic investors may find an advantage in diversifying into newer low-cap meme coins that have the potential to rally exponentially. 
Specifically, Crypto All-Stars ($STARS)  presents a unique opportunity by pioneering the industry’s first meme coin staking platform.

Could this accumulation signal a major BTC price surge? Read the latest analysis and insights.The postBitcoin Price Analysis: Whales Scoop Up $227M in BTC – Is a Surge Coming?appeared first onCryptonews.,"
Bitcoin (BTC) has regained momentum, climbing above $55,500 after a recent dip. According to Lookonchain, the recovery follows increased buying from crypto whales, suggesting renewed confidence in Bitcoin’s future growth.

Lookonchain reports that there has been a big increase in Bitcoin (BTC) following a major drop in the market last week. Starting on Sept. 1, three big players in the crypto space collectively amassed a whopping 2,814 BTC, which is equivalent to $157.3 million.#Bitcoin #Crypto pic.twitter.com/cU1rbCKwaM— CoinWave (@CoinWaveBTC) September 9, 2024

Additionally, the recent US jobs report for August, which showed fewer jobs added than expected, supports this recovery. The report reduces the likelihood of a 50-basis-point rate cut, though a 25-basis-point cut remains possible. 
This has sparked interest in Bitcoin, as lower rate hike expectations could drive investors toward cryptocurrencies.
Key Points:

Bitcoin rebounds above $55,500 after whale buying activity.
Weaker US jobs report reduces chances of a 50-basis-point rate cut.
Investors see Bitcoin as a hedge against slower Federal Reserve rate hikes.

Bitcoin Recovers as Whale Buys and Economic Data Boost Confidence
Crypto whales have recently purchased over 4,014 BTC, valued at $227 million, during Bitcoin’s 11% price drop. Notable transactions include a 999.999 BTC withdrawal from Binance, worth around $55 million. 
Historically, such whale activity signals confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value and often precedes a market recovery.

Crypto Whales Continue to Buy the Dip, Scooping Up $227 Million in Bitcoin https://t.co/AT1J9RNmEn— ZoneCrypto Feed (@ZoneCrypto_feed) September 9, 2024

Key Points:

Whales buy over 4,000 BTC amid an 11% price drop.
Bitcoin recovers 4%, now trading around $55,000.
Weaker US jobs data fuels interest in Bitcoin as an alternative asset.

Bitcoin has since rebounded 4% to around $55,000, prompting some investors to close short positions. Additionally, the weaker-than-expected US jobs report has reduced the likelihood of aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts, making alternative assets like Bitcoin more appealing.
This renewed interest in Bitcoin, driven by whale activity and favorable economic factors, could lead to further price increases.
Bitcoin’s Price Could Surge Amid Institutional Confidence and U.S. Election
Institutional investors are regaining confidence in Bitcoin (BTC), with many believing the market has bottomed out. QCP Capital analysts note that investors are positioning for long-term gains, particularly focusing on March 2025. 
Despite recent volatility and short-term uncertainties, optimism for a market recovery remains strong.
The upcoming U.S. presidential election in 2024 could also have a significant impact on Bitcoin’s price. A Donald Trump victory could push BTC to $90,000 due to his perceived support for pro-cryptocurrency policies.
In contrast, a win by Kamala Harris may cause a drop to $30,000–$40,000, as her stance on digital assets is less clear, raising regulatory concerns.
Key Points:

Institutional investors are targeting 2025 for long-term Bitcoin gains.
Bitcoin’s price could surge to $90,000 if Trump wins the 2024 election.
Market volatility remains high due to political and economic events.

These factors, combined with institutional optimism, suggest potential for significant Bitcoin price movement.
Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Daily Technical Outlook – September 9
Bitcoin is currently trading at $55,422, showing a modest gain of 0.28% for the day. However, the cryptocurrency continues to face a challenging technical landscape as it approaches significant resistance near the $55,800 level. 
This resistance is marked by a downward trendline that has been extending from recent highs, combined with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $56,198. 
Together, these technical levels are exerting pressure on Bitcoin, making it difficult for the asset to break higher. Unless Bitcoin can decisively move above $55,807, the bearish sentiment is likely to persist in the short term.

 #Bitcoin Daily Technical Outlook (Sept 9):BTC is trading at $55,422, up 0.28%, but facing strong resistance at $55,800. The 50-day EMA ($56,198) and downward trendline are capping gains. Immediate support at $53,636. Bearish bias persists without a breakout. #BTC #Crypto pic.twitter.com/JCBM4i2Kw6— Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) September 9, 2024

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 51.65, indicating neutral momentum. While the RSI has climbed from oversold conditions earlier this week, it remains unclear whether Bitcoin has enough strength to sustain a rally. 
Immediate resistance stands at $55,807, and should Bitcoin manage to break above this level, the next targets lie at $57,277 and $58,491. Failure to clear these key thresholds could result in continued selling pressure.

On the downside, Bitcoin finds immediate support at $53,636. Should the price fall below this level, additional support can be found at $52,570 and $51,222. 
If these supports are breached, the market may witness a deeper correction, potentially bringing the price down toward the $50,000 psychological mark.
Given the current technical setup, the 50-day EMA and the downward trendline are acting as formidable barriers, preventing Bitcoin from sustaining any upward momentum. 
The bearish bias will likely remain unless there is a clear breakout above $55,800.

Speakers including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, ConSensys CEO Joseph Lubin, and Congressman Wiley Nickel (D-NC) addressed the maximum capacity crowd at the Black Cat music venue. The speakers largely agreed on one idea: the importance of supporting cryptocurrency in America through a concerted bipartisan effort.In their shared stage appearance, Brian Armstrong and Congressman Nickel noted that they see it as critical to keep and foster cryptocurrency innovation in America. This importance, for Nickel in particular, is not so solely founded on a belief in the technology, but is ostensibly due to the fact that 20% of American adults own some form of cryptocurrency, a voting block that Nickel thinks “[has] the ability to sway elections.”Nickel added: “If we want to do things in Washington, it’s critically important that we do it in a bipartisan way. If we politicize the issue with one party going into crypto versus another, it’s going to poison the well in Washington for a decade.”Since Biden took office in 2020, his administration’s SEC, DoJ and DoE (Department of Energy) officials have introduced a fair amount of unwelcome regulatory hurdles. Notably, Nickel’s support of cryptocurrency does signal a change of tune for the historically hostile Democratic Party.“I started coming to DC five years ago, and when I first came here, most people didn’t know what crypto even was,” said Armstrong. “One member of Congress asked me: ‘Isn’t this all some video game or something like that?’ Once they figured out what crypto was over the years, the conversation totally shifted. Now, everybody knows what crypto is, we’re kind of the belle of the ball, the hot topic on everyone’s lips.”However, one attendee, an executive at a prominent financial institution who wished to remain anonymous, reflected on the development of crypto-politicking and what they see as under-commitment on the part of the Democratic Party.In particular, the executive believes that the Biden administration’s veto of legislation overturning SAB 121, which if signed would have allowed highly regulated financial institutions to custody digital assets, was a major wake-up call.They remarked that the crypto industry, despite raising large amounts of money for campaign contributions, still carries a strong stigma and that policymakers don’t offer the respect this single-issue voter bloc deserves.The America Loves Crypto tour had been focused on addressing the stigma with a mixture of live music and grassroots community building. Alex Pall and Drew Taggart, otherwise known as The Chainsmokers, closed out the event, entertaining the crowd with their classic hits, unreleased music, and most notably a cry of “F$*# Gary Gesnler”. The Chainsmokers themselves are no strangers to cryptocurrency and founded the tech and crypto-focused Mantis Venture Capital fund in 2020.With stops in Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C., many in attendance on the America Loves Crypto tour were hopeful that more than 1.4 million Stand With Crypto advocates nationwide can flex their muscle as a true deciding factor in November."
Bitcoin Magazine,Hut 8 and BITMAIN To Launch Next-Generation ASIC Bitcoin Miner with Liquid-to-Chip Cooling,"Thu, 19 Sep 2024 20:26:27 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/hut-8-and-bitmain-to-launch-next-generation-asic-bitcoin-miner-with-liquid-to-chip-cooling,"These mining giants join forces to release the U3S21EXPH, a next-generation ASIC miner featuring advanced liquid-to-chip cooling technology.","Hut 8 Corp. (Nasdaq | TSX: HUT), a leading Bitcoin mining company, has expanded its partnership with BITMAIN Technologies Ltd., the world’s largest producer of Bitcoin mining servers, to launch the U3S21EXPH, a next-generation ASIC miner. This model will be the first mass-commercialized miner to feature direct liquid-to-chip (DLC) cooling within a U form factor.Hut 8 plans to deploy the new miner in the second quarter of 2025, with an initial hosting agreement handling approximately 15 exahash per second (EH/s). This hosting deployment, facilitated by custom-built data center infrastructure developed in-house by Hut 8, is a key part of the company’s strategy to expand its computing power across Bitcoin mining and AI compute sectors.“Our partnership with BITMAIN has allowed us to advance our thinking on ASIC compute and create a more scalable model for data center design as we expand our footprint,” said Asher Genoot, CEO of Hut 8. “The U3S21EXPH will be the first miner from BITMAIN broadly commercialized with DLC cooling within a U form factor, making it rack-ready like traditional data center hardware. This innovation bridges critical engineering gaps between Bitcoin mining and AI data center infrastructure in both form factor and cooling technology, and we believe this convergence will enable us to unlock significant synergies and flexibility going forward.”The U3S21EXPH can achieve an efficiency of 13 joules per terahash, producing up to 860 terahash. It uses DLC cooling, a technology traditionally reserved for high-performance computing (HPC) data centers, to make Bitcoin mining more energy efficient and scalable.""Asher and Mike have been invaluable thought partners to BITMAIN since the early days of US Bitcoin Corp, where they demonstrated a unique focus on cost-efficient procurement and operations,” said Irene Gao, Vice President of Mining at BITMAIN. “Hut 8’s technical expertise, operating strength, and track record of innovation made this partnership a natural evolution of our relationship as we began the journey of developing next-generation ASIC technology.”The commercial agreement between Hut 8 and BITMAIN includes a fixed hosting fee and a purchase option for Hut 8 to buy the hosted machines in up to three tranches. This structure allows Hut 8 to assess market conditions before making further investments, minimizing financial risk. If Hut 8 exercises this purchase option, its self-mining capacity could grow from 5.6 EH/s to 20.6 EH/s.

Bitcoin Magazine,Celebrating 10 Years of the Hardware Wallet Revolution,"Thu, 19 Sep 2024 16:01:04 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/celebrating-10-years-of-the-hardware-wallet-revolution-,A look back at the start of hardware wallets in the Bitcoin space. ,"As we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first hardware wallet, it's remarkable to see how far Bitcoin security has come. From the early days of precarious self-custody methods to the game-changing creation of the Trezor Model One, this revolution has transformed the way we protect our digital assets. With a decade of this experience behind us, it’s worth revisiting the challenges of early Bitcoin self-custody, the pivotal impact of the first hardware wallet, the essential role of self-custody in today's Bitcoin landscape, and the innovative advancements continuing to shape the future of crypto security.The Origin StoryIt all began in 2011 when Marek “Slush” Palatinus logged onto his mining pool server and discovered 3,000 BTC were missing. A mining pool is a collective of miners who combine their computational resources to increase their chances of successfully mining Bitcoin blocks. Slushpool, now known as Braiins Pool, was the pioneering mining pool in the Bitcoin community, established in 2010.This incident highlighted a significant issue: even tech-savvy Bitcoin enthusiasts could fall victim to online attacks. At that time, securing and managing Bitcoin was a daunting task, involving storing private keys on a computer. However, securing information on a computer is difficult; these complex machines are vulnerable to many threats that allow thieves to steal private keys controlling Bitcoin. The hack that cost Palatinus 3,000 BTC was a reminder of these early vulnerabilities.Recognizing a pressing need for a simple, stand-alone device that could securely store Bitcoin, Slush, along with Pavol “Stick” Rusnák, embarked on creating the world’s first hardware wallet. Their vision was to develop an offline computer specifically designed to store Bitcoin securely and make it accessible to non-technical users. The concept was straightforward yet revolutionary: a small, single-purpose device that would keep private keys in an isolated environment, protected from online threats.Before Hardware WalletsBefore hardware wallets became widely available, users had to rely on software wallets installed on computers or smartphones, which exposed them to a range of security threats. Malware infections and other attacks were common. Paper wallets were considered more secure but still required a computer to create the wallet. More secure methods, such as using air-gapped computers for cold storage, required significant technical expertise, and even these methods lacked an adequate level of security for larger amounts of Bitcoin.The usability of early Bitcoin wallets was also a significant issue, with clunky interfaces and complicated backup processes. Many users failed to back up their wallets properly, leading to permanent loss of funds if a device was lost or damaged. Users were frequently unaware of best practices for backups, and the lack of standardized backup methods further increased the risk. A major improvement in backup standardization came with the introduction of Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets with BIP32 in 2012, allowing for easier and more reliable backups. Despite these advancements, there was still a lack of easy and user-friendly options for newcomers. In short, the period before Hardware Wallets was marked by significant security and usability challenges, making Bitcoin self-custody a complex and risky endeavor.The First Hardware WalletIn the years leading up to 2014, various attempts were made to develop simple, single-purpose devices for cryptocurrency storage. However, these efforts failed to gain traction or meet the necessary security standards. Recognizing the need for a robust solution, Slush and Stick monitored the landscape for two years before they finally decided to create their own hardware wallet.In 2014, they released the Trezor Model One. This device was the first ever hardware wallet, combining user-friendly design, truly random private key generation, and the ability to easily sign transactions completely offline. In addition, it implemented the BIP39 standard, a new standard created by the Trezor creators to back up wallets using a list of 24 words representing the private keys, a standard adopted by many wallets and familiar to anyone who has put their Bitcoin in self-custody.When the user first connects the device, it guides them through the setup process to create a new wallet. The device generates a recovery seed, which represents a human-readable version of the wallet’s master private key and enables wallet recovery in case of device malfunction. The user is prompted to write down this list of words on a piece of paper, ensuring the wallet is backed up, and the private keys remain offline.This onboarding process ensures that users create a backup and keep it secure. The user-friendly design offers advanced security, making hardware wallets accessible to both beginners and experienced users.The Open Source AdvantageA key aspect of Bitcoin is its commitment to open-source principles, and that's why the founders of Trezor adhered to the same principles when developing the Trezor Model One. This approach has been adopted by most manufacturers in the industry. Open-source software allows the community to audit and verify a system's integrity. This transparency ensures that potential vulnerabilities can be identified and addressed promptly and allows improvement by the global community. The first hardware wallet was open source, and many in the industry have embraced this approach for transparency, emphasizing the Bitcoin ethos, ""Don't trust; verify.”The Importance of Self-CustodyThroughout Bitcoin's life, we have seen many crypto exchanges and custodians collapse or suffer severe security breaches, showing the importance of holding your private keys. The mantra ""not your keys, not your coins"" emphasizes that relying on third-party institutions means trusting someone else with your assets, which can lead to big problems if the exchange gets hacked, mismanaged, or faces legal issues.The Mt. Gox incident in 2014, one of the earliest and most notable exchange collapses, saw the loss of 850,000 Bitcoins, valued at hundreds of millions of dollars at the time. This catastrophic failure was due to both hacking and mismanagement, leaving users unable to recover their funds. Bitfinex also suffered a significant hack in 2016, resulting in the theft of nearly 120,000 Bitcoins. QuadrigaCX in 2019 saw users losing access to their funds after the sudden death of its founder, who was the only one with the keys to the exchange's wallets. Cryptopia faced a debilitating hack in 2019, and Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, has also experienced breaches and faces increasing regulatory scrutiny. More recently, the FTX collapse in 2022 further reinforced the dangers of entrusting assets to centralized entities. Overall, mismanagement and fraudulent activities led to the loss of billions, impacting countless users and shaking confidence in centralized exchanges.By using hardware wallets, individuals can achieve true financial independence, keeping their digital assets safe from the vulnerabilities of trusted custodians.The Evolving Landscape of Hardware WalletsOver the past decade, the hardware wallet industry has greatly expanded, with many companies offering a variety of products and features to meet different needs. User interfaces now range from simple button-based navigation to touchscreens and full keyboards. Many devices now support multiple cryptocurrencies, while some focus exclusively on Bitcoin. This range of devices caters to both beginners and advanced users, ensuring everyone can find a suitable option.Another advancement has been the inclusion of secure elements—specialized chips designed to protect devices from physical attacks. However, all secure elements currently available on the market are closed-source, which raises transparency concerns. To address this issue, companies like Tropic Square are actively working on developing open-source secure elements to enhance trust and security.Other significant advancements in the industry aim to enhance the security and robustness of wallet backups. Techniques such as Shamir's Secret Sharing, Multisignature Wallets, and SeedXOR allow users to remove single points of failure, making it significantly more difficult for thieves to compromise the wallet. Looking ahead, we can expect more improvements in hardware wallet security and usability. One notable development is the wider implementation of a new enhanced standard, SLIP39, which uses Shamir's Secret Sharing. This method is becoming preferred over the traditional BIP39 standard due to its enhanced security and user-friendliness. With SLIP39, users start with a single list of words to back up their wallet and can later upgrade to a ""sharded"" backup with multiple shares. This approach provides a flexible and highly secure solution, making advanced security measures more accessible and practical for a wider range of users.Looking Forward to the Next DecadeAs we celebrate the first Hardware Wallet, it's clear that this revolution has fundamentally transformed cryptocurrency security. From humble beginnings as a hobby project to becoming a trusted name in the industry, Trezor has pioneered innovations that have empowered countless individuals to take control of their financial future. The journey from the first prototypes to the sophisticated devices that we now use today is a testament to the vision and dedication of the Trezor team.With the continuous evolution of Hardware Wallet functionality and a commitment to security and transparency, the future looks promising. As we look forward to the next decade, the industry remains dedicated to securing and innovating Bitcoin security and usability, ensuring that self-custody becomes increasingly accessible and secure for all.This is a guest post by Josef Tetek.

Dr. Fleming, described this initiative as a crucial step in modernizing government operations, stating, “In today's digital age, government systems must evolve and embrace new technologies. By introducing cryptocurrency as a payment option, we're not just innovating; we're providing our citizens with flexibility and freedom in interacting with state services.”The Bitcoin payments will be converted into U.S. dollars by Bead Pay, a provider specializing in cryptocurrency conversion for government transactions. “The State of Louisiana will not handle cryptocurrency,” clarified the announcement. This system aims to ensure that the state is protected from the volatility commonly associated with digital currencies. The conversion process mirrors that of credit or debit card payments, minimizing risks while offering secure, efficient transactions.Louisiana's shift to accepting Bitcoin is a part of a broader effort to integrate new technologies into public services. “I have been proud to author several bills related to digital assets and to Chair the State Treasurer's task force in 2022,” said Louisiana State Representative Mark Wright. “I'm excited to see Louisiana further expanding its payment options under Treasurer Fleming. I look forward to working with him and others so that Louisiana will continue to be a leader in accepting digital payments.”Louisiana expects the new payment options to reduce fraud and enhance overall transaction security. Residents can now use their private Bitcoin wallets to pay for services, while the state continues to receive payments in U.S. dollars.The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries was the first state agency to adopt the new payment system, with more departments expected to follow. “Offering our sportsmen more ways to interact with our department allows for us to enhance our customer service,” stated Secretary Madison Sheahan of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. “This is another step towards our goal of creating a modern and professional organization that better serves the sportsmen of the state.”"

It even comes with a massive pre-mine of 50% of the supply being split between an “ecosystem treasury”, a pre-sale, advisors, grants for the community, and developers. This is essentially the equivalent of the entire first halving period of Bitcoin when the block subsidy was 50 BTC per block. From here the network jumps to 25 Fractal Bitcoin (FB) per block. Secondly, there is no peg mechanism for moving actual bitcoin into the “sidechain.” Yes, you read that correctly. They are framing themselves as a sidechain/layer two, but there is no actual mechanism to move your bitcoin back and forth between the mainchain and “the sidechain” Fractal Bitcoin. It is a completely independent system with no actual ability to move funds back and forth. One of the core aspects of a sidechain is the ability to peg, or “lock,” your bitcoin from the mainchain and move it into a sidechain system so that you can make use of it there, eventually moving those funds back to the mainchain. Fractal Bitcoin has no such mechanism, and not only that, the discussion around the topic in their “technical litepaper” is completely incoherent. They discuss Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) as a mechanism for “bridging” between different levels of Fractal sidechains. DLCs are not a suitable mechanism for a peg at all. DLCs function by pre-defining where coins will be sent based on a signature from an oracle or a set of oracles expected at a given time. They are used for gambling, financial products such as derivatives, etc. between two parties. DLCs are not designed to allow funds to be sent to any arbitrary place based on the outcome of the contract, they are designed to allocate funds to one of two participants, or proportionally to each participant, based on the outcome of some contract or event that an oracle signs off on. This is not suitable for a sidechain or other system peg, which is ideally architected to allow any current owner of coins in the sidechain or second layer system to freely send coins to any destination they choose so long as they have valid control over them on the other system. So not only is there no functional peg mechanism for the live system, but their hand waving about potential designs for one in their litepaper is just completely incoherent. The whole “design” is a clown show designed to pump bags for pre-mine holders. “Cadence” MiningAnother troubling aspect of the system is its variation on merge mining, Cadence mining. The network utilizes SHA256 as the hashing algorithm, and it does support conventional Namecoin style merge mining. But there is a catch. Only one third of the blocks produced on the network are capable of being produced by Bitcoin miners engaged in merge mining. The other two thirds must be mined conventionally by miners switching their hashrate entirely over to Fractal Bitcoin. This is a poisonous incentive structure. It essentially tries to associate itself with the Bitcoin network calling itself a “merge mined system”, when in reality two thirds of the block production mandates turning hashrate away from securing the Bitcoin network and devoting it exclusively to securing Fractal Bitcoin. Most of the reward is not capturable by miners who continue mining Bitcoin, and the greater the value of FB the greater the incentive for Bitcoin miners to defect and begin mining it instead of bitcoin to increase the share of the FB reward they capture. It essentially functions as an incentive distortion for Bitcoin miners proportional to the value of the overall system. It also offers no advantage in terms of security at all. By forcing this choice it guarantees that most of the network difficulty must remain low enough that whatever small portion of miners find it profitable to defect from Bitcoin to FB can mine blocks at the targeted 30 second block interval. Conventional merge mining would allow the entire mining network to contribute security without having to deal with the opportunity cost of not mining Bitcoin. What’s The Point of This?The ostensible point of the network is to facilitate things like DeFi and Ordinals, that consume large amounts of blockspace, by giving them a system to utilize other than the mainchain. The problem with this logic is the reason those systems are built on the mainchain in the first place is because people value the immutability and security that it provides. Nothing about the architecture of Fractal Bitcoin provides the same security guarantees. Even if they did, there is no functional pegging mechanism at all to facilitate these assets from being interoperable between the mainchain and the Fractal Bitcoin chain. The entire system is a series of handwaves past important technical details to rush something to market that allows insiders to profit off of the pre-mine involved in the launch. No peg mechanism, an incoherent “merge mining” scheme that not only creates a poisonous incentive distortion should it continue rising in value, but actually guarantees a lower level of proof of work security, and a bunch of buzzwords. It does have CAT active, but so do testnets in existence. So even the argument as a testing ground for things built using CAT is just incoherent and a half assed rationalization for a pre-mined token pump. Calling this a sidechain, or a layer of Bitcoin, is beyond ridiculous. It’s a token scheme, pure and simple. "

According to the Federal Reserve’s official statement, recent economic activity indicators show good growth, but job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has slightly risen. While inflation has made progress toward the Committee's 2% target, it remains somewhat elevated. The rate cut is part of the Fed’s strategy to balance maximum employment with price stability in the face of economic uncertainties.The Fed said that this rate reduction aligns with their commitment to achieving sustainable inflation control while supporting growth in the job market. The Committee will continue monitoring economic developments and adjusting its monetary policy to mitigate risks that could impede its goals. In addition to rate cuts, the Fed will maintain its policy of reducing holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed assets.This decision reflects the Federal Reserve’s approach in navigating a challenging economic landscape, balancing growth and inflation targets while remaining vigilant about potential risks that may emerge in the future. Markets will now look to how this policy shift affects broader financial conditions and future rate decisions.While this rate cut is aimed at supporting economic growth and stabilizing inflation, it could also have positive implications for Bitcoin. Lower interest rates tend to reduce the appeal of traditional assets like bonds and savings accounts, prompting investors to seek alternative investments with higher potential returns in a low-interest-rate environment, like BTC. Historically, rate cuts have contributed to increased liquidity in financial markets, potentially fueling demand for Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio.JUST IN: #Bitcoin hits $61,000 at Fed cuts rates for first time in 4 years 🚀 pic.twitter.com/YympBNbC5E— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 18, 2024

This sets a new transparency standard for the industry after recent failures of exchanges like FTX shook consumer trust.River CEO Alex Leishman stated, ""River Proof of Reserves is about more than verifying our balances; it's about reinforcing River's commitment to integrity and long-term client trust."" He added, ""Our goal is to build unshakable trust with our clients. Proof of Reserves is the gold standard for Bitcoin custody.""The new feature allows clients to independently confirm that River holds their Bitcoin in full reserve multi-sig cold storage. River currently secures over $800 million worth of Bitcoin for its clients. According to Leishman, ""We're leading by example by proving every month that your Bitcoin is exactly where we say it is."" After recent failures, he encouraged the industry to adopt similar transparency standards to rebuild trust.The added transparency also prevents fractional reserve practices from destabilising fiat currencies and leading to bank failures.

This was the first time the two made a public appearance together since the US Department of Justice (DoJ) charged the two developers with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business in April 2024. It was also the first time either of them have appeared in court since Hill appeared ahead of his bail release in July and Rodriguez first attended a court hearing in May.The prosecution addressed the court first, stating that it had produced “voluminous batches of discovery.”It made the first batch available to the defense in mid-June 2024. This batch featured business records, emails and social media account information amongst other data.The second batch, which it made available to the defense in mid-August 2024, featured data extractions from the devices that the DoJ seized from the two developers. The DoJ has extracted information from 15 of the 44 devices seized from Rodriguez and 25 of the 27 devices seized from Hill.The prosecution also stated that it would produce a third batch of discovery containing a “relatively modest” amount of data soon and that it was prepared to proceed with trial.No Evidence Of Money TransmissionRodriguez’s attorney made the case that it was premature to set a trial date, as the defense has yet to review all of the discovery made available in mid-August 2024. The defense also said that it has yet to come across any evidence showing that Rodriguez or Hill operated an unlicensed money transmitting business.Hill’s attorney stated that they’ve received 8 terabytes worth of discovery. To put this amount of data in context, he explained that this was the equivalent of 75% of the amount of information in the Library of Congress and that, if one printed this information, one could stack the paper it was printed on “to the moon and back 22 times,” making the point that it would be hard to sort through and review.Hill’s attorney also referenced the letter from Senators Cynthia Lummis (R) and Ron Wyden (D) in which the lawmakers stated that the DoJ’s unprecedented interpretation of the US Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) statute regarding operating an unlicensed money transmitting business contradicts the intent of the rule. For this reason, he proposed a motion to dismiss the charge.The judge denied this request and scheduled a follow-up hearing for December 17, 2024 at 10 AM ET.Rodriguez’s Request For Bail ModificationsIn the second portion of the conference, Rodriguez’s lawyer requested two modifications to Rodriguez’s bail conditions. He requested that the court remove Rodriguez's home detention mandate and that the court modify restrictions on Rodriguez’s ability to transact with cryptocurrency, some of which was proceeds from Samourai. (Zack Shapiro, Legal Fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute (BPI) later explained to me that the second modification was requested in part so that Rodriguez could use bitcoin proceeds from Samourai to pay for legal fees.)Rodriguez’s attorney argued that home detention was “unduly restrictive” and “unnecessary,” and that Rodriguez isn’t a flight risk. The defense also cited two instances in which Rodriguez had the opportunity to flee but didn’t in its efforts to make the case that Rodriguez no longer needed to wear a location monitoring device.The prosecution pushed back, arguing that Rodriguez’s home detention was necessary to ensure that Rodriguez continued to appear for trial. It also stated that the charges being levied against Rodriguez for running a “cryptocurrency money laundering business” were severe and that Rodriguez was potentially facing a potential sentence of up to 25 years.The prosecution went on to cite evidence from handwritten pages that it had obtained from Rodriguez’s home containing details about how he would flee the country to a jurisdiction from which it would be difficult to extradite him. This information included a list including different passports as well as having $10,000 in cash, a burner phone, an unused SIM card, and various mnemonic phrases for crypto assets amongst other items.Rodriguez’s lawyer argued that this plan applied to what Rodriguez would do in the case of a more general emergency, while the prosecution argued that this was Rodriguez’s current escape plan.The prosecution stated that it was “a pretty good plan” and that it doesn’t feel that it’s appropriate to stop monitoring Rodriguez at this time. However, the prosecution did say that it would consider allowing Rodriguez certain freedoms if petitioned, without including any specifics.The judge didn’t allow for the modification of the bail conditions and asked both the prosecution and the defense to “get moving on the case.”Donate to the legal defense fund for Rodriguez and Hill via BPI’s P2P Rights Fund."
Bitcoin Magazine,Key Battleground State Pennsylvania Hosts Day Five of the America Loves Crypto Tour,"Tue, 17 Sep 2024 16:34:57 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/key-battleground-state-pennsylvania-hosts-day-five-of-the-america-loves-crypto-tour,"Residents of Pennsylvania, a key US swing state in the upcoming US Presidential election, come out in support of a pro-Bitcoin and pro-crypto future for the United States.","On a cool autumn evening in Philadelphia, PA, more than just crypto bros showed up in The City of Brotherly Love to show their support for Bitcoin and crypto on the fifth stop on the America Loves Crypto tour. A diverse crowd of approximately 200, split evenly between men and women, filled Vinyl, a stylish venue in the heart of the city where the event was hosted. The size and enthusiasm of the crowds on this tour has grown considerably as it has rolled on, lending some credence to the notion that the crypto voting block may play a role in swaying major races in US elections come November.The speakers on this tour date included former US Senator and member of Coinbase’s Global Advisory Board Pat Toomey (R); former Congressman Patrick Murphy (D), Kara Calvert, Head of US Policy at Coinbase; Dominic Folino, President of the Pennsylvania Blockchain Coalition; David Johnson, General Council and Strategic Advisor at The Giving Block; Cody Eddings, co-founder and CEO of Snap Refund; and Sam Weinrott, co-founder of PizzaDAO. Electronic pop artist Lauv headlined the event.The theme at the event was that Pennsylvanians, 1.4 million of which are crypto owners, have a big role to play if they want to help move the US in a more pro-crypto direction. Pennsylvania is one of the seven swing states that will likely decide the outcome of the US Presidential election in November, and it’s the one with the most electoral votes: 19. Given that the number of that state’s residents who own crypto is 18 times the vote differential between President Biden and former President Trump in the 2020 Presidential election, it’s imperative that pro-Bitcoin and pro-crypto Pennsylvanians vote, which the speakers at this event made clear.Former Politicians Urge Pro-Crypto Pennsylvanians To VoteAs one of the first speakers at the event, Toomey, a long-term crypto advocate, set the tone for the evening, calling on voters to vote anti-crypto politicians out of office.“My former colleagues have not been able to get legislation across the goal line [and] an out of control Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] is casting a dark shadow over all kinds of crypto development,” began Toomey from the stage.“The growth of this whole sector should be happening in the United States of America. We've got the head start. We've got the tremendous entrepreneurship. We've got the infrastructure. But, increasingly, some of the most talented people in our country are leaving because there are jurisdictions overseas that have provided legal clarity about this,” he added.“There are some folks in Congress on both sides of the aisle that are very in favor of allowing crypto to really develop and thrive. And there are others who are very hostile. My suggestion: some of the hostiles need to lose an election.”Murphy brought a similar energy, as he highlighted the importance of Bitcoin and crypto as well as Pennsylvanians’ role as voters to protect it.“The whole point of crypto is the fact that we don't have to rely on a government or a central bank,” said Murphy, making the point that we can use the technology to control our own destiny.He then seconded Toomey’s call to action regarding voting anti-crypto politicians out of office.“He was absolutely right when he said there's people that are not for us, and we should hold them accountable,” said Murphy.To do so, Murphy hammered home the point that Pennsylvania voters have a key role to play in this election.“There are only really six states that are going to control this election, [and] Pennsylvania [is one with] 19 electoral votes,” said Murphy. “So, we have an incredibly important voice, but only if we use it.”Founders Ask For Clear Crypto RulesFollowing the talks from Toomey and Murphy was a founders panel featuring Johnson, Folino, Eddings and Weinrott.Much like what was discussed on a panel on the first stop on the tour, the founders present asked for little more than clear rules of the road for crypto from the US regulatory apparatus.“Being compliant in crypto right now in the US is incredibly hard because, as much as you want to follow the rules, it’s not always clear what the rules are,” said Johnson. “Too many folks in Washington either don’t understand the technology, don’t care to understand it, or, in many cases, unfortunately, are hostile to it. The reality is innovators are gonna innovate, whether it’s here or somewhere else,” he added.

Founders share their thoughts on crypto regulation in the US.

“We know that crypto is the future of payments, and the reason we’re out here supporting this is that we want that to happen in the US, not elsewhere.”Folino chimed in, sharing his thoughts on the roadblocks preventing the crypto industry from flourishing in the US.“Politicians, regulation and one Senator whose name we all know I think is a real big reason why we’re not moving forward,” said Folino, presumably referring to Senator Elizabeth Warren, head of the anti-crypto army. “Everyone has to get out and vote; everyone has to continue to educate everyone they can.”Folino is no stranger to educating others, including policymakers in Pennsylvania, about Bitcoin and crypto. Through his work at the Pennsylvania Blockchain Coalition, he frequently speaks with state-level politicians.“Folks absolutely want to get it,” Folino told Bitcoin Magazine about the elected officials and bureaucrats who he educates in Pennsylvania.“We've got a lot of more open-minded members in the PA State House. And I think they're getting it in the Senate, as well,” he added, before sharing that crypto will be a pivotal issue in upcoming PA elections in both this election cycle and even more so in the future.A Sophisticated Voter BaseCalvert echoed Folino’s sentiment that crypto would continue to become a bigger voting issue as time goes on. She’s also been pleasantly surprised by not only how many have raised their voices to make crypto an issue in this election cycle, but by how sharp those who have spoken up and come out to the America Loves Crypto tour events are.“It's a really sophisticated crowd,” said Calvert of the tour’s attendees. “I expected more people who were just coming out for the artists, and what I've discovered is it's people who really, really care deeply about crypto.”Calvert also commented on the fact that those in attendance are not only educated when it comes to crypto but are active voters, as well.“In Detroit I asked the question ‘How many people know where their polling place is?’” said Calvert, before mimicking the majority of the crowd’s reaction by shooting her own hand into the air.“I was blown away. So, it's not just the sophistication of them as crypto owners, [but] their sophistication as voters. In Milwaukee, same thing. And here, same thing. I've been stunned by how sophisticated they are,” she added.In part because of what she’s seen on the tour, Calvert believes that the Bitcoin and crypto industry will find a home in the US.“America is going to win,” said Calvert.“You can't prevent innovation from happening. You can make it a lot harder. You can create barriers. But ultimately, I think innovation wins out,” she added, before noting that the new, powerful crypto voting block has to get out and vote in November to help expedite this process — especially in a state like Pennsylvania.The final date of the America Loves Crypto tour is scheduled for Wednesday, September 18, at The Black Cat in Washington, DC and will feature a performance by The Chainsmokers.

Bitcoin Magazine,REGULATING BITCOIN AND CRYPTO IN NIGERIA: CROSSROADS BETWEEN CAPITAL CONTROL AND FINANCIAL FREEDOM,"Tue, 17 Sep 2024 16:21:53 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/regulating-bitcoin-and-crypto-in-nigeria-crossroads-between-capital-control-and-financial-freedom,A call for sensible and measured Bitcoin regulation by the Nigerian government.,"The ascent of Bitcoin and digital assets has sparked a classic battle, with governments acting as vigilant hawks, trying to control a technology that is as nimble and elusive as a gazelle darting across the savanna of decentralization. In Nigeria, this conflict is as tangled as dense jungle foliage, where regulators strive to enforce their rules on a system meant to evade conventional constraints, while individuals continue to pursue the elusive prize of financial freedom just out of grasp. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has oscillated between hardline approaches and cautious acceptance, exemplified by its 2021 directive banning banks from facilitating Bitcoin transactions. Yet, just a few years later, the same CBN approved the launch of a Naira-backed stablecoin, signaling a growing recognition of the inevitable role digital currencies will play in the future of finance. However, these regulations, rather than protecting Nigerians, have often undermined the rights of citizens to freely participate in the financial revolution that Bitcoin offers. This culminated in a recent court case brought by James Otudor, an ardent Bitcoin advocate, who has sued the Nigerian government, seeking to establish the fundamental right of citizens to trade and own Bitcoin and USDt. The case shines a spotlight on the larger issue of human rights being trampled upon in the name of regulatory oversight. It’s not just about financial innovation, it's about ensuring that Nigerians are not excluded from the benefits of a global economy increasingly driven by decentralized technologies.

“The Chronology of Cryptocurrency Regulation In Nigeria” SOURCE :- Templars Law

Across Africa, the regulatory landscape for Bitcoin and digital assets is shaped by two competing paradigms: collaboration and confrontation. Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken some steps toward a collaborative model, as seen in the launch of its Regulatory Incubation Program aimed at fostering innovation while maintaining oversight. Yet, even within this supposedly progressive framework, the right of Nigerians to freely own and transact in Bitcoin remains under threat. Recent actions, such as the freezing of assets linked to the Bybit and KuCoin exchanges, illustrate how deeply entrenched government control remains. In other African nations, such as Ghana and Kenya, similar dynamics are playing out, with governments hesitating to fully embrace decentralized currencies, despite clear public demand. The Nigerian SEC's approval of two cryptocurrency exchanges in 2024 represents a positive step, but this piecemeal approach fails to address the larger issue of financial sovereignty for Nigerians. South Africa has taken a slightly more balanced route, regulating Bitcoin and digital assets as financial assets while allowing for greater integration into the traditional financial ecosystem. Nevertheless, these approaches, while varied, all point to the same fundamental issue: the lack of a clear framework that respects the unique nature of Bitcoin and its potential to transform economies and empower citizens.As Nigerian regulators grapple with how to manage this burgeoning industry, they must recognize that Bitcoin's regulatory landscape cannot be lumped together with the entire digital assets ecosystem. Bitcoin operates on fundamentally different principles, with decentralization at its core, unlike many other digital assets that may still rely on centralized control or governance. Any attempt to impose blanket regulations on all digital assets, including Bitcoin, would be a catastrophic misstep, one that risks stifling innovation and depriving Nigerians of the opportunity to fully participate in the global economy. Regulators must, therefore, approach Bitcoin with a unique understanding of its intrinsic operational metrics. Its decentralized nature is not a flaw to be regulated out of existence but a feature that offers unprecedented opportunities for financial inclusion and economic freedom. Policymakers should learn from global examples, such as Europe’s MiCA framework, but adapt those lessons to the specific context of Bitcoin, ensuring that they do not impose unnecessarily restrictive regulations. The failure to distinguish Bitcoin from other digital assets in the regulatory process would result in inefficiency, stifle innovation, and risk pushing legitimate activities into the shadows. James Otudor’s court case stands as a pivotal moment, not just for Nigeria but for the entire continent, as it seeks to ensure that financial regulations are crafted with a respect for human rights and an understanding of the transformative power of decentralized finance.

“The Global Crypto Adoption Index Score” SOURCE :- Chainalysis

The way forward for Nigeria is clear: regulators must craft policies that protect citizens while encouraging innovation, and they must do so with the understanding that Bitcoin is fundamentally different from other digital assets. The current regulatory push, if not carefully balanced, risks becoming a tool of oppression rather than empowerment. By engaging with the Bitcoin community and developing a nuanced approach to regulation, Nigeria can position itself as a leader in the global financial revolution. Anything less would be a disservice to the millions of Nigerians who have already embraced this new paradigm and a betrayal of the ideals of freedom and innovation that Bitcoin represents.This is a guest post by Heritage Falodun.

Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin’s Future in Payments: Overcoming Stablecoin Dominance with Fiatless Fiat  ,"Tue, 17 Sep 2024 13:37:36 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-future-in-payments-overcoming-stablecoin-dominance-with-fiatless-fiat,Bitcoin stable channels supported by the Lightning Network could introduce a novel peer-to-peer payment infrastructure to rival stablecoins,"Stablecoins have so far dominated the crypto payment market, but some Bitcoin developers believe there's a proposal out there that could offer a legitimate alternative. Seven years ago, Dorier, a long-time developer, set out to democratize bitcoin payment processing by launching a free and open-source alternative to the then-dominant BitPay: BTCPay Server. Today, despite the project's strong grassroots success among Bitcoin enthusiasts and online merchants, the landscape of cryptocurrency payments has evolved dramatically from when Dorier first began his journey. The rise of stablecoins has quickly dominated the space, pushing bitcoin—the world’s largest digital asset—to the sidelines in the payment processing arena.Fueled by growing demand for stable currency options, particularly US dollars, stablecoins have swiftly taken over the cryptocurrency payments market. This surge has left many Bitcoin enthusiasts struggling to cope with the reality that these dollar-pegged assets could reinforce the very system Bitcoin was designed to challenge—the hegemony of the US dollar. As stablecoins continue to gain traction, Bitcoin promoters find themselves at a crossroads, questioning how to preserve Bitcoin’s vision of financial sovereignty in a market increasingly leaning toward stability over decentralization.A new proposal emerging from the Lightning ecosystem has caught Dorier’s attention, and the veteran developer believes it could address this obstacle. Speaking to a packed audience at BTCPay Server’s recent annual community gathering in Riga, Dorier introduced the concept of ""fiatless fiat""—a Bitcoin-native alternative to treasury-backed stablecoins like Tether and USDC.Synthetic USD Back in 2015, BitMEX co-founder and then-CEO Arthur Hayes outlined in a blog post how to use futures contracts to create synthetic US dollars. Although this idea never gained widespread traction, it became a popular strategy among traders seeking to hedge against bitcoin's volatility without having to sell their underlying bitcoin positions.For readers less familiar with financial derivatives, a synthetic dollar (or synthetic position) can be created by two parties entering a contract to speculate on the price movement of an underlying asset—in this case, bitcoin. Essentially, by taking an opposite position to their bitcoin holdings in a futures contract, traders can protect themselves from price swings without having to sell their bitcoin or rely on a US dollar instrument. More recently, services like Blink Wallet have adopted this concept through the Stablesats protocol. Stablesats allows users to peg a portion of their bitcoin balance to a fiat currency, such as the US dollar, without converting it into traditional currency. In this model, the wallet operator acts as a ""dealer"" by hedging the user’s pegged balance using futures contracts on centralized exchanges. The operator then tracks the respective liabilities, ensuring that the user's pegged balance maintains its value relative to the chosen currency. (More detailed information about the mechanism can be found on the Stablesats website.)Obviously, this setup comes with a significant trade-off. By using Stablesats or similar services, users effectively relinquish custody of their funds to the wallet operator. The operator must then manage the hedging process and maintain the necessary contracts to preserve the synthetic peg.Stable channels and virtual balancesIn Riga, Dorier pointed out that a similar effect can be achieved between two parties using a different type of contract: Lightning channels. The idea follows recent work from Bitcoin developer Tony Klaus on a mechanism called stable channels. Instead of relying on centralized exchanges, stable channels connect users seeking to hedge their Bitcoin exposure with 'stability providers' over the Lightning network. A stable channel essentially functions as a shared Bitcoin balance, where funds are allocated according to the desired exposure of the 'stability receiver.' Leveraging Lightning’s rapid settlement capabilities, the balance can be continuously adjusted in response to price fluctuations, with sats shifting to either side of the channel as needed to maintain the agreed distribution.Here’s a simple chart to illustrate what the fund's breakdown may look like over time:

Clearly, this strategy entails considerable risks. As illustrated above, stability providers taking leveraged long positions on the exchange are exposed to large downside price volatility. Moreover, once the reserves of these stability providers are exhausted, users aiming to lock in their dollar-denominated value will no longer be able to absorb further price declines. While those types of rapid drawdowns are increasingly rare, Bitcoin’s volatility is always unpredictable and it’s conceivable that stability providers may look to hedge their risks in different ways. On the other hand, the structure of this construct allows participants' exposure within the channel to be linked to any asset. Provided both parties independently agree on a price, this can facilitate the creation of virtual balances on Lightning, enabling users to gain synthetic exposure to a variety of traditional portfolio instruments, such as stocks and commodities, assuming these assets maintain sufficient liquidity. Researcher Dan Robinson originally proposed an elaborated version of this idea under the name Rainbow Network. The good, the bad, the uglyThe concept of “fiatless fiat” and stable channels is compelling because of its simplicity. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that rely on complex and unsustainable economic models involving exogenous assets, the Bitcoin Dollar, as envisioned by Dorier and others, is purely the result of a voluntary, self-custodial agreement between two parties.This distinction is critical. Stablecoins usually involve a centralized governing body overseeing a global network, while a stable channel is a localized arrangement where risk is contained to the participants involved. Interestingly, it does not even have to rely on network effects: one user can choose to receive USD-equivalent payments from another, and subsequently shift the stability contract to a different provider at their discretion. Stability provision has the potential to become a staple service from various Lightning Service Provider types of entities competing and offering different rates.This focus on local interactions helps mitigate systemic risk and fosters an environment more conducive to innovation, echoing the original end-to-end principles of the internet.The protocol allows for a range of implementations and use cases, tailored to different user groups, while both stability providers and receivers maintain full control over their underlying bitcoin. No third party—not even an oracle—can confiscate a user’s funds. Although some existing stablecoins offer a degree of self-custody, they by contrast remain vulnerable to censorship, with operators able to blacklist addresses and effectively render associated funds worthless.Unfortunately, this approach also inherits several challenges and limitations inherent to self-custodial systems. Building on Lightning and payment channels introduces online requirements, which have been cited as barriers to the widespread adoption of these technologies. Because stable channels monitor price fluctuations through regular and frequent settlements, any party going offline can disrupt the maintenance of the peg, leading to potential instability. In an article further detailing his thoughts on the idea, Dorier entertains various potential solutions to a party going offline, mainly insisting that re-establishing the peg of funds already allocated to a channel “is a cheap operation.” Another potentially viable solution to the complex management of the peg involves the creation of ecash mints, which would issue stable notes to users and handle the channel relation with the stability provider. This approach already has real-world implementations and could see more rapid adoption due to its superior user experience. The obvious tradeoff is that custodial risks are reintroduced into a system designed to eliminate them. Still, proponents of ecash argue that its strong privacy and censorship-resistant properties make it a vastly superior alternative to popular stablecoins, which are prone to surveillance and control.Beyond this, the complexity of the Lightning protocol and the inherent security challenges posed by keeping funds at risk in ""hot"" channels will need careful consideration when scaling operations.Perhaps the most pressing challenge for this technology is the dynamic nature of the peg, which may attract noncooperative actors seeking to exploit short-term, erratic price movements. Referred to as the “free-option problem,” a malicious participant could cease honoring the peg, leaving their counterparties exposed to volatility and the burden of reestablishing a peg with another provider. In a post on the developer-focused Delving Bitcoin forum, stable channel developer Tony Klaus outlines several strategies to mitigate this issue, offering potential safeguards against these types of opportunistic behaviors.While no silver bullet exists, the emergence of a market for stability providers could potentially foster reputable counterparties whose long-term business interests will outweigh the short-term gains of defrauding users. As competition increases, these providers will have strong incentives to maintain trust and reliability, creating a more robust and dependable ecosystem for users seeking stability in their transactions.Concluding his presentation in Riga, Dorier acknowledged the novelty of this experiment but encouraged attendees to also consider its enticing potential. ""It's very far-fetched, it's a new idea. It's a new type of money. You need new business models. You need new protocols and new infrastructure. It's something more long-term, more forward-looking.""Users and developers interested to learn or contribute to the technology can find more information on the website or through the public Telegram channel."

Bitcoin Magazine,The Financial Anarchist Manifesto,"Mon, 16 Sep 2024 19:40:50 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/the-financial-anarchist-manifesto,"Using technologies like Nostr and Chaumian ecash, the Financial Anarchist challenges the status quo, aiming to reclaim economic sovereignty and disrupt centralized financial power through Bitcoin.","This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine's ""The Privacy Issue"". Subscribe to receive your copy.""Anarchy is order; government is civil war."" - BellegarrigueThe advent of decentralized money gave rise to an intriguing cognitive bias among early adopters. Bitcoin's success is convincing many that we can do away with trusted institutions altogether—that trust itself can be engineered away. This hubris is reflected in how we deploy our collective resources and capital. In the absence of appropriate social structures, we have become risk averse and generally mistrusting of each other. As a result, Bitcoin commerce has become marginalized and many revolutionaries have retreated into techno-utopianism. This complacency has deprived many of the tools needed to navigate this digital economy. Between regulated platforms and half-baked scaling solutions, there is little room for alternatives.The situation is bleak: the majority of Bitcoin’s commercial activity still revolves around fiat interfaces. Inertia has left users vulnerable to highly organized state actors. While our technical elite fantasizes about theoretical constructs, progress around practical solutions has stalled. Instead of stimulating market functions to replace current financial institutions, we have allowed them to further entrench their position, passively accepting their authority.This pattern is all too familiar in revolutionary movements—once wealth has been seized or obtained, ideals often become lazy.Fortunately, the convergence of two technologies—one old and one new—holds the potential to challenge the status quo. Chaumian ecash, decades in the making, and Nostr, a novel, decentralized, social network could provide the groundwork necessary for emergent behavior to trump central planning. The Financial Anarchist seeks to harness this potential and challenge the incumbent system with decentralized alternatives. He embraces the risk entailed by this duty because he believes it is right and just. He believes we can embrace and wield trust rather than reject it outrightFor the Financial Anarchist, decentralization is not an end in itself, but a means to empower individuals and cultivate genuine economic freedom.A public forumLike Bitcoin, Nostr does not attempt to prescribe what its users make of it; rather, it offers a set of rules for individuals to organize around and create a foundation for markets to emerge. Those rules are based on a fundamental set of principles: censorship resistance and decentralization.It achieves this using distributed servers called relays. Relays host content published by users, and thanks to encryption, cannot discriminate based on the nature of the content. Each user event is signed by his cryptographic key and Nostr ensures it remains always available by distributing data across multiple relays. Of course, users are also encouraged to run their own relays. To interact with this network of servers, participants use a variety of software clients that can verify the authenticity of messages shared by others.Those features and many more make Nostr a strong contender to become the identity layer for the online arena. Every individual is represented by a unique identifier tied to a public key. The motivation is to eliminate the concept of accounts usually associated with centralized platforms. The arrival of Nostr heralds a new era of market prosperity, enabling individuals to liberate themselves from the serfdom of the consumer internet. Identity is finally freed from its fiat chains.Thanks to its versatility, the protocol lends itself to an ever-growing number of use cases. Chief among them is the creation of social networks for us to coordinate around local and global marketplaces. An interesting trend in this direction is the integration of Nostr with Bitcoin payment applications. Using the protocol to communicate between Bitcoin services, we can enable interoperability so that our social graphs can be ported to any supported application. Our network becomes an extension of our Nostr public key, allowing us to maintain our financial relationships across platforms.The Financial Anarchist imagines Nostr as the foundation of a new Serene Republic, the ultimate theater for trade and industry in the digital world. It is here that we begin the process of individuation anew.Reputation marketsToday's reputation systems are entangled with fiat institutions, with public information about trade and commerce siloed into centralized databases. An open and distributed record of trust is a significant step towards a legal system more closely resembling natural laws. Based on cryptographic attestations of social connections, a functional Web-of-Trust can align users' incentives and allow markets to thrive by significantly reducing the costs typically associated with enforcing fiat contracts and laws. Though this may seem implausible, informal systems like Hawala already rely on trust and reputation to operate. Based on a global network of informal brokers, nearly half a trillion dollars move through these channels every year. Built on centuries of accumulated trust and relationships, Hawala examplifies the potential and resilience of self-regulating economies. (citation needed) Nostr introduces a radical shift in our approach to reputation as it promises to replace centralized certificate authorities with local and distributed trust archives. Relational databases can now be unique to every individual, informed by their voluntary interactions with other market participants. Using simple discovery features, we can reduce information asymmetry and practically eliminate barriers to entry. Individuals new to Nostr only need a single trusted connection to reveal an entire social graph based on their peer’s connections. Imagine the “recommended” feature of the average digital platform but open and extended to every facet of the market based on your social network.Nostr gives us the tools to survey the integrity of counterparties and accurately assess your position against them in the economy. It is now possible to establish trust structures outside the purview of traditional internet platforms.Economist Hernando De Soto has attested to the quality of societal records as a defining characteristic of modern societies. Keeping accurate records of assets and transactions is crucial to economic prosperity. Nostr allows us to take an unprecedented leap forward in this regard. We can finally seize information and our data back from the fiat overlords. The goal is not to eliminate institutions or middlemen but to democratize the provision of such services — preferring systems based on social accountability over centralized institutions and their monopoly on violence.Electronic cashWhile Bitcoin makes several tradeoffs to achieve global trust, the decentralization of finance should not be seen as an end in itself. Unfortunately, this misconception has gained popularity over the years, leading to inevitable conflicts of interest and moral hazards.A compelling alternative is to recognize and embrace the inherently local nature of finance. Finance operates locally, while money functions globally. Attempting to decentralize finance as if it were money is an exercise in futility.Chaumian ecash offers a different approach. For the uninitiated, ecash is a medium of payment made possible by the use of blinded servers. Using any form of collateral, the server can issue a corresponding number of tradeable notes. By design, Chaumian mints cannot identify individual payments, payers, or payees. Notes can be transmitted over any communication layer and do not rely on third parties for settlement. The Lightning network allows every Chaumian mint to settle with one another, allowing local finance to operate at a global scale. Despite its remarkable features, ecash has often been dismissed by casual observers due to its custodial model. However, this perspective overlooks its true potential. By distributing risk across smaller, local instances, we can address the systemic issues typically associated with custodians. Payments are inherently social, making intermediated finance a natural fit for many transactions. The Financial Anarchist dreams of a future where every Bitcoin wallet has access to the modern equivalent of a neighborhood bank. By leveraging their Nostr social graph, users will be able to quickly identify trusted payment hubs within their network. In doing so, ecash protocols will redefine banking and payment services. We can reduce finance to its smallest common denominators, reversing decades of centralization caused by fiat cronyism.Using Nostr as a coordination mechanism, we can empower communities to pool common resources and establish dedicated financial hubs. Individuals can interface with the Lightning network by sharing channels and liquidity, providing cost-effective payments for every participant. Any group of users can now collaborate to optimize their interactions with the Bitcoin network. As a result, the convenience and user experience associated with custodial wallets are no longer exclusive to large institutions.Because of the protocol’s versatility, onboarding other users becomes trivial. Ecash notes can be issued for every payment request and used by the recipient to pay any Lightning invoice. Atomic payments allow it to piggyback off any wallet on the network without the application developer changing a single line of code. Users can accumulate notes from different issuers or swap them into their preferred mint. Alternatively, distinct notes can be used to fund a single multi-party payment, affording users incredible freedom and optionality. Members of certain communities may begin accepting a collection of different notes depending on their relative social proximity to the issuers. Mints could be distributed such that multiple operators could issue tokens, effectively distributing the risk of user exposure to a single operator. This free flow of payment will snowball in different ways. First, a new class of dedicated users will emerge, advertising their services through various marketplaces. One area of particular interest is the provision of stable ecash notes. Thanks to its native programmability, it’s possible to issue dollar-denominated ecash backed by Bitcoin reserves. This could have significant implications for the Bitcoin economy. Using the asset as collateral presents many opportunities to extend its market demand beyond its current speculative use cases. This could result in a flywheel effect which provides the necessary liquidity for it to stabilize over time and become a more reliable medium of exchange. Until then, the unique properties of ecash make it a superior option for payment applications which could see it challenging the current treasury-backed stablecoin hegemony. The operation of stablecoin mints also creates compelling incentives for liquidity providers. By issuing dollar-denominated notes, they can establish non-custodial long exposure to Bitcoin and take directional bets on the asset. The distributed and permissionless nature of ecash operations presents an interesting contrast to the centralization of current stablecoin issuers, offering market actors a way to hedge their risks against single points of failure.The grassroots adoption of this technology will undoubtedly face challenges, akin to the early days of Bitcoin and Lightning. While hobbyists and amateurs play a crucial role in bootstrapping ecash, creating a robust and reliable financial system at scale will involve growing pains. Opportunists may exploit others' trust, and the custodial aspect of mints makes them particularly susceptible to scams and fraud.However, safeguards can be implemented to mitigate these risks. One idea being explored is programmatic redemption, which would require issuers to regularly prove their solvency. Users would periodically “rotate” the notes in their wallets, exchanging them for new ones. Some have referred to the idea as “scheduled bank runs”. The technical details could be abstracted away to ensure a seamless experience. Additionally, various “Proof-of-Liability” systems are being developed to mitigate the risks of fractional reserves.As a general rule, it is wise to avoid holding more in ecash mints than one can afford to lose.ConclusionWe have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear. - A Declaration of the Independence of CyberspaceIn an age where centralized authorities dictate the rules of financial engagement, the Financial Anarchist emerges with a radical proposition: to support an alternative system reliant on trust between individuals.This is not a call for civil disobedience. It is also not an attempt to undermine the valiant work of developers focusing on trust-minimized technologies. It is the proclamation of the undeniable potential within our grasp as individuals to organize and use technology to elevate our communities. The spirit of voluntary association at the heart of Bitcoin should drive us to focus our efforts on maximizing market optionality. Sadly, the paternalistic approach borne out of techno-utopianism has failed at this mission and left us stuck within the constraints of traditional financial institutions.The Financial Anarchist envisions a world where Nostr and Chaumian ecash allow us to reclaim this sovereignty. By opening up the design space for experimentation and locally-driven initiatives, we are making a conscious effort to divorce from the centralized command structure we’ve inherited. The vision of autonomy and self-regulation alluded to by those tools reinforces the notion that individuals should be free to define their economic relationships on their own terms.We must build new autonomous zones across cyberspace, away and out of reach from the “weary giants of flesh and steel” Perry Barlow warned us about. The current state of distrust in our ranks is not the natural order of things; it is the consequence of generations of imposed authority. It is no surprise that today nobody even trusts their neighbor. Should Bitcoin prevail, we expect this trend to reverse course and eventually foster levels of trust among individuals previously deemed unimaginable. Anything less would be a tragic outcome."

With 840,000 Wisconsinites owning some form of cryptocurrency, the narrow 2020 electoral margin of just 20,000 votes could easily be disrupted by the undecided crypto vote in 2024.The America Loves Crypto crowd was met with politicians from both sides of the aisle as well as Bitcoin and crypto industry representatives, followed by up-and-coming artist Jessie Murph, whose soulful blend of country and pop music resonated with a surprising number of fans.The event's speakers included Josh Schoemann, Washington County Executive (R); Peter Burgelis, City of Milwaukee Alderman (D); Kara Calvert, Coinbase Head of U.S. Policy; Dom Bei, founder of Proof of Workforce; Spencer Smith, Founder of AmpliPhi Digital; Tiara Nicole, Co-founder of Craft the Future; Ian McCullough, Stand With Crypto WI chapter president and Awen co-founder; and Maggie Schmidt, Awen co-founder.Wisconsin State Pension’s Bitcoin InvestmentIn May of this year, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) invested $162 million dollars in Bitcoin ETFs, becoming the first U.S. state pension fund to invest in the asset class.“The Wisconsin retirement system is a very healthy fund, and it’s funded at almost 100%. Very few pensions in the U.S. can boast that, and they are the 10th largest pension in the nation,” Dom Bei told Bitcoin Magazine.“They have a good balance of being both conservative and innovative. It’s a huge deal because they are healthy and they are looked at nationwide as a leader in the space,” he added.Bei is a firefighter for the city of Santa Monica, California and Founder of the Bitcoin 501(c)(4) non-profit Proof of Workforce Foundation who educates workers, unions, pensions and municipalities with education-based Bitcoin adoption. To Bei, the trend of pensions investing in Bitcoin will only continue to gain momentum.“The $5 billion dollar Houston Firefighters Relief and Pension Fund was actually the first public pension fund to buy Bitcoin back in 2021,” Bei explained. “The state of Michigan has also made a small $7 million allocation to Bitcoin ETFs. It will be fascinating to see the profile of the pensions that follow, whether they are underwater and mismanaged, or fully funded and operating from a place of strength,” he added.For Bei, Bitcoin is not just a tool for risk managers and Wall Street-types seeking outperformance, but an opportunity to re-engineer the American city for the benefit of wage earners, not just those in power.“It’s not just necessarily about municipalities holding bitcoin”, said Bei. “It’s really about activating the Bitcoin community, its innovation, and competing to bring in Bitcoin companies while increasing financial literacy for everyone.”“If union members and workers learn the history of Bitcoin and why it was created, they are going to understand immediately where Bitcoin fits into the union story and the genesis of organized labor,” said Bei. “Bitcoin was created as a response to the financial system placing its failures on the backs of the wage earner.”Bei’s non-profit has partnered with the City of Santa Monica to launch the Santa Monica Bitcoin Office, akin to the El Salvador Bitcoin Office, to launch a Peer to Pier Bitcoin Festival in October of this year during Los Angeles Tech Week.When it comes to other investment allocators taking the plunge with Bitcoin and crypto, Spencer Smith, founder of marketing firm AmpliPhi Digital and Board Member of the Wisconsin Technology Council, sees Wisconsin’s allocation as an extremely important signal to the investment community.“If I’m an investment manager reporting to a committee, you can point to the state of Wisconsin and say ‘Well, they did it, here’s how they did it, and why I propose that we [allocate to Bitcoin].’ said Smith. “Having that first-mover advantage is important for Wisconsin, [and] it really sets the stage for the rest of the states as well.”Smith also noted that Bitcoin’s sideways price action, following the meteoric 2021 bull run, has led to more clear conversations amongst Wisconsin legislators as well.“Now that the hype has died down, it gives us a lot more room to educate on a basis that’s more from an understanding [of] ‘How do we figure this out? Now that there’s ETFs, how do we deploy these? How do you explain compliance?’” he said.Incentives first. Party second.Wisconsin has seen a stark divide between its rural and urban voter populations, reflecting a larger national trend of partisan polarization with rural voters predominantly voting Republican and urban voters predominantly voting Democrat. Despite that backdrop, the Red Rock Saloon saw a unique blend of poly-partisanship on display, where Republicans, Democrats and even Independents saw value in courting the crypto voter.Delivering remarks in the typically deep blue Milwaukee, Joe Schoemann (R), Executive of the rural Washington county, received loud cheers in response to his re-affirmation of crypto as a means of prosperity for the average American.“I’ve been focused on giving the American Dream to the American citizen,” said Schoemann to the crowd. “Crypto represents that for all of us.”It’s no secret that the Bitcoin and crypto industry has seen what many view as unwarranted, or at least unwelcome, attacks from the national regulatory apparatus in the last few years, and because of this, the industry is not backing down.This attitude was echoed by Peter Burgelis (D), City of Milwaukee Alderman.“I ran for office because the election didn’t go my way and I was pissed,” said Alderman to the crowd “And when something doesn’t go your way, you can post something dumb on social media or you can put your boots on and run. And I ran and I won,” he added. “Crypto is important and your vote matters. Get out and vote.”U.S. Senate candidate Phil Anderson (I) reflected on the fact that Bitcoin and crypto appear to be one of the few issues that can transcend party lines.  “We don’t have representative government anymore,” Anderson told Bitcoin Magazine.“Lobbyists write the bills and the two-party system makes the representatives vote a certain way. And that goes to what all of Congress will agree to: constantly spending on war, constantly spending without any responsibility and really abusing fiat money,” he added.“It’s all tied together, and it’s important to support Bitcoin and blockchain as a way of making our government more transparent and more accountable.”With his campaign slogan of #DisruptTheCorruption, Anderson sees Bitcoin and crypto as both a technological and electoral priority for representative democracy.The next America Loves Crypto event is in Philadelphia, PA on September 16, followed by a 600-person event in Washington, D.C., culminating in a featured performance by The Chainsmokers to close out the tour.Attendees may RSVP for the free events via the Stand With Crypto website."

Bhutan’s Bitcoin mining activities are conducted by the Kingdom’s investment arm, Druk Holdings. According to Arkham, the country has constructed mining facilities at multiple sites, with the largest on the grounds of the defunct Education City project. Arkham further noted, ""We were able to corroborate the timeline of on-chain mining activity with time-lapse satellite imagery of facility construction.""In May of 2023, Bitdeer partnered with Druk Holding & Investments to develop the 100% carbon-free Bitcoin mining operation in Bhutan.Earlier this year, a Bloomberg report revealed that Druk Holding & Investments and Bitdeer were expanding their mining capacity from 100 to 600 megawatts. Bhutan’s focus on eco-friendly mining is bolstered by its abundant hydropower resources, making it an ideal location for eco-friendly mining."
Bitcoin Magazine,The Urgent Need for Bitcoin Tax Reform to Encourage Everyday Use,"Mon, 16 Sep 2024 16:21:17 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/the-urgent-need-for-bitcoin-tax-reform-to-encourage-everyday-use,An argument for why tax treatment of bitcoin is a massive disincentive for its use in commerce. ,"The debt based monetary system has become quite extreme. On one hand, the US crossed the $35 trillion national debt milestone, placing a $104k burden on every US citizen. On the other hand, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) puts federal expenditures for 2024 at 24.2% of GDP.This divergence between profligate spending and debt ballooning puts the economy on a narrow path. It is exceedingly unlikely that USG would opt to reduce spending, most of which goes to social programs, entitlements and the military. The latter alone is the key ingredient that backs USD as world currency.Conversely, this entails another Fed balance sheet expansion, with three 0.25% rate cuts this year already priced in. In turn, non-currency assets like equities, gold and Bitcoin are poised for growth yet again. At the root of this dynamic is the question of information validity.Just as the US Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to revise down job figures by up to one million between April 2023 and March 2024, the information corruption is visible with central banking itself. If the Federal Reserve can increase M2 money supply by 27% in 2020-21, the money itself loses informational coherence.It is this why investors then seek equities, gold and Bitcoin. These assets become vehicles of value because currency loses its ability to reliably relay value. The problem is, they are also taxed as a way to subdue the velocity of exiting the central banking system.This is especially pertinent for Bitcoin, a unique asset that is both a store of value but could be made as a daily transaction driver. The question then poses itself, is a legalistic landscape viable in which low-value Bitcoin transactions are exempt from federal taxation?Bitcoin’s Usage and Currency Substitution SuitabilityTo understand the regulatory path forward, we first need to understand how Bitcoin is typically used. After all, contrasting Bitcoin usage against fiat usage paints a clearer picture if Bitcoin can be used as a practical currency, or if it will be perceived as a threat to the current monetary system.Notwithstanding layer 2 scaling solutions such as Lightning Network, the more BTC is used the greater is the load on the Bitcoin mainnet as miners process transaction blocks. In turn, greater network activity generates greater friction, manifesting as escalating fees for each BTC transaction. In a developed country like Australia, cryptocurrency usage for payments has been typically minimal. 


Image credit: Reserve Bank of AustraliaThis is predictable as people need strong incentives to move away from existing payment solutions, ones that are already instantaneous and convenient.At best, BTC transactions mostly revolve around third-parties facilitating BTC transactions using fiat currency. Case in point, Bitcoin onramp platform Strike had to ditch Prime Trust custodian as it eventually filed for bankruptcy. However, Strike still uses banks such as Lead, Cross River Bank, and Customers Bank.In other words, Bitcoin adoption is attached to online payment systems, through commercial banks which are tied to central banks. The latter have already made money de facto digital, except it is hosted on their ledgers.Although these institutions can tamper with the money supply, they can do so to facilitate maximum liquidity needed for a debt-based monetary system in which fiat currency is effectively a debt-tracker.In contrast, Bitcoin’s scarcity makes it less appealing for such use. Gold already showcased this when it was abandoned. Because gold’s supply was not flexible enough to support a growing (debt-based) economy, mainstream economists viewed the gold-backed currency as outdated. Moreover, Bitcoin is ill-suited as a daily currency driver against feeless alternatives like Nano (XNO) that boast eco-friendly green hosting or potential CBDCs. Rather, Bitcoin’s strength relies on inviolable scarcity, one that serves as a global reserve settlement layer. While both of these factors, network friction and flexible liquidity, are making Bitcoin less suitable as a proper medium of exchange, it also makes Bitcoin less threatening to the system. But does that mean that Bitcoin’s tax treatment should be tweaked?The Impact of Current Tax Policies on Bitcoin UsageOn exchanges and platforms like aforementioned Strike, users can freely buy Bitcoin without worrying it will be a taxable event. It only becomes so when BTC is sold for profit. Then, it is subject to capital gains tax for trading. That’s because the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) designates Bitcoin as property. If Bitcoin is held less than a year before it is sold, holders are subject to ordinary income tax rate ranging from 10% to 37%.Holding Bitcoin over one year makes it subject to 0% - 20% tax rate, depending on the income level spread across three brackets - 0%, 15% and 20%. In turn, Bitcoin holders have to keep a track of when they bought BTC, at which price, and when they sold it, at which price. The profit difference is taxed as capital gains.Likewise, swapping Bitcoin for another cryptocurrency is a taxable event, subject to capital gains tax. If BTC is received as payment/earnings, or from mining/staking/airdrops, it is then treated as wages income tax, falling into the 10% - 37% ordinary income tax range. Alongside buying BTC, holding it or donating it to a registered non-profit, users can also transfer bitcoins from exchanges to wallets without constituting taxable events. Although BTC gifts can also pass as non-taxable upon reception, they would still be subject to the same tax regime later.In the case of selling Bitcoin at a loss, holders could write it off, limited to $3,000 per year (carriable into next year if exceeded). At the moment, it is still possible to engage in Bitcoin tax-loss harvesting, in which holders can sell BTC at a loss to claim the tax break, and then buy it back. Unfortunately, this leeway not enjoyed by shareholders could be terminated with the proposed Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act, under Section 1091, “Loss from wash sales of specified assets”.But even with that tax break still open, it is clear that Bitcoin’s unique nature is not reflected in IRS treatment. The tracking alone of every BTC transaction severely discourages daily use as the mere purchase of a pint of beer would require calculating initial BTC price to see whether it was at a loss or at a gain.Likewise, merchants would have to hassle with the same tax regime because they technically received property, not money. Combined with the previously mentioned issues of friction and flexible liquidity, this puts an additional burden on mass Bitcoin adoption by incentivizing long-term holding.Moreover, Bitcoin’s expansion into innovative financial products is impeded as well.The Tax Burden on Bitcoin DerivativesAlthough Bitcoin has become the least volatile cryptocurrency due to its large $1.2 trillion market cap, holders would still prefer to protect themselves against price fluctuations. Derivatives, such as options and futures, make this possible.Additionally, Bitcoin’s price volatility creates opportunities for traders willing to bet if BTC price will go up (going long) or down (going short). This speculative market important for risk hedging and price discovery is also burdened by the current tax regime.Once an options contract is exercised, or when it expires, it is subject to capital gains tax. Most traders will create trading alerts to signal the moment BTC price crosses a certain threshold. This helps traders to respond quickly as the loss or capital gain tax is calculated based on the difference between Bitcoin’s fair market value and the strike price. So, staying consistently updated on Bitcoin’s fair market value is a challenge.Additional difficulty would be to calculate the fair market of another cryptocurrency if it was the vehicle for Bitcoin contract settlement.But if the contract expires without buying BTC, the capital loss would be regarded as the paid premium for the contract. On the other end of the equation, sellers of Bitcoin options premiums would have to pay capital gains tax as well. When it comes to futures contracts, 60% of gains/losses are taxed as long-term capital gains/losses, while 40% are taxed as short term capital gains/losses. This is irrespective of futures contract length.While derivatives markets greatly enhance liquidity and trading volume, the current Bitcoin tax regime discourages broader participation.The Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act and BitcoinThe year 2024 turned into a massive pileup of good news for Bitcoin, barely bothered by the German government’s BTC selloffs. The most recognizable cryptocurrency received an institutional blessing when the Securities and Commissions Exchange (SEC) approved 11 exchange-traded funds (ETFs), having climbed to $48.13 billion AuM as of August 20th.Not only did Bitcoin ETFs exceed all expectations, but their success served as an endorsement ramp for two presidential candidates, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former President Donald Trump. Both endorsed the idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve at the Nashville Bitcoin 2024 conference at the end of July.Just at that time, senators Ted Budd (R-NC), Krysten Sinema (I-AZ), Cynthia Lummis ( R-WY) and Kirsten Gilibrand (D-NY) re-introduced bill S.4808, the Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act.As the bill’s title implies, cryptocurrencies would receive the same tax treatment that is currently reserved for foreign currencies. Meaning, under the value of $200, cryptocurrency transactions would only be subject to regular sales tax. Although this is still behind El Salvador’s approach of having Bitcoin as legal tender, the bill would immediately lift the barrier for small item purchases in merchant locations.Previously, one of the co-sponsors, Sen. Cynthia Lummis, noted she is “absolutely certain that Bitcoin will be among them…and perhaps dominant among them”, referring to a future world order based on a basket of global reserve currencies.As of the latest campaign development, presidential candidate Kamala Harris is in favor of President Biden’s 44.6% capital gains tax, in addition to raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. The Broader Implications for Bitcoin AdoptionAlthough to a lesser extent, recession is still on the table moving into 2025. If materialized, this will be another BTC price test, if its risk-off status will be light or heavy. But on the long-term horizon, the structure of mass democracy doesn’t allow for austerity.And if austerity is not on the horizon, the ballooning of the Fed’s balance sheet is, inevitably eroding USD confidence. It is anyone’s guess if factions vying for power will allow Bitcoin to become a potential exit vehicle on that road.Making BTC transactions under $200 subject to sales tax, instead of capital gains tax, would go a long way in further ingraining Bitcoin into the financial system. Considering that Blackrock’s IBIT has become the largest Bitcoin ETF, at $17.24B AuM, it is fair to say that Bitcoin’s “threat” perception has been muted, if not abandoned.ConclusionCurrently priced at above $60k per BTC, it is becoming increasingly clear that only a tiny micro minority will ever own more than 1 BTC. Accordingly, such a small population pool is unlikely to shake the proverbial central banking boat.What is more likely to form is a parallel, hybrid system in which Bitcoin is both a commodity and a premium currency that is tracked. This is evidenced by the fact that even senators not explicitly anti-crypto want expansive cryptocurrency surveillance.And Bitcoin’s transparent ledger is ideally suited for it. This is a positive development as privacy-oriented cryptocurrencies like Monero (XMR) have already been ousted from the largest exchange onramps. Without those headwinds when sailing on a fiat ocean, Bitcoin is free to foster greater financial inclusivity and innovation despite the onramp/offramp barriers, including taxing an appreciating asset. The Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act is paving the road, but it is likely to receive more tweaks. Specifically, it is yet not clear how transactions amounting to $200 are aggregated. This is a guest post by Shane Neagle.

Bitcoin Magazine,Mi Primer Bitcoin Promotes Two Staff Members to Leadership Roles,"Mon, 16 Sep 2024 14:00:08 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/mi-primer-bitcoin-promotes-two-staff-members-to-leadership-roles,The open-source Bitcoin education platform founded in El Salvador moves two members of its in-house talent — one a native Salvadoran — into supervisory positions.,"In the wake of Mi Primer Bitcoin’s three-year anniversary, the El Salvador-based organization announced that it has promoted two of its staff members — Reyna Chicas and Quentin Ehrenmann — to leadership positions.Chicas, a native Salvadoran who has been with the organization for approximately two years, has quickly ascended through its ranks from teacher to Lead Teacher to a member of the Board of Directors to now the Director of Education. She has shined since the beginning of her time with Mi Primer Bitcoin (MPB), when the organization sent her to Bitcoin Lake in Guatemala for six months to teach in the community. During this past year, she’s been a point person for Mi Primer Bitcoin for its communications with El Salvador’s Ministry of Education.

“As a Salvadoran who began this journey as a teacher, I’ve experienced firsthand the power of education to inspire growth and change,” said Chicas in MPB’s announcement.“With this new opportunity as Director of Education, my commitment is stronger than ever to help create more stories of empowerment with MPB, to be a good example for my people, both in my country and beyond, and to show that with passion, effort, and dedication, we can build a better future,” she added.Ehrenmann has also been a rising star since joining MPB in 2023 and was recently promoted to General Manager of the organization. For his first project for MPB, he moved to an underdeveloped island off the eastern coast of El Salvador and kickstarted an education-focused circular economy. After that, he moved to the mountains of Berlin, El Salvador to educate within the community there. He was then promoted to Director of Operations, where he helped further MPB’s Node Network of Independent Educators, which now includes teachers in 27 countries.“From working on a special project on an island off El Salvador to joining the leadership team and contributing to the execution of our mission, my journey at Mi Primer Bitcoin has been incredibly rewarding,” said Quentin in MPB’s announcement. “I look forward to helping bring independent Bitcoin education to the next 100,000 students.”For more on Mi Primer Bitcoin, read our Founders profile on the organization’s founder, John Dennehy."
Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Mining Shutdown Cause 20% Surge in Electricity Bills,"Mon, 16 Sep 2024 13:26:09 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-shutdown-cause-20-surge-in-electricity-bills,The shutdown of a Bitcoin mining facility in Norway caused a 20% increase in electricity bills for the town's residents. The loss of the mining operation's revenue forced the local power company to raise rates to offset costs.,"The closure of a Bitcoin mining facility in the Norwegian town of Hadsel has led to a 20% increase in electricity bills for residents. The mine was shut down after the municipality declined to renew its permit due to noise complaints.Kryptovault operated the mining facility for 20% of local power company Noranett's revenue. With the loss of its largest customer, Noranett is raising prices for households to compensate.Locals had complained for years about noise from the mine's cooling fans. However, due to the closure, residents are now faced with paying several hundred dollars more per year for electricity.""When such a large individual customer switches off overnight, it has an impact,"" said a Noranett manager. The company estimates bills could rise by up to $300 monthly.While unhappy about the price hikes, Hadsel's mayor said the municipality must deal with the consequences of losing a major power consumer under the regulations. He said the town will now seek new projects to utilize the excess energy capacity.The situation highlights how Bitcoin mining can help reduce electricity costs by distributing grid expenses to a larger customer base. Bitcoin mine's continued operation would have prevented the rate spike for citizens.The incident has fueled debate in Norway about imposing restrictions on energy-intensive mining. This could force miners to relocate operations abroad and can further lead to an increase in prices for residents. "
Bitcoin Magazine,Detroit Aims to Drive Digital Asset Innovation on Day Three of the America Loves Crypto Tour,"Fri, 13 Sep 2024 20:20:40 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/detroit-aims-to-drive-digital-asset-innovation-on-day-three-of-the-america-loves-crypto-tour,"The Motor City and State of Michigan see opportunity in creating a business-friendly environment for the Bitcoin and crypto industry, welcoming the Stand With Crypto Alliance.","Crypto-natives and fans of Detroit rapper Big Sean flocked to the Lager House, just outside of downtown Detroit, for the third stop of the America Loves Crypto Tour. The event provided both an evening of live entertainment and a call to action to get out the crypto vote in the upcoming 2024 elections following previous stops in Arizona and Nevada.Michigan is considered a battleground state, and the Stand With Crypto Alliance sees the state’s 940,000 bi-partisan Bitcoin and crypto owners — 25,000 of which are Stand With Crypto members — as potentially crucial for the upcoming presidential election. The 2020 election’s margin within Michigan was only about 156,000 voters, which means that crypto voters could well swing the electoral outcomes in 2024.Local startup founders, university blockchain clubs, former State Representative Ryan Berman (R) and operatives of the Stand With Crypto Alliance took the stage for the third stop on the battleground state roadshow to communicate a simple message: Digital asset owners and entrepreneurs have leverage, and it’s time to make their political voices heard.The last few years have seen the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) inconsistent regulatory actions have a chilling effect on the industry. Adam Zientarski, co-founder of Detroit Ledger Technologies, remarked that he would like to see that change so that “startups can actually be focused on growth and not on moving the company to another country”. On behalf of entrepreneurs in the state, he simply asks regulators to “let them build.”In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, former Michigan State representative and Attorney General candidate Ryan Berman echoed similar thoughts on the role of regulation.“You can’t predict what is going to happen in this technology space, but we want to make sure people can innovate and have the tools necessary without government blocking them,” Berrman said. “Detroit has been on a rebound over the last couple of decades. It would be beneficial and put Michigan on the map to say ‘Hey, we want to welcome these types of companies, we want innovation.’”Berrman went on to emphasize the economic importance of fostering innovation in the state:“Here, at this event, we’ve heard from these entrepreneurs from the University of Michigan, [which] has half of their student body from out of state. The other half is in-state kids from our big schools – currently, our students leave the state looking for jobs. What can we do to keep our students here? Technology is at the forefront.Crypto Education: Not Just For Elected OfficialsTechnological innovation took the driver’s seat during the America Loves Crypto’s stop in The Motor City, and what stuck out was the cultural interest in Bitcoin and crypto co-mingled with the pride many Detroiters, in particular college students, have for their state of residence. President of the University of Michigan Blockchain Club Evan Solomon received raucous applause from the crowd when shouting out his alma mater.College students and educational institutions, a particular point of pride for Michigan, seem to be paying strong attention to Bitcoin and crypto during this election season. Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Solomon proudly shared that his on-campus club has received support from the prestigious Ross School of Business to host an event with 25 visiting organizations in attendance.Yet, Solomon also remarked that clear regulation is “the single most important thing” when it comes to fostering talent and strengthening the industry in the state. When students consider what careers or companies to pursue post-college, the stigma of over-regulation is a major factor. But the tides are turning and Solmon is optimistic following a 2023 meeting with U.S. Senator Gary Peters (D), saying: “I thought the reception was great, they wanted to hear us out, and they wanted to hear about the applications.”Code And Law: Constitutional Battles for DevelopersBitcoin and crypto are in the State of Michigan not just a matter of revenue and economic development, but of important constitutional considerations for more than 940,000 Michigan crypto owners.Berman, who has a background in law, explained that overlapping First, Second and Fourth Amendment considerations have informed his perspective on crypto. Specifically, he argued that 3D printing files for creating firearms are as much a Second Amendment constitutional right as they are issues of free speech and privacy, and he sees overlap with cryptocurrency in that regard now that developers of open source privacy tools are also being prosecuted.“Freedom of speech is what our Founding Fathers were all about. Publishing a manual can be bad if somebody uses it for a bad purpose, but [in the case of 3D-printed guns] there’s plenty of legitimate purposes as well. But even if there aren’t any, it doesn’t matter what the purpose is, it’s all about freedom, it’s all about the First Amendment. I’m totally an advocate for not only the Second and First Amendments, but the Fourth Amendment in particular when you’re talking about encrypted communications.”America Loves Crypto continues its road show this week and the following in Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Washington D.C. Attendees can RSVP for these free events where they will be able to register to vote while connecting with like-minded folks ahead of election day this November."

Earlier this summer, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted that a rate cut could come as early as September. Speaking on June 12th, Powell noted that the central bank would consider lowering rates once they were confident inflation was moving back toward their 2% target.

The Golden Ratio Multiplier (lower orange line) indicates that the 350-day moving average, currently around $53,000, has been a solid level of support during this market cycle, especially as this is close to the technical $52,000 support and significant psychological support of $50,000.

Figure 2: Nearby support between $53,000 and $50,000, with immediate resistance between $60,000 and $62,000.

More Chop?In the short term, Bitcoin could very well continue ranging between the low $50,000 region and the $60,000 resistance, similar to the range we had formed between $70,000 and $60,000 that led to fairly stagnant price action for a majority of 2024. Despite recent downturns, Bitcoin's long-term outlook is still promising. In the past, Bitcoin has experienced similar periods of fluctuating prices before eventually reaching new highs. However, this process can take some time, potentially weeks or even months, before a sustainable trend reversal occurs following periods of low volatility.

","According to Geoff Kendrick, Head of Crypto Research at Standard Chartered bank, a Donald Trump victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election could drive Bitcoin to $125,000. However, Kendrick notes that new all-time highs (ATHs) for Bitcoin are likely no matter who wins the election, with Bitcoin still expected to hit $75,000 if Vice President Kamala Harris secures the presidency.JUST IN: A Trump victory could send #Bitcoin to $125,000, but new ATHs are likely no matter who wins election, says Standard Chartered bank 🚀 pic.twitter.com/SfGoRSyKwn— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 12, 2024

In the new report, Kendrick explained that while the outcome of the election will impact the Bitcoin industry, the risks of a Harris presidency may be overstated. “BTC will end 2024 at fresh all-time highs under either election outcome – [circa] $125,000 level under Trump or c.$75,000 level under Harris,” Kendrick wrote. While a Harris win could initially result in a price decline, he emphasized that ""dips would be bought as the market recognizes that progress on the regulatory front will still be forthcoming.""Despite concerns within the industry that Harris may adopt a more hostile stance toward Bitcoin, Kendrick believes that her administration would be ""much less negative"" for digital assets than a second Biden administration. Furthermore, Standard Chartered maintains its bullish outlook, forecasting that Bitcoin will hit $200,000 by the end of 2025, regardless of who wins this year’s election.The 2024 election has drawn attention to the differing approaches to Bitcoin regulation by the two candidates. Trump has become an ally to the Bitcoin industry, speaking at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville this summer, where he expressed support for Bitcoin. The Republican National Committee has also included Bitcoin in its platform, pledging to defend the right to mine Bitcoin and protect self-custody.In contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris has remained silent on the issue, opting not to attend the Bitcoin conference. The Democratic Party’s platform makes no mention of Bitcoin or cryptocurrency, which has led to concerns within the industry about the potential regulatory environment under a Harris administration. Although Harris has not publicly shown hostility to crypto, some fear a continuation of the stricter regulatory policies seen during President Joe Biden’s term, notably shaped by figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren and SEC Chair Gary Gensler."
Bitcoin Magazine,Revolutionizing Bitcoin Mining: The Power of Three-Phase Systems,"Thu, 12 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/revolutionizing-bitcoin-mining-the-power-of-three-phase-systems,Why Three-Phase electrical systems can offer a competitive advantage to miners with ASIC efficiency gains tapering off.,"Bitcoin mining has seen exponential growth since the first ASIC miner was shipped in 2013, improving hardware efficiency from 1,200 J/TH to just 15 J/TH. While these advancements were driven by better chip technology, we're now reaching the limits of silicon-based semiconductors. As further efficiency gains plateau, the focus must shift to optimizing other aspects of mining operations—particularly the power setup.Three-phase power has emerged as a superior alternative to single-phase power in bitcoin mining. With more ASICs being designed for three-phase voltage input, future mining infrastructure should consider adopting a uniform 480v three-phase system, especially given its abundance and scalability across North America.Understanding Single-Phase and Three-Phase PowerTo comprehend the significance of three-phase power in bitcoin mining, it's essential first to understand the basics of single-phase and three-phase power systems.Single-phase power is the most common type of power supply used in residential settings. It consists of two wires: one live wire and one neutral wire. The voltage in a single-phase system oscillates sinusoidally, providing power that reaches a peak and then drops to zero twice during each cycle. Imagine you are pushing a person on a swing. With each push, the swing moves forward and then comes back, reaching a peak height and then descending back to the lowest point before you push again. Just like the swing, a single-phase power system has periods of maximum and zero power delivery. This can lead to inefficiencies, especially when consistent power is required, although this inefficiency is negligible in residential applications. However, it becomes significant in high-demand, industrial-scale operations like bitcoin mining.Three-phase power, on the other hand, is commonly used in industrial and commercial settings. It consists of three live wires, providing a more constant and reliable power flow. In the same swing analogy, imagine you have three people pushing the swing, but each person is pushing at different intervals. One person pushes the swing just as it starts to slow down from the first push, another pushes it a third of the way through the cycle, and the third person pushes it two-thirds of the way through. The result is a swing that moves much more smoothly and consistently because it’s being pushed continuously from different angles, maintaining a constant motion.Similarly, a three-phase power system ensures a constant and balanced power flow, resulting in higher efficiency and reliability, particularly beneficial for high-demand applications like bitcoin mining.The Evolution of Bitcoin Mining Power RequirementsBitcoin mining has come a long way since its inception, with significant changes in power requirements over the years. Before 2013, miners relied on CPUs and GPUs to mine bitcoins. The real game-changer came with the development of ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) miners as the bitcoin network grew and competition increased. These devices are specifically designed for the purpose of mining bitcoins, offering unparalleled efficiency and performance. However, the increased power requirements of these machines necessitated advancements in power supply systems.In 2016, a top-of-the-line miner was capable of computing 13 TH/s with a power consumption of approximately 1,300 watts (W). While considered highly inefficient by today’s standards, mining with this rig was profitable due to the low network competition at that time. However, to generate meaningful profits in today’s competitive landscape, institutional miners now rely on rigs that demand around 3,510 W.The limitations of single-phase power systems has come to the fore as the power requirements of ASIC and the efficiency demands of high-performance mining operations grows. The transition to three-phase power became a logical step to support the growing energy needs of the industry.


480v Three-Phase in Bitcoin MiningEfficiency First480v three-phase power has long been the standard in industrial settings across North America, South America, and other regions. This widespread adoption is due to its numerous benefits in terms of efficiency, cost savings, and scalability. The consistency and reliability of 480v three-phase power make it ideal for operations that demand greater operational uptime and fleet efficiency, especially in a post-halving world.One of the primary benefits of three-phase power is its ability to deliver higher power density, which reduces energy losses and ensures that mining equipment operates at optimal performance levels. Additionally, implementing a three-phase power system can lead to significant savings in electrical infrastructure costs. Fewer transformers, smaller wiring, and reduced need for voltage stabilization equipment contribute to lower installation and maintenance expenses.For example, a load requiring 17.3 kilowatts of power at 208v three-phase would need a current of 48 amps. However, if the same load is supplied by a 480v source, the current requirement drops to just 24 amps. This halving of the current not only reduces power loss but also minimizes the need for thicker, more expensive wiring​​.ScalabilityAs mining operations expand, the ability to easily add more capacity without major overhauls to the power infrastructure is crucial. The high availability of systems and components designed for 480v three-phase power makes it easier for miners to scale their operations efficiently​​. As the bitcoin mining industry evolves, there is a clear trend towards the development of more three-phase compliant ASICs. Designing mining facilities with a 480v three-phase configuration not only addresses current inefficiencies but also future-proofs the infrastructure. This allows miners to seamlessly integrate newer technologies that are likely to be designed with three-phase power compatibility in mind​​. As shown in the table below, the immersion-cooling and hydro-cooling techniques are superior methods in scaling up bitcoin mining operations in terms of reaching higher hashrate output. But to support such a much higher computation capacity, the configuration of three-phase power becomes necessary for maintaining a similar level of power efficiency. In short, this will lead to a higher operational profit with the same profit margin percentage. 


Implementing Three-Phase Power in Bitcoin Mining OperationsTransitioning to a three-phase power system requires careful planning and execution. Here are the key steps involved in implementing three-phase power in bitcoin mining operations.Assessing Power RequirementsThe first step in implementing a three-phase power system is to assess the power requirements of the mining operation. This involves calculating the total power consumption of all mining equipment and determining the appropriate capacity for the power system.Upgrading Electrical InfrastructureUpgrading the electrical infrastructure to support a three-phase power system may involve installing new transformers, wiring, and circuit breakers. It's essential to work with qualified electrical engineers to ensure that the installation meets safety and regulatory standards.Configuring ASIC Miners for Three-Phase PowerMany modern ASIC miners are designed to operate on three-phase power. However, older models may require modifications or the use of power conversion equipment. Configuring the miners to run on three-phase power is a critical step in maximizing efficiency.Implementing Redundancy and Backup SystemsTo ensure uninterrupted mining operations, it's essential to implement redundancy and backup systems. This includes installing backup generators, uninterruptible power supplies, and redundant power circuits to protect against power outages and equipment failures.Monitoring and MaintenanceOnce the three-phase power system is operational, continuous monitoring and maintenance are crucial to ensure optimal performance. Regular inspections, load balancing, and proactive maintenance can help identify and address potential issues before they impact operations.ConclusionThe future of bitcoin mining lies in the efficient utilization of power resources. As advancements in chip processing technologies reach their limits, focusing on power setup becomes increasingly critical. Three-phase power, particularly a 480v system, offers numerous advantages that can revolutionize bitcoin mining operations.By providing higher power density, improved efficiency, reduced infrastructure costs, and scalability, three-phase power systems can support the growing demands of the mining industry. Implementing such a system requires careful planning and execution, but the benefits far outweigh the challenges.As the bitcoin mining industry continues to evolve, embracing three-phase power can pave the way for more sustainable and profitable operations. With the right infrastructure in place, miners can harness the full potential of their equipment and stay ahead in the competitive world of bitcoin mining.This is a guest post by Christian Lucas, Strategy at Bitdeer.

Learn about Bitcoin vaults and their importance in the custody space.","Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, has come a long way from its informal past. From an experimental digital currency that occupied cypherpunk niches on the internet, it has grown to a trillion-dollar market cap asset valued at over $66,900 per coin as of this writing.While investing in Bitcoin is still considered a wild ride, the asset is quickly maturing. Financial institutions are closing in and creating hybrid vehicles to invest in cryptocurrency. The ecosystem reached a new milestone with the advent of Bitcoin ETFs, making people realize the immensity of Bitcoin’s potential in traditional markets and spurring new demand.As more people and institutions invest in Bitcoin, Bitcoin vaults become more crucial. Here, we examine the features and importance of Bitcoin vaults and how they contribute to ensuring a reliable infrastructure that promotes sustained value and investability. We explore their role in professionalized and institutional custody. Secure custodians are vital to protecting digital assets from theft and loss. This article also tracks the fast-advancing technology of Bitcoin vaults and how it relates to future developments in the custody space.What are Bitcoin vaults, and how do they work?Bitcoin vaults are offline digital asset storage solutions offering enhanced protection against online threats. This protection is created through multiple security layers.As the Bitcoin investment sphere grows, new products are being created. Bitcoin vaults are a critical component of these new financial products. While hot wallets and exchange accounts offer easy transaction access, they are vulnerable to hacks.Bitcoin vaults are fortified digital safes. They protect your Bitcoin by taking it offline and shielding it from the constant openness to online attacks. Their multiple layers of security include withdrawal delays, multi-signature or multisig authentication, and cold storage solutions.One highly secure approach to Bitcoin or crypto vaults is called air-gapping. Air-gapped storage offers robust protection against malware attacks, phishing scams, and unauthorized access. Many Bitcoin vaults integrate advanced encryption techniques. They typically require multiple authorizations for transactions to proceed. Advanced encryption and the need for layered authorization steps bolster security posture. As a Bitcoin investor, ensuring that your coins are kept in air-gapped and layered security vaults protects your investment and helps you hold it long-term.Vaults: Vital Components of Bitcoin CustodyBitcoin vaults are a component of Bitcoin custody solutions. Bitcoin custody is the entire process of holding and securing BTC. Because Bitcoin is a digital asset, it requires unique storage solutions to protect it from theft and loss. As BTC’s value rises, so does the interest from cybercriminals and hackers. Therefore, secure custody solutions are essential for protecting these digital assets.The Advanced Technology Behind Bitcoin VaultsThe following advanced technologies combine to create the security behind Bitcoin vaults. Understanding them helps you understand, evaluate, and appreciate their robustness. Cold StorageCold storage is a security method that keeps Bitcoin offline or away from internet-connected devices. Being offline reduces the risk of cyberattacks. Bitcoin cold storage is often used with multi-sig technology to provide maximum security.Multi-Signature TechnologyMulti-signature or multisig technology requires multiple private keys to authorize a Bitcoin transaction. This method implies that even as one key is compromised, the Bitcoin in the wallet cannot be transferred. The transaction still requires the other keys to be approved. Multisig technology enhances security by distributing ownership and control over Bitcoin. It makes it very challenging for a single entity to access or steal the assets.Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) are tamper-resistant and hardened devices that secure cryptographic processes. They generate, protect, and manage keys used for data encryption and decryption, as well as digital certificates and signatures.These specialized devices, in other words, are designed to protect and manage your digital keys. They provide a secure environment for cryptographic key generation, storage, and usage, ensuring that the private keys are never exposed to potential threats. HSMs are often used in Bitcoin vaults to enhance the security of the stored assets.HSMs are recommended for those with significant BTC holdings. They are also ideal for businesses handling Bitcoin and other crypto. While integration can be complex and require continued maintenance, the security benefits far outweigh the cost for those with high-value holdings.Furthermore, HSMS are tested, validated, and certified to the highest standards. They enable organizations to meet and exceed emerging and established regulatory requirements for cybersecurity.Companies Offering BTC Custody SolutionsAs Bitcoin and its related financial products gain popularity, so does the need for reliable custody. Companies that offer this service are called Bitcoin or crypto custodians and are a critical component of the digital asset industry. These companies or platforms offer secure BTC and crypto storage and provide services such as private key management, online security solutions, and transaction processing.Crypto custodians are gaining prominence as the cryptocurrency market grows. They are essential in ensuring that assets are stored and managed securely. Moreover, they protect investors' funds by providing layers of security beyond what public wallets or exchanges offer. However, it must be noted that exchanges, trading desks, and investment platforms run their own custody solutions. In addition, some exchanges are also the most noted custody providers. Examples of top custody providers, most of which offer investment access, include Swan Bitcoin, BitGo, Coinbase Custody, Anchorage, Gemini Custody, Bakkt, and Bitcoin Suisse. How To Choose Among BTC Custody ProvidersSeveral companies are competing in the crypto custody market. If you are a regular BTC trader or investor, you might be curious about how to choose what works for you.

Platforms should enable users to buy and store Bitcoin easily. While popular exchanges like Binance and Kraken offer a wide range of services, including retail buying and selling of crypto, they have downsides. They may not provide the best storage options for your crypto, and they may be more vulnerable and open to various hacks.Long-term BTC investors usually shun day trading and prefer the buy-and-hold strategy. Swan Bitcoin is a low-fee platform specializing in BTC-specific investments. It offers a full suite of BTC financial services, including Swan Vault, simplifying BTC storage for users. If you're curious how it compares to large global exchanges, check out the Kraken review on Swan Bitcoin’s site. The best Bitcoin vaults give you complete control over your coins, with user-friendly and straightforward features for setup, deposits, and withdrawals. They use the most reliable hardware to provide users with the most robust security. An example of such hardware is the Blockstream Jade signing device, a hardware wallet used by Swan Bitcoin to ensure BTC owners' full access to keys offline. You need signing devices that store two private keys to unlock a Swan Vault. Swan manages a third key called the Cloud Key, which is recommended for use as a second key to prevent bringing both hardware signing devices to the same location. Bitcoin vaults must have sound recovery strategies for BTC theft or loss, as 72-hour holds for Cloud Key withdrawals. Moreover, these vaults need to offer comprehensive support services, including secure storage of spare keys to assist you in moving funds and customer support manned by trained specialists. When Investing in BTC, Choose a Reliable CustodianBitcoin vaults are becoming increasingly important as more people and institutions invest in Bitcoin. As digital assets gain legitimacy through legalized financial products, security custody solutions become increasingly vital to protect them from theft and loss. By leveraging advanced technologies such as multi-signature authentication, cold storage, and Hardware Security Modules, Bitcoin vaults provide a robust security solution for digital assets. In addition, multi-layered features ensure secure storage of private keys and means of recovery in case keys are lost or stolen. Bitcoin vaults are not just meant to store BTC securely. They form the bedrock of the asset's long-term viability as an investment vehicle. It is not enough to leave the knowledge to technical experts or institutions.

Bitcoin Magazine,"El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office Celebrates 21 Months of Success, Sets Stage for Renaissance 2.0","Wed, 11 Sep 2024 15:31:02 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvadors-bitcoin-office-celebrates-21-months-of-success-sets-stage-for-renaissance-2-0,"The National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) of the Office of the President of El Salvador, led by Stacy Herbert, aims not just to help further integrate Bitcoin into El Salvador’s economy but foster a cultural, artistic and psychological renaissance.","“Someone needs to be the keeper and reiterator of the vision. There's a ton of work to do. When you have to walk a thousand miles and have only taken the first step, it feels like a long way. It really helps if there is someone saying, ‘We are one step closer, and the goal is not a mirage.’” -Steve JobsStacy Herbert, Director of the National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) of the Office of the President of El Salvador, shared the above quote with me, while beaming with both pride and resolve, at the onset of my interview with her.It’s clear that Herbert is on a mission, a mission that started in 2010 when she and her partner, Max Keiser, first discovered Bitcoin and became some of the earliest spokespeople for it soon after. This mission now includes the President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, as well as the bureaucracy and citizens of El Salvador, which has colloquially become known as “Bitcoin country” in Bitcoin circles.By many metrics, The Bitcoin Office has already achieved much success since its founding in December 2022. It’s stockpiled 5,836 bitcoin on behalf of the country. It’s educated 80,000 Salvadoran civil servants on what Bitcoin is and why it’s important. It’s helped implement Bitcoin education from kindergarten to university levels through programs like Mi Primer Bitcoin and CUBO+. And it’s attracted entrepreneurs, investors and other bright minds to the country.While Herbert is proud of these accomplishments, she’s not one to rest on her laurels, especially since she believes that El Salvador’s best days still lie ahead. She has a vision that further Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador will set the stage for a new renaissance, one that will uplift Salvadorans and continue to attract the world’s best to the country. Given the obstacles she’s overcome since first arriving in the country three years ago, it’s difficult to believe she won’t continue to do her part to make this new era for El Salvador happen.Getting Started in El SalvadorHerbert arrived with Keiser in El Salvador toward the latter part of 2021, near the height of that same year’s bitcoin bull market. Euphoria gave way to despair into 2022, though, when bitcoin’s price tanked in part as a result of broader meltdown in the crypto space.“When we first arrived three years ago, bitcoin hit $69,000 and then it proceeded to tumble down to something like $16,000,” Herbert told Bitcoin Magazine.This left Herbert and Keiser tasked with the challenge of explaining to Salvadorans that the collapse of major crypto companies didn’t mean that Bitcoin was dead, nor that it was a mirage.“FTX collapsed, BlockFi collapsed, and Celsius collapsed,” explained Herbert. “When they saw all those collapses, they thought that it was the same thing as Bitcoin — all these scams, all these frauds.”Herbert recalled the importance of steering El Salvador in a bitcoin-not-crypto path at that time.“There were two paths: You could be crypto country or you could be Bitcoin country,” said Herbert.“With crypto country, you're competing with Vegas; you're competing with Macau. The house always wins in those situations. And that's the same thing if you have a crypto economy. You have some wealthy guys who run the house. The pre-mines, the chip owners, the chip dispensers, they always win,” she added, making the point that she didn’t want to see El Salvador exploited by the crypto industry.“Or you could go down the route of what Switzerland was to gold, or New York became to US Treasuries. You could build capital markets. You could build an economy. You could build a Singapore 2.0, an Alexandria 2.0, a Florence 2.0. We pushed for this vision.”Renaissance 2.0In the vision that Herbert shares with President Bukele and Keiser, a senior advisor to Bukele, El Salvador is in the early stages of ushering in one of the greatest eras of human flourishing the world has ever seen.Much like the Renaissance, which occurred in what is now northern Italy just over 500 years ago, El Salvador is setting the stage for its own explosion of entrepreneurship and creativity by adopting that hardest money ever known to man.“Florence first didn't just didn't have DaVinci and Michelangelo and Botticelli and all of the architects, the discoverers, the explorers, the astronomers, and then find perfect money,” explained Herbert. “They found the perfect money of the time — the Florin — and that led to a positive feedback loop of ever more wealth concentrating in Florence versus the other city states of what is now Italy and other regions across Europe,” she added, before sharing that great artists, businesspeople and thinkers flocked to Florence in the wake of its becoming a commercial center.“We think that same sort of process could happen in El Salvador.”Embracing Bukele’s VisionHerbert shared repeatedly in our discussion how El Salvador’s transformation couldn’t have happened without the leadership of Bukele, whose approval rating amongst Salvadorans is still above 90%, making him one of the most popular presidents in the world.A challenge for the ONBTC now, she claims, is getting the rest of the country to see and embrace his vision.“You can't just have President Bukele [believing in Bitcoin],” explained Herbert.“You need at least a portion of his 80,000 civil servants to understand what he is actually trying to achieve. Remember, as the keeper of the vision, we have to pull everybody along to understand President Bukele's vision for El Salvador,” she added.In efforts to get the rest of the country on board, Herbert has hired well-known Bitcoin figures to educate and train Salvadoran Bitcoin developers as well as members of the Salvadoran government.This work started with Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song coming to El Salvador in March 2022 (before the ONBTC was officially established) to teach developers how to work on Bitcoin Core.“Jimmy Song taught his Bitcoin course to seven Salvadorans,” recalled Herbert. “One of them was a guy named Mario Flamenco, who ended up becoming my assistant, my number two at the Bitcoin office.”Giacomo Zucco also came on board to not only teach developers, but also provided three days of Bitcoin education to El Salvador’s civil servants. Herbert explained that the educational efforts are not just to provide El Salvador’s bureaucrats with a deep technical knowledge of Bitcoin, but to reshape their mindset.“They're the people that interact with the population,” said Herbert of El Salvador’s civil servants, “so, they need to understand why they are Bitcoin country in terms of the mindset.”Herbert often referred to the importance of mindset during our discussion. She explained that the work the ONBTC does is about more than just helping people to understand what Bitcoin is, but it’s about mentally and emotionally prepping them to be great.“In order to be extraordinary, [you have to have] people in the government and in the population who are ready to be extraordinary,” she said.“We're training a population to have the mindset to be Florence 2.0, to be Singapore 2.0 — to be something extraordinary,” she added.“You need everybody to be on the same page in terms of just how important they are. What we're doing here is extraordinary. What President Bukele has delivered to the country is quite extraordinary.”Passport ProgramsThrough ONBTC, Bukele is prepping Salvadorans for great things, while through El Salvador’s passport programs, he’s looking to attract those who have a track record of doing great things.On April 6, 2024, Bukele announced that El Salvador would issue 5,000 passports to the likes of scientists, doctors and even philosophers.We're offering 5,000 free passports (equivalent to $5 billion in our passport program) to highly skilled scientists, engineers, doctors, artists, and philosophers from abroad.This represents less than 0.1% of our population, so granting them full citizen status, including…— Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) April 6, 2024

As Bukele shared in his tweet, these 5,000 passports are technically worth $5 billion. El Salvador now issues passports nearly instantly for those who make a $1 million investment in the country with either BTC or USDT.While this program was designed to attract top talent from abroad, it also had positive effects on the psychology of the Salvadoran people, according to Herbert.“What we did with the million dollar price tag worked,” said Herbert. “If you go back, Salvadoran people started saying, ‘My God, some people were paying $10,000 to coyotes to take them over the border in the US, and my passport is worth $1 million.' Even if a thousand Salvadorans think that, it changes the mindset enough that it's a critical seed of change,” she added.What’s Next for The Bitcoin Office?Herbert said that ONBTC has some big announcements coming in the next three to four weeks. For now, though, the ONBTC is focused on unveiling the first Bitcoin banks, which she believes will help El Salvador build capital markets.“Bitcoin banks will come here, and we'll start seriously building the capital markets that are needed — like we've laid the foundation for greatness over the past 21 months,” said Herbert.Beyond Bitcoin banks, Herbert seems confident that the sky's the limit as far as what comes next for El Salvador. Thanks to the ONBTC, a foundation has been set for the revitalization of the country.“We have the education, we have the mindset, we have the rebrand — the greatest rebrand in history — as I call it for El Salvador, and we have an increasing amount of popularity for President Bukele, because he keeps winning,” she said. “We’ve walked a thousand miles in the last 21 months, and we now have another thousand-mile journey to start.”Editor’s note: We normally profile founders of startups for our Founders series, but, this week, we chose to profile the head of a government institution who's led that institutions since its inception."
Bitcoin Magazine,Early Bitcoin Developer Backs Satoshi Nakamoto Theory,"Wed, 11 Sep 2024 13:00:00 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/lone-genius-bitcoin-developer-satoshi-nakamoto-theory,A Bitcoin developer from 2010 has gone public with his support for a theory about the project's anonymous founder.,"Jeff Garzik, a veteran Linux contributor and early open-source developer who contributed to the Bitcoin project from 2010 to 2017, has released a series of new videos detailing his time working with Bitcoin’s anonymous inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. Joining the project in July 2010, Garzik contributed to early software releases, entering notable pull requests including the first proposal to raise the block size limit, as well as the first proposal to eliminate subsidies for free transactions. Under Satoshi’s time as maintainer, Garzik had pull requests accepted, including for work separating the mining code from the Satoshi client.Most notably, the new videos find Garzik sharing recollections about his time with Satoshi, including new commentary on whether Satoshi was indeed a singular individual or a group.""Satoshi as a coder, he’s more the ‘A Beautiful Mind’ type lone genius,” Garzik recalls. “When I was a computer science major, we thought highly of ourselves as coders, and we would notice that some of the other disciplines, the chemists, the biologists, the physicists, they had to do it, but they didn’t approach it as a profession. Satoshi was the same way.”In this way, Garzik says he believes Satoshi knew what problem he wanted to solve, but that lacked an understanding of “modularity,” “unit testing,” and other basics that “computer science majors learn.”“He very wisely pulled cryptographic solutions off the shelf that were well known, well studied, and he put all those together in a new and interesting way,” Garzik said, adding:“My impression was that he studied existing people on the internet and tried to think how to combine existing crypto primitives in field use to create Bitcoin.”Elsewhere, Garzik attested to his belief that Satoshi was a “self-taught” programmer, arguing Bitcoin’s founder was humble about his limitations. In other statements he spoke to Satoshi’s temperament and working methods, noting his strict focus on Bitcoin.“Satoshi would never stray from that topic. He would never let slip any personal information whatsoever, never talk about his mood, the time of day,” he says in one clip. “It was always 100% all about Bitcoin.”All told, the recollections cover a period of 6 months through Nakamoto’s resignation from the project in January 2011, at which point Garzik’s friend and collaborator Gavin Andresen took over as lead maintainer. The videos come during a year in which other early Bitcoin contributors have gone public in releasing correspondence with Satoshi, with Martti ‘Sirius’ Malmi and Adam Back publishing hundreds of pages of never-before-seen emails in connection with a public trial in the U.K.While Garzik has yet to release emails with Satoshi, the videos, produced by a new venture he founded, Hemi Network, represent the most public discussion the developer has had on the subject in some time. Launched in July, the Hemi Network is advertised as “a modular Layer-2 protocol for superior scaling, security, and interoperability, powered by Bitcoin and Ethereum.” The work follows a period after 2017 in which Garzik has become more interested in blockchain networks that are not tied to any specific base layer cryptocurrency, a path that includes Metronome, a project from 2017 that also sought compatibility with multiple blockchains.Garzik left the Bitcoin project that year after serving as the lead maintainer for a hard fork of the Bitcoin protocol that despite early startup ecosystem support never formally launched. The full video playlist can be accessed below:"

The Bitcoin difficulty chart plots the historical increases and decreases in mining difficulty over time. It measures how hard it is for miners to find a valid hash for the next block. Higher difficulty requires more computing power to mine new Bitcoin.When combined with the Bitcoin price, difficulty helps determine miners' profitability and return on investment. The metric soared in 2024 amid massive growth in Bitcoin's overall hash rate and adoption.The rising difficulty shows intensifying competition on the Bitcoin network as more miners fight for limited block rewards. This is generally constructive for network security and decentralization.Despite rough market conditions this year, the difficulty increase displays the unprecedented demand for Bitcoin block rewards. It underlines the incredible security offered by the collective computing power of miners around the world.The difficulty adjustment algorithm built into Bitcoin's code dictates the pace of change in mining competition. It is programmed to find blocks approximately every 10 minutes, maintaining a steady influx of new Bitcoin over time.This predictable Bitcoin issuance schedule makes its inflation rate easy to model and appeals to investors compared to fiat currencies subject to central bank policies."

Crypto Potato,Hackers Steal $243 Million In Bitcoin Scam – But Doxxed Themselves On Discord,"Thu, 19 Sep 2024 19:47:43 +0000",https://cryptopotato.com/hackers-steal-243-million-in-bitcoin-scam-but-doxxed-themselves-on-discord/,The culprits stole nearly 4100 BTC and spent it on luxury goods before being arrested this week.,"Blockchain detective ZachXBT has exposed another set of hackers who used a social engineering scam to steal over $240 million in Bitcoin from a wealthy victim.
The investigator said that both his efforts and the criminals’ own blunders have already led to “multiple arrests and millions frozen.”
Scammed For 4000 BTC
In mid-August, the scammers targeted a single creditor to Genesis – the institutional Bitcoin trading desk that went bankrupt in early 2023.
First, the scammers called the victim pretending to be Google support using a spoofed phone number and gained access to the victim’s personal accounts. They then called again pretending to be Gemini support, warning the victim that their accounts were hacked.
Through this, they prompted the victim to reset his two-factor authentication and send his Gemini funds to a compromised wallet. Meanwhile, the scammers fooled the victim into downloading the remote desktop application AnyDesk, which let them see the victim’s screen, and view his private key via Bitcoin Core.
The hackers recorded their audio and screens as they celebrated pulling off the hack, which netted them 4,064 BTC worth $257 million at today’s price.
“An initial tracing showed $243M split multiple ways between each party before funds quickly peeled off to 15+ exchanges immediately swapping back and forth between Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Monero,” added ZachXBT.
Identifying The Culprits
The investigator linked the distribution of the funds to the wallets of the parties involved with the theft. One of the three main culprits who went by “Wiz” was identified as Veer Chetal after he mistakenly leaked his full name during a screenshare.
Chetal’s friend Light also leaked his real name, Aakaash, during a screen share. Greavys, whose real name is Malone Lam and was responsible for finding details related to the target in his mail, spent much of his stolen money on luxury cars, nightclubs, and giving Birkin bags to girls.
Box (Jeandhil Serrano), the man who called the victim as a pretend Gemini exchange rep, also spent much of his funds on luxury goods. However, ZachXBT said both Box and Greavys mistakenly linked their “dirty funds” connected to centralized exchanges with their funds that were supposed to be private on multiple occasions.
Yesterday evening, both Box and Greavys were arrested in Miami and LA. Over million of their stolen funds have been seized with help from Binance, and $500,000 has been returned back to the victim.
An indictment of the case against both individuals was unsealed later on Thursday.

[&#8230;]","[PRESS RELEASE – Singapore, Asia, September 19th, 2024]
Harvard Students and Alumni Launch Groundbreaking Native Bitcoin Blockchain Project at Harvard Innovation Labs to Tackle Global Debt Crisis 

 Launch of “New Bretton Woods Project” (NBW): A Harvard-led initiative, soon to be incubated at Harvard Innovation Labs, tackling the global debt crisis through decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions.
 Native Bitcoin Stablecoin: NBW is developing a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin via BeL2 infrastructure, offering stability while preserving Bitcoin’s decentralization and security.
 Economic Disruption and Resilience: The project aims to reshape global finance by leveraging Bitcoin and DeFi to promote economic stability and empower users in the face of rising global debt.

In a bold step to transform the global financial landscape, the Digital Economy Research Initiative, led by a dynamic group of Harvard students and alumni, has officially launched the “New Bretton Woods Project” (NBW). This pioneering blockchain-based initiative has secured membership in Harvard’s prestigious Innovation Labs and is set to begin incubation there in the coming weeks. NBW aims to tackle the escalating global debt crisis by offering innovative, technology-driven solutions.
At the heart of the project is the development of a native Bitcoin stablecoin, leveraging the transformative potential of decentralized finance (DeFi). Built on the innovative BeL2 infrastructure, NBW aims to reshape global financial systems, unlocking new possibilities for debt management and financial stability across nations.
With the power of DeFi and blockchain, NBW stands poised to disrupt the status quo, offering a bold new path toward economic resilience in the face of one of the greatest challenges of our time. This initiative signals not just a step, but a leap toward a decentralized, stable and secure economic future.
The project reframes Bitcoin as not just a store of value but the foundation of a decentralized financial system. Using BeL2—Bitcoin’s second-layer solution—the NBW project enables smart contracts for Bitcoin-backed stablecoin construction, empowering users to engage in decentralized finance while preserving Bitcoin’s core principles of decentralization and security.
“Harvard Innovation Labs will help turn our vision into reality,” said Jacob, Lead Member of New Bretton Woods (NBW) at Harvard University. “Our goal is to create a ‘New Bretton Woods’ system anchored in Bitcoin, bringing stability through the utility of a stablecoin. This stablecoin allows users to bypass Bitcoin’s price volatility while retaining the potential for long-term gain, making the product practical for daily use.”
The native Bitcoin stablecoin will be fully backed by Bitcoin, enabling users to experience the stability of fiat currency without liquidating their Bitcoin holdings. This offers a balance of algorithmic security using Bitcoin miners and the opportunity for long-term growth.
The BeL2 infrastructure allows for decentralized finance applications, where Bitcoin remains securely on the main network. Bitcoin can be used as collateral for Layer 2 applications such as decentralized exchanges, loans, and stablecoin issuance. The NBW team ensures that all Bitcoin-related settlements occur on the Bitcoin main network for maximum security. Instead of transferring assets across chains, messages are sent to Ethereum-compatible networks to issue stablecoin, uniting technologies and supporting a robust decentralized economy.
“Financial empowerment comes from both freedom and stability,” added Sasha Mitchell, Head of Operations at BeL2. “By offering a stablecoin backed by Bitcoin on the BeL2 platform, NBW is giving people a way to protect their wealth and access new financial opportunities, especially in times of economic volatility.”
“This initiative comes at a crucial time as global debt reaches record levels. By combining Bitcoin’s decentralized structure with the stability of a pegged currency, the project offers a financial system that mitigates the risks of traditional economies, highlighting the real-world benefits of financial security and sovereignty. Our stablecoin isn’t just another digital currency; it’s a tool for global financial stability,” said Jacob, Lead Member of the NBW project. “We believe that offering a decentralized and stable currency helps individuals and communities navigate the growing challenges posed by the global debt crisis.”
The NBW team invites those who share their vision for a decentralized and secure financial future to explore how they can contribute. Whether you’re a developer, an investor, or a policymaker interested in sustainable financial solutions, this project offers a unique chance to shape a future focused on security, accessibility, and freedom.
About New Bretton Woods Project (NBW) 
The project is led by Digital Economy Research Initiative, a team of Harvard students and alumni. NBW is set to be incubated at Harvard Innovation Labs in the coming weeks. Focused on bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems, the team is committed to advancing financial inclusivity and economic stability.
About Harvard Innovation Labs 
Harvard Innovation Labs is a collaborative ecosystem that supports entrepreneurship across Harvard University. It provides resources, mentorship, and funding to students, faculty, and alumni as they develop practical solutions in fields like technology and finance.
About BeL2

Crypto Potato,Bitcoin Whales Signal Confidence as Net Inflows Remain Positive,"Thu, 19 Sep 2024 17:19:08 +0000",https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-whales-signal-confidence-as-net-inflows-remain-positive/,The last instance of weekly negative flow among these whales occurred in May.,"Despite a slowdown in Bitcoin (BTC) whale accumulation, the weekly net flows among these large holders (addresses with at least 1,000 BTC) have remained positive for nearly four months.
Positive net flows indicate that more BTC is entering these wallets than leaving, suggesting potential buying pressure, while negative net flows mean more BTC is flowing out of these entities.
Whales See Consistent Inflow
According to data from IntoTheBlock, the weekly net inflow peaked at 27K BTC (worth approximately $1.7 billion in current prices) in June. Subsequently, whales experienced a weekly inflow of 19K BTC ($1.2 billion) in July, 18K BTC ($1.13 billion) in August, and 9K BTC ($556.9 million) in September.
The last time these wallets experienced negative net flows was in May, according to ITB.

Although $BTC whale accumulation has decelerated, the weekly net flow has stayed positive for nearly four months.

Bullish on Bitcoin
Bitcoin whales are known to be crucial market signals. The sustained positive net flows from whales’ wallets suggest a bullish indicator for the digital asset. More BTC going into these wallets than flowing out suggests that they are confident in the future market value of the leading crypto asset.
However, it is important to note that the pace of Bitcoin whale accumulation has decelerated compared to earlier this year. This, on the other hand, can be seen as a bearish signal.
While data from IntoTheBlock suggests a slowdown in whales’ accumulation, it also noted that these long-term holders’ BTC stashes have recently stabilized. According to the on-chain analytics platforms, long-term holders currently possess 12.6 million BTC, valued at $793.674 billion.
Earlier this month, CryptoPotato reported that Bitcoin wallets with at least 100 BTC hit a 17-month high. This surge was propelled by 283 new wallets holding 100 BTC or more over the past month.
Bitcoin trades at $63,000 at press time, representing a 5% surge on the day and a 9% increase over the past week.

[…]The postLouisiana continues pro-crypto push with option to pay state agencies in Bitcoin, USDCappeared first onCryptoSlate.","Louisiana has implemented a new option for residents to make payments to state agencies using Bitcoin and Circle’s stablecoin USDC, according to a Sept. 18 press release.
The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries will be the first agency to accept these payments, with the possibility of expansion to other state departments in the future. Secretary Madison Sheahan said offering digital payment options aligns with the department’s goal of enhancing customer service.
The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries has already processed the first payment through the new system and received a payment via the Bitcoin Lightning network.
Louisiana State Treasurer John Fleming said the transition aims to provide residents with more flexibility while ensuring that the state remains protected from the volatility of crypto markets. As such, payments made in crypto will be converted into US dollars at the time of the transaction.
Fleming said:
“By introducing cryptocurrency as a payment option, we are providing another way for citizens to interact with state services while maintaining safeguards to ensure the state’s financial stability.”
The system will be supported by Bead Pay, a company specializing in crypto payments. The firm will facilitate the conversion of digital currencies into US dollars. The state will not hold cryptocurrency directly, and funds will be deposited into state accounts similarly to traditional debit or credit card transactions.
State Representative Mark Wright (R-Covington), who has been a proponent of digital assets legislation, welcomed the expansion of payment options, saying:
“This is a positive step forward in offering new technologies for residents to engage with state government.”
Lousiana’s pro-Bitcoin push
The move to accept crypto payments for state services follows a series of pro-crypto policies by the Louisiana government. Earlier this year, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry signed a bill banning central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and safeguarding the rights of residents to self-custody and mine crypto.
The bill, HB 488, prohibited state authorities from participating in federal tests related to CBDCs and ensured that individuals and businesses could freely use and store crypto. The legislation also protected home and commercial crypto mining activities, positioning Louisiana as a state open to innovation in the digital asset space.
The latest move to integrate cryptocurrency payments with state services builds on this momentum, highlighting the state’s broader commitment to embracing digital financial technologies while balancing regulatory oversight.

According to FalconX head of research David Lawant, the high volume paired with the liquidity setup shown in the past six months could be a sign of impending high volatility.
‘Coiled spring’
Lawant noted that the current spot volume is nearly 30% higher than the daily average during August, which indicates that liquidity is significantly stronger during periods of recovery compared to sell-offs.
He echoed the sentiment recently shared by Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, saying that liquidity dynamics in the crypto market look like a “coiled spring.”
Glassnode also compared BTC’s current price action to a coiling spring in a report published before the Fed’s decision.
According to the report, the coiled spring setup was formed because the price has been compressed within “a well-defined range” over the past six months. Historically, only August 2023 and May 2016 registered a 180-day price range tighter than the current one.
It added that macro events like the Fed’s interest rate cut release the “pressure” built up over the period, which often leads to high market volatility.
Additionally, CryptoQuant CEO and founder Ki Young Ju highlighted that institutions are not shorting Bitcoin aggressively, which is another improvement in market conditions. He added that CME futures net positions have fallen 75% since April, and are close to early October 2023 levels.
Potential for a burst
Glassnode also noted that both inflows and outflows from the market have become mute, which indicated that Bitcoin has entered a state of “equilibrium.”
Furthermore, net realized profit and loss are “largely equal,” and the absolute realized profit plus loss has declined significantly since Bitcoin’s all-time high in March. Both metrics suggest that buy-side pressure is low in the current price range, which translates to low demand for Bitcoin.
Glassnode also noted that the “Hot Supply” of Bitcoin, a metric used to define BTC holdings that are more likely to be transferred, is at a significantly low level. These wallets represent only 4.7% of the on-chain value, which suggests that the supply side is also constricted.
The report also highlighted that the rising stablecoin supply, currently at $160.4 billion, could break this predicament by adding purchasing power to the market, which would result in ultimate friction between inactivity and demand.
However, the report added that this supply must rotate in the market for this to happen, triggering the coiled spring mentioned by analysts.

Currently, the best-performing miner on the market is the Bitmain S21 Pro, which runs at 234TH/s. The new miner is over three times more powerful and 3 J/TH more efficient.
Per the announcement, the partnership between Hut 8 and Bitmain extends beyond procurement. The companies collaborated on both technical and commercial aspects, with Hut 8 contributing to the miner’s development.
The hosting agreement features a fixed hosting fee and provides Hut 8 with an option to purchase all or part of the hosted machines within six months of their activation. This structure is designed to reduce upfront capital requirements and allow Hut 8 to assess market conditions before committing additional funds. If Hut 8 exercises this option fully, its self-mining hashrate could increase from 5.6 EH/s to approximately 20.6 EH/s.
Bitmain’s Vice President of Mining, Irene Gao, acknowledged Hut 8’s role in the development process, noting the company’s focus on cost-efficient procurement and operations. The collaboration is seen as a natural evolution of their relationship, aiming to define the future of mining technology.
Hut 8’s Chief Executive Officer, Asher Genoot, emphasized the innovative nature of the hosting agreement and its benefits, stating,
“Our team worked closely with BITMAIN to implement an innovative structure to commercialize the U3S21EXPH before it became available to the broader market.”
The deployment of the U3S21EXPH and the associated hosting agreement represent a strategic move for Hut 8. By integrating advanced cooling technologies and flexible procurement strategies, the company seeks to enhance its operational capabilities and financial performance.

These economic indicators suggest strengthening labor market and manufacturing activity, which can boost investor confidence. A robust economy may encourage investment in risk assets, including Bitcoin. Positive job numbers can lead to higher disposable income and increased market participation.
The rate cut announced yesterday by the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by 50 basis points, leading Bitcoin to climb from $59,000 to $62,000. Lower interest rates decrease the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like Bitcoin, making them more attractive to investors.

Crypto News,Donald Trump Becomes First Former US President to Use Bitcoin in NYC Restaurant,"Thu, 19 Sep 2024 08:23:24 +0000",https://cryptonews.com/news/donald-trump-becomes-first-former-us-president-to-use-bitcoin-in-nyc-restaurant/,Donald Trump has become the first former US president to use Bitcoin in a New York City bar and restaurant known for accepting the cryptocurrency.The postDonald Trump Becomes First Former US President to Use Bitcoin in NYC Restaurantappeared first onCryptonews.,"
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has become the first former US president to use Bitcoin in a New York City bar and restaurant known for accepting the cryptocurrency.
On September 18, Trump reportedly purchased hamburgers using Bitcoin at Pubkey, an NYC establishment, during a campaign event, according to a post by Pubkey on X.
Alongside Trump, other notable figures, including BTC advocate and Professional Capital Management CEO Anthony Pompliano, also attended the event.
Trump Buys Burger for Attendees
Videos shared on X show Trump buying at least a dozen hamburgers. He distributed them to attendees, referring to them as “crypto burgers.”

The appearance comes shortly after Trump announced the launch of a token through the World Liberty Financial crypto platform, managed by his family members.
Notably, World Liberty Financial will be a crypto banking ecosystem where users can borrow, lend, and invest in cryptocurrencies.
The project will sell a non-transferable governance token called WLFI and plans to limit participation to accredited investors.
The token structure will see 20% of the tokens reserved for the founding team, 17% set aside for user rewards, and the remaining 63% available to the public.
Despite previously labeling Bitcoin a “scam” and describing cryptocurrencies as “based on thin air,” the former president has shifted his tone.
His 2024 campaign has shown support for Bitcoin miners and included an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville.
Trump’s involvement with Bitcoin is notable given that he reportedly holds at least $1 million in cryptocurrency assets.
His use of Bitcoin at the event marks a significant moment, especially considering that another former president, Bill Clinton, has also held Bitcoin since it was given to him at a 2016 event.
Harris Avoids Crypto
In contrast to Trump, Vice President Kamala Harris has not made cryptocurrency a focal point of her campaign.
However, Future Forward, a political action committee supporting the Democratic candidate, does accept cryptocurrency donations, indicating a nuanced approach to digital assets within the party.
Just recently, investment Bank Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick said Bitcoin is expected to end the year at new all-time highs regardless of who wins the US election.
Kendrick suggested that Bitcoin could reach new all-time highs by the end of 2024 due to “positive drivers dominating regardless of the election outcome.”
“I think Bitcoin ends the year higher, at new all-time highs, no matter who wins the U.S. election, with a Trump win taking it to $125,000 and $75,000 if it’s Harris.”
It is worth noting that Harris’ chances of winning the upcoming U.S. presidential election surged on Polymarket following her debate with Trump last week.
As of now, Harris’ chance of winning the upcoming election stands at 52%, ahead of Trump at 46%.
The surge came after the recent debate, which touched on key national issues such as the war in Gaza and abortion rights.
Following the event, 94% of bettors on Polymarket believed Harris won the debate.

Crypto News,Rich Dad Poor Dad Author Kiyosaki Predicts Bitcoin Boom – Could Soaring Inflation Push BTC Price to New ATH? ,"Thu, 19 Sep 2024 02:46:15 +0000",https://cryptonews.com/news/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-kiyosaki-predicts-bitcoin/,"Robert Kiyosaki predicts a Bitcoin boom fueled by soaring inflation and potential Federal Reserve pivots, urging investors to act before BTC reaches new all-time highs.The postRich Dad Poor Dad Author Kiyosaki Predicts Bitcoin Boom – Could Soaring Inflation Push BTC Price to New ATH?appeared first onCryptonews.","
Robert Kiyosaki, the renowned author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has never shied away from offering bold financial predictions, and his latest one involves Bitcoin (BTC). 
In a recent tweet, Kiyosaki emphasized that a Bitcoin boom may be on the horizon, driven in part by escalating inflation and a possible shift in the Federal Reserve’s policies. 
He likens this impending surge in BTC to the rising value of other real assets such as gold and silver, assets which, according to him, could skyrocket when the Fed pivots to lowering interest rates.

Bitcoin, gold, silver prices about toEXPLODE….As stated in my previous tweet…. you talkers….cowards discussing which is better…. Gold or Bitcoin…will be Big Losers… when Marxist  Fed PIVOTS…cutting interest rates…and real assets go up in price…as fake money leaves fake…— Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) September 14, 2024

Kiyosaki’s financial philosophy has long revolved around the idea of investing in tangible assets—ones that hold intrinsic value over time. With U.S. bonds and fiat currencies losing credibility, he argues that “fake money” will leave “fake assets” and seek refuge in “real assets” like Bitcoin, gold, and silver. 
This is especially true, he believes, as inflation continues to erode the value of cash, and the Federal Reserve eventually reduces interest rates to spur economic activity.
In his typical straightforward style, Kiyosaki warns that people who debate whether Bitcoin is better than gold will be left behind—what he refers to as “loser talk.” He urges investors to stop theorizing and start acting by acquiring more of these real assets before it’s too late.
Ultimately, Kiyosaki’s message is clear: those who own assets like Bitcoin and gold will not only preserve their wealth but potentially grow it as inflation accelerates and interest rates drop. The question is not if Bitcoin will rise, but when, and for Kiyosaki, that moment could be coming soon.
Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Daily Technical Outlook – September 19, 2024
Bitcoin (BTC/USD) chart shows strong upward momentum after breaking through the key resistance level of $61,326. A sharp green candlestick indicates a significant bullish move, signaling renewed buying interest. 
The price has now risen above the 50-period EMA (Exponential Moving Average) at $59,709, further confirming this bullish trend.
The RSI (Relative Strength Index) also indicates strength, currently hovering around 70, which suggests that Bitcoin is nearing overbought conditions. However, the RSI is not yet in extreme territory, meaning there may still be room for further price increases.

The next resistance level to watch is $62,618. If Bitcoin breaks above this point, the upward momentum could accelerate, potentially pushing BTC toward the next resistance at $63,605. 
On the downside, $61,326 now acts as strong support, and failure to hold this level could trigger a retest of lower supports near $60,217 or even $59,709.

Trump, currently campaigning for a third presidential run, has actively sought the backing of the cryptocurrency industry in recent months. His efforts include addressing an industry conference and pledging to establish the United States as the “crypto capital of the planet.” 
The former President’s willingness to engage with cryptocurrencies, as evidenced by his recent Bitcoin purchase, raises questions about the evolving role of digital currencies in politics and potential future campaign finance strategies.

Hemi Labs, the brainchild of former Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik, announced on September 18 that it raised $15 million in a funding round to develop its new blockchain network, Hemi.
Binance Labs, Breyer Capital, and Big Brain Holdings led the first fundraising round, backing plans to combine the powers of Bitcoin and Ethereum into one “supernetwork.” 

The Hemi team is proud to announce the closing of its $15M strategic seed round, led by @binancelabs, @breyercap, and @BigBrainVC. Excited for what's to come!https://t.co/E1zxMW6VqC #bitcoin #ethereum pic.twitter.com/P4T1apIE3j— Hemi Network (@hemi_xyz) September 18, 2024

Co-founder Max Sanchez said the company plans to use these funds to expand Hemi’s engineering team, add more Bitcoin interoperability features, and offer developers advanced customizability, incentivization, grants, and community adoption.
What Hemi Labs Brings to the Table 
Hemi Labs seeks to tackle a multi-billion dollar problem in the DeFi space, addressing the $2.8 billion lost in DeFi bridge hacks by 2024. The company opposes centralized bridges that “reintroduce trust into a supposedly trustless system,” the firm added in an X thread.
The Hemi Bitcoin Kit (hBK) is another innovation from Hemi Labs, designed to enable developers to work with Bitcoin more effectively. 
This kit unlocks features such as trustless smart contracts and decentralized financial products, which were previously difficult to implement directly on the Bitcoin network. 
With the hBK, developers can create applications like Bitcoin (re)staking, Bitcoin-enabled lending markets, and democratized Bitcoin Miner Extractable Value (MEV) marketplaces.
Also, PoP’s modular nature enables Hemi to extend this security efficiently to other blockchains. Hemi summarised: 

It enables developers to build trustless dApps that combine Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum’s programmability. This opens up new possibilities for complex decentralized applications.

How Hemi’s Novel PoP Consensus Protocol Works
Hemi Labs’ consensus mechanism, Proof-of-Proof (PoP), is a novel approach that emerged from field tests by Veriblock before Hemi Labs acquired the company in 2023.
The PoP protocol allows Hemi to  “inherit Bitcoin’s robust security while maintaining Ethereum’s flexibility,” something proposed to use “and exceed” Bitcoin’s security.
The PoP consensus mechanism predates BitVM but enables what Garzik calls “superfinality,” securing transactions with minimal delay, achieving full finality within 2 hours or 12 Bitcoin blocks, notably quicker than other optimistic fraud-proof systems.
Hemi miners play a crucial role by publishing network data to the Bitcoin blockchain. Once Bitcoin confirms this data, it inherits the same security level as Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism, ensuring that Bitcoin’s established security protects Hemi’s transactions.
A key component of Hemi’s infrastructure is the Hemi Virtual Machine (hVM), which is a full Bitcoin node integrated within an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). 
The hVM tracks Bitcoin’s state in real time, eliminating the need for third-party data relayers and reducing associated risks. This direct connection enhances the security and reliability of Hemi’s operations.
By tackling key security challenges and offering a unique blend of Bitcoin’s security and Ethereum’s flexibility, Hemi aims to establish a more robust and trustworthy decentralized infrastructure.

Bitcoin (BTC) saw choppy, albeit bullish, price action on Wednesday after the Fed cut rates in the US by 50bps to 4.75-5.0% and signaled more interest rate easing than the market had anticipated in 2025 in its updated dot-plot.

The price of Bitcoin swung between $60,000 and $61,000 after the Fed rate cut announcement.

Going into this week’s meeting, Wall Street had been split over whether the Fed would cut interest rates for the first time since 2020 by 25 or 50bps. 
So, the decision to opt for a larger 50bps cut to the target range of the federal funds rate would have surprised some market participants.
But that wasn’t the only dovish aspect of the policy announcement. 
The Fed’s graphic showing the interest rate forecasts of its members called the dot-plot, showed that the median Fed policymaker expects a further 150bps in rate cuts by the end of 2025.

Fed cuts rates by 50bps and signals more cuts to come.

New economic projections were also released. The Fed expects inflation to continue falling towards 2.0% and for the unemployment rate to stabilize around its current level between now and 2026.
In his post-policy announcement press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the Fed’s view that the US economy would remain robust.

Fed Rate Cut Fuelled Rally in Crypto Incoming? 
The ingredients for a Fed-fueled rally in crypto markets appear to be falling into place.
The Fed looks intent on aggressively lowering interest rates but remains upbeat on the economy.
That’s potentially a “goldilocks” scenario for risk assets, and major US equities could vault to fresh record highs as a result.
Meanwhile, the US dollar and US yields should probably continue to subside. This is a potentially very bullish macro backdrop for Bitcoin.
As long as US recession fears don’t suddenly surge back, the stage could be set for BTC heading back towards $70,000 in the coming weeks. 

Of course, US election uncertainty remains high. Polymarket has Democrat Presidential nominee Kamala Harris as the slight favorite. 
While a victory for Republican nominee and former President Trump might be better for the market in the short-term, it likely won’t matter too much in the long run, with Harris potentially open to a softer stance on the crypto industry than the current Biden administration.
Major market rallies usually follow US Presidential elections as uncertainty clears up.
The delayed-bullish impact of the BTC halving could also come into play in the final quarter.

Some view them as catalysts for innovation and progress, while others perceive them as disruptive forces that undermine the network's stability and core values.And this dichotomy is precisely what we’ll zero in on today. We’ll look at why these forks happened, what they have achieved, and what they mean for Bitcoin's future.Major Bitcoin Forks and Their ImpactEven though the nascent Bitcoin community was anything but cohesive, people were still somewhat successful in implementing Satoshi’s vision. However, the first crack appeared with the creation of Bitcoin XT in 2014, which fractured the community but provided a valuable lesson in governance. This crypto schism occurred due to the devs’ wishes to increase the block size from one to eight megabytes, but others thought this was going too far. Thus, Bitcoin Classic (now shut down), with 2MB block sizes, was born, followed by Bitcoin Unlimited going in a completely opposite direction with gargantuan 16MB blocks. However, this was followed by truly impactful forks, ones whose impact is felt even today. This includes: Bitcoin Cash (BCH)Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was created on August 1, 2017, as a result of a hard fork from Bitcoin. The primary motivation behind this fork was to address Bitcoin’s scalability issues, particularly the slow transaction times and high fees that resulted from Bitcoin's 1MB block size limit. Proponents of Bitcoin Cash, including influential figures like Roger Ver, argued that increasing the block size would allow for more transactions per block, thus reducing fees and speeding up transaction times.Upon its creation, Bitcoin Cash quickly gained attention and was adopted by several exchanges and merchants. It also saw an initial surge in value, reaching a significant market capitalization. Over time, Bitcoin Cash has continued to evolve, with ongoing development and updates aimed at improving its functionality and scalability. It has maintained a dedicated community of supporters who believe in its potential as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. However, it faces competition from other cryptocurrencies that also aim to offer low fees and fast transaction times. Today, the debate over scalability and transaction fees continues to influence Bitcoin Cash's direction and development. Bitcoin SV (BSV)Bitcoin SV (Satoshi Vision) emerged on November 15, 2018, following a contentious split from Bitcoin Cash. The fork was driven by disagreements within the Bitcoin Cash community, particularly regarding further block size increases and the direction of development. The project was spearheaded by Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre, who aimed to restore what they viewed as Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision of Bitcoin.Bitcoin SV significantly increased the block size limit, initially to 128MB and then to 2GB, allowing for a much higher volume of transactions. The proponents of BSV argue that this large block size is necessary for the network to support enterprise-level applications and massive transaction volumes.Likewise, this significant increase in block size has also led to concerns about centralization, as running a full node becomes more resource-intensive.Bitcoin SV remains a controversial fork within the broader Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community. Its focus on large block sizes and high transaction throughput positions it uniquely among major cryptocurrencies. However, it still faces ongoing challenges in achieving widespread acceptance, with Coinbase finally dumping it for good in 2023.Bitcoin Gold (BTG)Bitcoin Gold was created on October 24, 2017, with the aim of making Bitcoin mining more decentralized. It achieved this by altering the mining algorithm from Bitcoin's SHA-256 to Equihash, which is more resistant to ASIC mining. This change was intended to allow more people to mine BTG using regular GPUs, reducing the dominance of large mining farms and truly democratizing the token.Bitcoin Gold uses the Equihash algorithm, which is designed to be memory-intensive and resistant to ASIC mining hardware. This divergence aims to democratize mining by making it more accessible to individuals.Bitcoin Gold saw initial enthusiasm and was adopted by several exchanges. However, it has faced security challenges, including a major 51% attack in 2018 that resulted in $70,000 worth of double spend.Today, Bitcoin Gold continues to exist as a smaller player in the cryptocurrency market. Its focus on decentralizing mining remains its primary distinguishing feature, though it has struggled to gain the same level of adoption and market presence as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV.The Motivations Behind Bitcoin ForksBitcoin forks occur for various reasons, driven by a mix of ideological, technical, and economic motivations. For example, one of the primary drivers for Bitcoin forks has been the need to address scalability issues. As Bitcoin's popularity grew, the network faced challenges in handling an increasing number of transactions, leading to longer confirmation times and higher fees. Forks have also been initiated to introduce technical improvements or new features to the Bitcoin protocol. These could include changes to the consensus mechanism, enhanced privacy features, or the introduction of smart contract capabilitiesIn some cases, personal motivations, such as power struggles, ideological differences, or financial incentives, have contributed to the creation of Bitcoin forks. If you pay attention to the historical volatility of forks such as Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Cash, you will notice that some people viewed them as investment vehicles.For example, Bitcoin Cash, which split from Bitcoin in August 2017, saw its price surge to around $4,355 in December 2017, shortly after its inception. However, it later stabilized and traded within a range of $200 to $500 over the following years.How These Major Forks Have Impacted Bitcoin Aside from the obvious impact, the increase in threats to the OG BTC, major forks have had both a tangible and intangible effect on the crypto community as a whole. Truth be told, none of these forks have emerged as legitimate solutions to cash flow problems, but their impact is nonetheless Market VolatilityBitcoin forks often lead to heightened market volatility. For instance, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fork in August 2017 caused notable price fluctuations in both Bitcoin and the newly created Bitcoin Cash. Before the fork, Bitcoin's price was around $2,800, but it dropped to $2,700 immediately after the fork. Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, started trading at approximately $555​.Similarly, Bitcoin SV (BSV), which split from Bitcoin Cash in 2018, has seen its price swing dramatically. In January 2020, BSV peaked at around $441.20, but by June 2024, its price had dropped to around $63​. These fluctuations are often driven by investor speculation and market manipulation, with some viewing these forks as opportunities for financial gains.Network Scalability and DevelopmentForks have also spurred significant debates and developments regarding Bitcoin's scalability. The original Bitcoin network has limitations, such as a one-megabyte block size and ten-minute block creation time, which constrain its transaction throughput. As mentioned previously, these limitations led to the creation of Bitcoin Cash, which increased the block size to 8MB to handle more transactions per block​​.The forks highlighted the need for scalability solutions, prompting various projects and protocols to enhance Bitcoin's transaction capacity. One prominent example is the Lightning Network, a layer-two solution designed to facilitate faster and cheaper transactions by creating off-chain payment channelsSecurity ConcernsSome forks have introduced security vulnerabilities. For instance, the lower hash rate and interest in Bitcoin SV have made it more susceptible to 51% attacks, where a malicious actor can control the majority of the network's mining power, compromising its security. This has, unfortunately, led to concerns about the long-term viability and security of certain Bitcoin forks. What’s the point of further forking if organized malicious actors can seize control so easily? ConclusionAs the cryptocurrency market matures and becomes increasingly integrated with traditional financial systems, the impact of Bitcoin forks on the wider economy cannot be understated. The success or failure of these forks will not only affect the fortunes of individual investors and businesses but could also have ramifications for the stability and security of the global financial infrastructure.Ultimately, the future of Bitcoin and its forks will depend on the community's ability to find common ground and work towards a shared vision of a decentralized, inclusive, and resilient financial system.This is a guest post by Kiara Taylor.

The approved options on the iShares Bitcoin Trust will be physically settled, meaning that when the option is exercised, Bitcoin will be delivered to fulfill the contract. These American-style options can be exercised at any time before the expiration date, providing flexibility for traders. According to the SEC, the listing will follow the same rules as options on other exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including position limits and margin requirements.""I'm assuming others will be approved in short order,"" said Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas. ""Huge win for the the bitcoin ETFs (as it will attract more liquidity which will in turn attract more big fish).

Bitcoin Magazine,How Bitcoin Will React After The U.S. Election,"Fri, 20 Sep 2024 16:30:47 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/how-bitcoin-will-react-after-the-u-s-election-,Can Historical Election Trends Predict Bitcoin’s Next Move?,"As the U.S. presidential election approaches, it’s worth examining how past elections have influenced Bitcoin’s price. Historically, the U.S. stock market has shown notable trends around election periods. Given Bitcoin’s correlation with equities and, most notably, the S&P 500, these trends could offer insights into what might happen next.S&P 500 CorrelationBitcoin and the S&P 500 have historically held a strong correlation, particularly during BTC’s bull cycles and periods of a risk-on sentiment throughout traditional markets. This could phenomenon could potentially come to an end as Bitcoin matures and ‘decouples’ from equities and it’s narrative as a speculative asset. However there’s no evidence yet that this is the case.

Figure 1: Bitcoin & The S&P 500 180-day correlation over the past five years. View Live Chart 🔍

Post Election OutperformanceThe S&P 500 has typically reacted positively following U.S. presidential elections. This pattern has been consistent over the past few decades, with the stock market often experiencing significant gains in the year following an election. In the S&P500 vs Bitcoin YoY Change chart we can see when elections occur (orange circles), and the price action of BTC (black line) and the S&P 500 (blue line) in the months that follow.

Figure 2: Bitcoin & The S&P 500 outsized returns in the year post-election. View Live Chart 🔍

2012 Election: In November 2012, the S&P 500 saw 11% year-on-year growth. A year later, this growth surged to around 32%, reflecting a strong post-election market rally.2016 Election: In November 2016, the S&P 500 was up by about 7% year-on-year. A year later, it had increased by approximately 22%, again showing a substantial post-election boost.2020 Election: The pattern continued in 2020. The S&P 500’s growth was around 17-18% in November 2020; by the following year, it had climbed to nearly 29%.A Recent Phenomenon?This isn’t limited to the previous three elections while Bitcoin existed. To get a larger data set, we can look at the previous four decades, or ten elections, of S&P 500 returns. Only one year had negative returns twelve months following election day (2000, as the dot-com bubble burst).

Figure 3: The S&P 500 has performed well following election day a majority of the time.

Historical data suggests that whether Republican or Democrat, the winning party doesn't significantly impact these positive market trends. Instead, the upward momentum is more about resolving uncertainty and boosting investor confidence.How Will Bitcoin React This TimeAs we approach the 2024 U.S. presidential election, it's tempting to speculate on Bitcoin's potential performance. If historical trends hold, we could see significant price increases. For example:If we experience the same percentage gains in the 365 days following the election as we did in 2012, Bitcoin's price could rise to $1,000,000 or more. If we experience the same as the 2016 election, we could climb to around $500,000, and something similar to 2020 could see a $250,000 BTC.It's interesting to note that each occurrence has resulted in returns decreasing by about 50% each time, so maybe $125,000 is a realistic target for November 2025, especially as that price and data align with the middle bands of the Rainbow Price Chart. It’s also worth noting that in all of those cycles, Bitcoin actually went on to experience even higher cycle peak gains!

ConclusionThe data suggests that the period after a U.S. presidential election is generally bullish for both the stock market and Bitcoin. With less than two months until the next election, Bitcoin investors may have reason to be optimistic about the months ahead.For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out a recent YouTube video here: Will The U.S. Election Be Bullish For Bitcoin?"

BTC is up nearly 6% since the Fed cut the US interest rate by 50 basis points. Yet, the report highlighted that Bitcoin’s current rally is driven primarily by futures trading rather than spot market activity, which raises concerns about potential volatility and correction.
Derivatives-fueled rally
Global open interest (OI) in Bitcoin futures has reached $19.43 billion, surpassing the Aug. 25 value of $18.93 billion, while the price remains about $1,000 below the local high. This suggests that the current price movement is led by perpetuals and futures trading, contrasting with the spot market-dominated rally earlier this month.
Additionally, the spot market buying has slowed as the spot cumulative delta indicator flattened above $63,500. This development, coupled with increased futures activity, suggests the potential for a new lower timeframe range or partial correction.
Although this can be seen as a bearish sign, Bitfinex analysts pointed out that OI does not indicate how much leverage derivatives traders are using. The high OI is likely driven by investors’ renewed interest in speculating on risk assets such as Bitcoin after the rate cut.
Furthermore, altcoin speculation is also on the rise, with some tokens like SUI and AAVE seeing 100% gains since their August and September lows. However, altcoin open interest has also hit a higher high of $11.48 billion compared to the Aug. 19 peak of $10.74 billion.
ETF flows suggest otherwise
A counter-argument to potential consolidation is the renewed interest in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which saw $397.2 million in net inflows last week after a period of outflows from Aug. 24 to Sept. 6.
The crypto market’s future direction may be influenced by broader market trends, particularly if the S&P 500 continues to rally beyond all-time highs and Bitcoin follows suit.
The report highlighted that risk appetite for Bitcoin from traditional finance has manifested itself through spot ETF inflows, historically contributing to a strong correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500.

According to CryptoQuant data, the country’s significant presence in Bitcoin mining persists, but its dominance is now being challenged as other countries, such as the US, increase their share of hashrate.
CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju noted that US mining pools account for approximately 40% of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate. This share predominantly represents institutional miners, who leverage advanced technology and resources to maintain their competitive edge.
In contrast, Chinese mining pools continue to support smaller players in the region, demonstrating resilience despite ongoing legal restrictions on crypto activities.
China’s strict ban
China’s current stance on crypto is among the strictest globally. The country first took action in 2017, banning Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and shutting down domestic exchanges. This move was followed by its 2021 ban on mining and trading.
The crackdown aimed to curb the financial and environmental risks associated with digital assets. However, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin has allowed miners to find ways around the restrictions, maintaining China’s outsized influence over the global Bitcoin network.
Additionally, underground crypto trading markets continue to thrive in the country via VPNs and social media platforms, with the latest estimates placing the annual volume of crypto transactions in China at roughly $86 billion.
In parallel, the country has explored alternatives like the digital yuan, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) controlled by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC). The digital yuan is part of China’s broader strategy to maintain financial control while limiting the influence of decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
Calls for change
Meanwhile, industry leaders like Tron founder Justin Sun have urged China to rethink its policies on digital assets, particularly as the US positions itself as a global leader in crypto under former President Donald Trump’s pro-Bitcoin agenda. Sun argued that fostering competition between China and the US in crypto policy could drive significant advancements in the industry.
Meanwhile, there are indications that China may be softening its stance on crypto, particularly with its growing interest in blockchain technology and potential regulatory changes.
Recent reports suggest that China could consider revising its strict crypto regulations, especially in light of its actions in Hong Kong, which is positioning itself as a burgeoning crypto hub with implied support from Beijing.
While the official stance remains stringent, these developments point to a possible shift in China’s regulatory approach toward cryptocurrencies in the future. However, concrete changes have yet to be announced.

This influx boosted the total assets under management (AuM) for crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) by 9%, bringing the total to $85.8 billion. The overall investment product volume also increased to approximately $9.5 billion.
James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, linked this positive trend to the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points. He explained:
“This surge was likely driven by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) comments last Wednesday, which took a more dovish stance than anticipated, including a 50 basis point interest rate cut.”
Bitcoin, US dominate flows
A breakdown of the flows showed that Bitcoin-based investment products led the inflows, generating $284 million in net gains globally last week. Notably, major crypto funds from firms like BlackRock, Bitwise, Fidelity, ProShares, and 21Shares contributed to this rebound, collectively adding $321 million in net inflows.
The positive price momentum for Bitcoin also attracted investors with bearish sentiment, who allocated $5.1 million to short-Bitcoin funds.
Ethereum faced its fifth consecutive week of outflows, totaling $29 million. This trend stems from ongoing withdrawals from Grayscale’s ETHE product and declining interest in new offerings.
Crypto Assets Weekly Flow (Source: CoinShares)
According to Farside data, ETHE experienced outflows between $13 million and $18 million for three straight days last week, overshadowing minor inflows from other products, including Grayscale’s Mini-Trust.
Meanwhile, Solana maintained its current positive trend, adding $3.2 million in inflows last week. This flow can also be linked to the announcements of several traditional financial institutions announcing plans to launch financial services on the network during the latest Solana Breakpoint event in Singapore.
Other large-cap altcoins, including XRP and Litecoin, saw combined inflows of $300,000.
Across regions, the US unsurprisingly emerged as the leading contributor to last week’s inflow, accounting for $277 million, followed by Switzerland with $63 million.
In contrast, Germany, Sweden, and Canada experienced outflows of $9.5 million, $7.8 million, and $2.3 million, respectively.

Markus Thielen, Head of Research at 10x Research, expressed a bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price, predicting that the cryptocurrency is “set to smash new all-time highs in Q4 2024.”
In a September 22 10x Research report, Thielen highlighted an exciting phase for the cryptocurrency market from October to March, marking it as a potential inflection point for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

He noted improvements in the market structure, which could establish a solid foundation for a bullish trajectory.
The rising supply of stablecoins indicates heightened liquidity, which can enhance trading activity—often a precursor to significant price rallies.
Meanwhile, Elevated leverage levels in futures trading reflect a more speculative environment among traders, potentially driving prices upward. According to Coinglass data, open interest has surged to levels unseen since early August, topping $17.6 billion.
Additionally, the release of $16 billion from FTX creditors between December 2024 and March 2025 is expected to bring more capital into the market. Thielen estimates that between $5 billion and $8 billion could re-enter the crypto space, further propelling Bitcoin’s ascent.
Past Barriers to Bitcoin’s Price Flip to Catalysts
As we enter Q4, past suppressants to the Bitcoin price are being lifted, contributing to a more favorable environment ripe for potential growth
One of the main catalysts for Bitcoin’s recent rally is the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points. This move has shifted toward “risk-on” assets as investors seek opportunities amid a weakened U.S. dollar, rising inflation, and ongoing fiscal uncertainty.
The stability of BTC miners post-halving has also contributed to the positive sentiment. Bitcoin halving events, which reduce the block reward for miners, often lead to a period of instability in the mining sector. 
According to Blockchain.com data, following the April 2024 halving, the network’s hash rate has returned to pre-halving levels, signaling that the market has absorbed the impact.
Additionally, major Bitcoin sell-offs appear to be over, providing a clear runway for further price appreciation. The German government and the Mt. Gox trustees have completed their sales, with $11 billion worth of Bitcoin priced in without any significant price disruptions.
Kamala Harris Promises to Support Crypto
Political developments have significantly bolstered sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with the upcoming US election emerging as a major catalyst for optimism. 
Vice President Kamala Harris’s first public endorsement of digital assets has heightened this bullish outlook. Speaking at a Sunday fundraiser at Cipriani Wall Street in Manhattan, she affirmed a commitment to supporting crypto and AI to foster innovation.

We will partner together to invest in America’s competitiveness, to invest in America’s future. We will encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets, while protecting our consumers and investors.

This endorsement, along with Donald Trump’s open support for cryptocurrency, highlights a growing bipartisan backing that is expected to drive significant momentum in the cryptocurrency space as the push for regulatory clarity intensifies.

Bitcoin will not become more widely adopted as a result of intellectual curiosity or because it’s theoretically the best form of money ever. Instead, people will begin to use it because it solves pressing problems in their lives. So, if you’re looking to foster greater Bitcoin adoption, show someone how they can use Bitcoin to solve an issue their facing.Hermann Vivier, co-founder of Bitcoin Ekasi, a Bitcoin circular economy in South Africa was given this advice from Mike Peterson, Director of Bitcoin Beach, the world’s first Bitcoin circular economy, and it continues to inform his work.The broader problem that Bitcoin solves for underserved South Africans is that it provides them with a means to save in an environment in which many don’t trust banks or have much access to other investments. Part of the reason they don’t trust banks is because they’re often charged hidden fees from both the banks themselves as well as local merchants.Vivier told Bitcoin Magazine that many in the community often purchase goods via layaway programs (buy now, pay later) and are often duped by stipulations in the fine print of the deals.“You can go in and buy something today, not pay for it at all, take it home and then the merchant starts charging you after the second or the third month,” explained Vivier.“These credit schemes are quite exploitative. The fees would go up over time as interest accumulates and the residents give the company the right to just draw the money from their bank accounts, but the buyers don't understand what they're signing away,” he added. “After a year, they see there's still money going out of their account, but in their mind, they've already finished paying for this thing, yet they're still paying for it and they don't know why.”Vivier went on to explain that the simple fact that money cannot be automatically withdrawn from a Bitcoin wallet like it can from a bank account provides Bitcoin Ekasi community members with more of a sense of control over their funds.Rich Swisher, founder of Motiv, an NGO that develops Bitcoin circular economies and helps members of unbanked communities in Perú become more financially independent, also uses Bitcoin to help the financially disadvantaged have more control over their money.Swisher told Bitcoin Magazine that residents of the communities with whom Motiv works can’t save cash in their homes because of the high likelihood that they’ll be robbed. And many don't use banks because they charge fees that these residents can't afford to pay (That's if banking services are available at all.) Bitcoin provides them with a way to bank themselves, which serves as a financial base for them to start their own enterprises.“With Bitcoin, they can start a small business that they can run out of their home and run off of their phone,” Swisher told Bitcoin Magazine.“Over time they see that they can be financially independent. Then, they start seeing that not only do I have a good path going right now, but if it was all taken away from me tomorrow, I have the know-how to redo it,” he added.“None of this happens without Bitcoin.”So, does that mean you have to run out and start a full-on Bitcoin circular economy in an underserved community if you want to see more Bitcoin adoption? Absolutely not.But how hard would it be to show your friend who runs a non-profit how to accept bitcoin for international donations so to save on wire transfer fees or to show a family member how to send an international remittance using Bitcoin instead of Western Union, which charges high fees for its service? Not that hard.If you want to see more people using Bitcoin, quit the habit of explaining to those around you how great it is, and start showing them what problems it solves.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,The Positive End To 2024 For Bitcoin,"Fri, 04 Oct 2024 15:37:05 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-positive-end-to-2024-for-bitcoin-,Optimism Ahead: Will Q4 2024 Deliver Bitcoin's Next Big Rally?,"As 2024 comes to a close, Bitcoin investors are eagerly eyeing the final quarter of the year, traditionally known for positive price action. With many speculating that a bullish rally may be on the horizon, let’s break down the historical data, analyze trends, and weigh the possibilities of what BTC’s price action might look like by the end of this year.Historical Performance of Bitcoin in Q4Looking at the past decade on the Monthly Returns Heatmap, Q4 has frequently delivered impressive gains for Bitcoin. Data shows that BTC often finishes the year strong, as evidenced by three consecutive green months in 2023. Not every year follows this trend however, 2021 and 2022 were less favorable, with Bitcoin ending the year on a more bearish note. Yet, years like 2020 and 2015 through to 2017 saw tremendous price surges, highlighting the potential for a bullish finish in Q4.

Figure 1: Q4 Performance has been historically strong for Bitcoin. View Live Chart 🔍

Analyzing Potential Q4 2024 Outcomes Based on Historical DataTo better understand potential outcomes for Q4 2024, we can compare previous Q4 performances with the current price action. This can give us an idea of how Bitcoin might behave if historical patterns continue. The range of potential outcomes is broad, from significant gains to minor losses, or even sideways price movement. The projection lines are rainbow color coded going from 2023 in red back to 2015 in a light violet shade.

Figure 2: Previous Q4 price action overlaid to today.

For example, in 2017 (purple line), Bitcoin experienced a significant increase, suggesting that in an optimistic scenario, Bitcoin could reach prices as high as $240,000 by the end of 2024.However, more conservative estimates are also possible. In a more moderate Q4, Bitcoin could range between $93,000 and $110,000, while in a bearish scenario, prices could drop as low as $34,000, as seen in 2018 (blue line).The median outcome based on this data seems to be around the $85,000 price point. Although this is based on the year end price from these projections, years such as 2021 (yellow line) resulted in considerably higher price before notable pullbacks to end the year.Is The Median Outcome A Possibility?Whilst an $85,000 in around three months time may seem optimistic, we only have to look back to February of this year to see a single month in which BTC experienced a 43.63% increase. We can also look to metrics such as The Golden Ratio Multiplier which are showing confluence around this level as a potential target with its 1.6x Accumulation High level.

Figure 3: Golden Ratio Multiplier 1.6x Accumulation High currently at ~$85,000. View Live Chart 🔍

Is $240,000 Even Possible?Whether Bitcoin can achieve such high values will depend on various factors. An increase in demand coupled with limited supply could propel Bitcoin to new all-time highs. Furthermore, developments such as Bitcoin ETFs, institutional investments, or major geopolitical events could further boost demand. We’re also seeing a similar pattern in this cycle as we have seen in the previous two, with a first wave of large scale market inflows before a cool-off period; potentially setting up a second rally in the near future.

Figure 4: Cycle Capital Flows showing a similar run-up and cool-off period to prior cycles. View Live Chart 🔍

This is probably over-ambitious, Bitcoin’s market cap has grown tremendously since 2017 and we’d require tens of billions of money pouring into the market. But Bitcoin is Bitcoin, and nothing is out of the question in this space!ConclusionUltimately, while historical data suggests optimism for Q4, predicting Bitcoin’s future is always speculative. A third of all of these projections resulted in sideways price action, with one forecasting a large scale decline. As always, it’s important for investors to remain unbiased and react to, rather than predict Bitcoin data and price action.For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out our recent YouTube video here:Bitcoin Q4 - A Positive End To 2024?"
Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine Introduces New Short Form Opinion Format: Takes,"Fri, 04 Oct 2024 15:20:11 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/bitcoin-magazine-introduces-opinion-takes,The oldest and most trusted Bitcoin publication is introducing a new short-form content format.,"Every author has their own voice.At Bitcoin Magazine, we've long been advocates of elevating the voices from the Bitcoin community. As the premier publisher of Bitcoin opinion content, we continually amplify the various perspectives from across the industry, whether they're those of major CEOs or humble stackers.That said, the Bitcoin Magazine brand has often relied on a more unified (or classical) editorial voice in its publication. We're now taking steps to change that, by introducing a new article type called “Takes”.Takes are short articles about an idea, trend, blog post, person, company, product or proposal in the Bitcoin space, on which the authors give their (indeed) ""takes."" Compared to featured stories, Takes are more quickly written and opinionated. This means that Takes will offer a window into the thoughts and ideas of our authors, allowing readers to get an unfiltered glimpse of how they view Bitcoin and the world around it.Takes are published by the Bitcoin Magazine editorial team, but can also be written by anyone else who works at Bitcoin Magazine or its parent company BTC Inc. Occasionally outside contributors may contribute Takes as well.Of course, Bitcoin Magazine will continue to publish long-form features and contributed opinion pieces alongside Takes. Takes will continue to abide by our established policies for Layer 2 networks, as well as Bitcoin tokens, and be clearly labelled for reader understanding.We hope our Takes model will add to the discourse, and spur conversation as Bitcoin continues to advance and become widely used as the ultimate form of money."
Bitcoin Magazine,"No, You Won't Find Out Who Satoshi Nakamoto Is Next Week","Fri, 04 Oct 2024 14:46:41 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/no-you-wont-find-out-who-satoshi-nakamoto-is-next-week,"As a longtime Bitcoiner, I'm certain this latest Satoshi Nakamoto unmasking attempt will disappoint just like the rest — with no real proof provided!","





As a longtime Bitcoiner, I had to roll my eyes when I saw HBO release a trailer for an upcoming documentary, teasing to reveal Satoshi's identity. Speculation arose that it would reveal who is Satoshi Nakamoto. After seeing many half-baked attempts to ""unmask"" Satoshi over the years, I'm certain this latest one won't provide definitive proof either.If you've been in Bitcoin long enough, you know the drill — someone claims they know or are Satoshi, theories start swirling, but no convincing evidence ever materializes. Inevitably it ends with embarrassment for the accuser. We've been through this rodeo too many times now.With Bitcoin becoming a $1.2 trillion asset class, the allure of outing Satoshi is understandable. His stash alone is supposedly 1.1 million BTC, worth over $65 billion currently. The usual suspects like Adam Back, Hal Finney or Nick Szabo will likely be resurrected as prime candidates. And the accused will again firmly deny the allegations. Our favorite Bitcoin historian, Pete Rizzo, already made $200 bets with Shinobi, Nikolaus, Frank, and I that Back ends up named and denies it.Yet ideally, Satoshi should remain anonymous as he clearly desired. Bitcoin succeeds on the merits of its decentralized design, not based on any single personality. Unmasking Satoshi risks undermining Bitcoin's mystique and independence.As Bitcoin grows into a global asset, the stakes around identifying its creator rise exponentially. The richest person on earth makes for an attractive bounty. But true proof remains elusive.These periodic media frenzies claiming to crack the case produce great hype yet always disappoint. They act as amateur sleuths following flawed hunches rather than impartial investigations seeking truth.So I advise fellow Bitcoiners to take next week's ""big reveal"" with a huge grain of salt. It will likely be more sensationalism than substance, repeating familiar theories that fall short of definitive evidence. The only person who can conclusively prove they are Satoshi is Satoshi himself. Until then, the mystery continues - as it should.This article is a Take. Opinions expressed are entirely the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine."

Follow Aaron on Nostr or X.

In his take from this Monday, Nikolaus argued that Donald Trump is heavily pro-Bitcoin. I beg to differ.Yes, Trump is providing lip service to Bitcoiners, which is more than we can say of Kamala Harris. The fact that he spoke at the Bitcoin conference is certainly interesting, and at least indicates that he’s aware of the “crypto voter” as a potential voting block. And yes, Trump did show up at PubKey, which was a fun little stunt— though he apparently wasn’t even able to make the payment himself.But it’s blatantly obvious he just wants your money and your vote. Of course, the same can be said for most politicians, but if anything, Trump is a more extreme example of this. He’ll basically scam you for it if he must, whether it’s through these ridiculous NFTs, or with whatever his new shitcoin project is supposed to be.I'm not at all convinced that Trump will continue to be an ally of Bitcoin if he does get elected for a second term. Even at Bitcoin 2024, his closing remarks —“have fun with your crypto, and Bitcoin, and all the other things you play with”— made clear he doesn’t actually care about Bitcoin in any real way. Indeed, just a few years ago, Trump said he was “not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air”.Right now, Trump needs your money and your vote— but he won’t need that anymore after he is elected. Even if you want to take seriously his blabberings like “miners get all the electricity they need for mining”, is there any reason to believe he won’t throw Bitcoin under the bus the moment that benefits him... most obviously, in favor of the dollar?Given Trump’s track record of broken campaign promises in his first term, I wouldn’t expect anything else.This article is a Take.

Follow Frank on X.

Last night, I had the distinct pleasure of having an in-depth conversation with Jeff Booth, who I often refer to as the Eckhart Tolle of Bitcoin.Booth, soft-spoken yet direct, harped on one point in particular in the conversation that, while at first I didn’t grasp, ended up resonating deeply with me.He said multiple times “We are Bitcoin” in efforts to drive home the point that Bitcoin will continue to work if we continue to make it work.At first this statement seemed antithetical to Bitcoin. Technically, of course, we’re not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an open-source protocol that allows people to transfer value securely and permissionlessly. Also, Bitcoin was designed in a way that actually requires less human involvement than the traditional monetary and financial systems, as its inflation rate can’t be altered by humans and there are no middle people involved in Bitcoin transactions.Yet we are Bitcoin, just as Booth said.We are the ones that have to spin up nodes to keep the network decentralized.We are the ones that plug in the miners to help power and secure the network.And we are the ones who educate others about Bitcoin as well as defend it in the social arena.We’re human nodes in the network, doing our part to technically keep Bitcoin running and propagating information about Bitcoin to the world.Without our taking responsibility as human nodes, Bitcoin becomes less decentralized, less secure and less understood.So, if you’re reading this, know that you are Bitcoin, a component of the most incredible system for human freedom and prosperity ever created, and both savor that and act accordingly.This article is a Take.

Nothing stops this train. 


No, I’m not talking about the Federal Reserve money printer, I’m talking about the string of ETF announcements from Wall Street and the related crypto firms servicing it this week.I’m talking about today’s hybrid Ethereum-Bitcoin ETF, yesterday’s XRP ETF, and what will likely be 2025’s basket memecoin ETF offering exposure to everything from PEPE to GIGA to HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu. If you’re takeaway from the arguably dismal ETH ETF launch is that there won’t be more crypto ETFs, I’m sorry but you’re looking past the $1 trillion price tag on the rest of the crypto industry.Wall Street wants to sell products that make U.S. dollars, and they will continue to do things that make dollars. OK, in a bear market, maybe that’s not an Ethereum ETF. But it’s hard to imagine that in a world where the U.S. regulatory environment continues to become “more advantageous to the industry,” and there aren’t 15 to 20 of these ETFs all pumping in a bull market. Maybe you’ve forgotten how in 2017 XRP pumped to $4 or DASH to $700, how in 2021, JPEGs sold for hundreds of millions. Newsflash: 80% of ETF purchasers are retail buyers, and that’s according to Blackrock.Maybe you think all our proselytizing to the likes of Rick Rubin has seeped somehow into the collective consciousness. Maybe you’re betting on Kamala Harris getting elected, and that she will continue to let Gary Gensler and the SEC run roughshod over crypto. Fair enough. That’s not a world I see. The Bitcoin-crypto voter constituency is here, and whether it delivers the election to Donald Trump, or it wins concessions from the Harris administration, that means more ETFs, not less. Certainly not a world where there’s only a Bitcoin ETF anytime soon.Again, Wall Street is not embracing the tao of Michael Saylor, they don’t see President Nayib Bukele as a developing world savant. They do not believe Bitcoin is a bulwark against money printing, and no it doesn’t matter that they are writing research reports to the effect. They will say whatever they can to sell ETFs, to make USD.Because they are not convicted buyers. They are convicted sellers. There’s a difference. This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,VIVEK: Bitcoin Lightning Payments Has a Long Way To Go In India,"Thu, 03 Oct 2024 12:50:17 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/vivek-bitcoin-lightning-payments-has-a-long-way-to-go-in-india,I couldn't resist the lightning fast fiat payments network in India… ,"





As an Indian Bitcoiner returning home recently, I found myself using UPI digital payments repeatedly for everyday spending. UPI (Unified Payments Interface) is India's real-time bank-to-bank payment system that has become ubiquitous for making payments by scanning QR codes or using phone numbers. It's enabled even street vendors and tiny shops to accept payments online. Given the difficulty of getting cash change and vendors needing to keep the card machines, UPI is often the only payment option. And I have to admit; it's incredibly fast, cheap, and easy to pay merchants through UPI apps compared to fumbling with Bitcoin Lightning wallets, custodial or non-custodial. The money moves instantly for free, and the process is familiar to all parties.


While I'm huge on censorship-resistant, private, and decentralized money, Bitcoin and UPI's convenience are hard to ignore. UPI processes over 14 billion monthly transactions across over 450 banks with no fees. By comparison, Lightning is dealing with low liquidity, channel balancing headaches, and clunky user experiences (which keep improving with custodial wallets with some tradeoffs). Of course, the privacy implications of an almost fully digital system controlled by centralized third parties make me cringe and sound dystopian. But most Indians happily surrender privacy for convenience time and again.So, even as a Bitcoiner, I can't see most Indians ditching UPI to start using Bitcoin lightning en masse for day-to-day payments anytime soon, apart from Bitcoin circular economies. The incentive needs to be there.

Bitcoin Magazine,OFF-CHAIN PROTOCOLS WILL ALWAYS BE A BALANCING ACT,"Wed, 02 Oct 2024 18:04:05 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/shinobi-off-chain-protocols-will-always-be-a-balancing-act,Important things to consider when looking at the future of off-chain systems. ,"





Rene Pickhardt recently kicked off a thread discussing the differences between two party and multiparty (more than two participants) payment channels as it relates to his research work around payment reliability on the Lightning Network. He voices a growing skepticism of the viability of that direction for development. The high level idea of why channel factories improve the reliability of payments comes down to liquidity allocation. In a network of only two party channels, users have to make zero sum choices on where to allocate their liquidity. This has a systemic effect on the overall success rate of payments across the network, if people put their liquidity somewhere it isn’t needed to process payments instead of where it is, payments will fail as the liquidity in places people need is used up (until it is rebalanced). This dynamic is simply one of the design constraints of the Lightning Network known from the very beginning, and why research like Rene’s is incredibly important for making the protocol/network work in the long run. In a model of multiparty channels, users can allocate liquidity into large groups and simply “sub-allocate” it off-chain wherever it makes sense to in the moment. This means that even if a node operator has made a poor decision in which person to allocate liquidity to, as long as that person is in the same multiparty channel with people that would be a good peer, they can reallocate that poorly placed liquidity from one to the other off-chain without incurring on-chain costs. This works because the concept of a multiparty channel is essentially just everyone in the group stacking conventional two party channels on top of the multiparty one. By updating the multiparty channel at the root, the two party channels on top can be modified, opened, closed, etc. while staying off-chain. The problem Rene is raising is the cost of going on-chain when people don’t cooperate.The entire logic of Lightning is based around the idea that if your single channel counterparty stops cooperating or responding, you can simply submit transactions on chain to enforce control over your funds. When you have a multiparty channel, each “level” in the stack of channels adds more transactions that need to be submitted to the blockchain in order to enforce the current state, meaning that in a high fee environment multiparty channels will be more expensive than two party channels to enforce on-chain. These are core trade-offs to consider when looking at these systems compared to each other, but I think focusing exclusively on the on-chain footprint ignores the more important point regarding off-chain systems: they are all about incentivizing participants to not go on-chain. Properly structuring a multiparty channel, i.e. how you organize the channels stacked on top, can allow you to pack groups of people into subsections that have a reputation for high reliability, or who trust each other. This would allow people in these subgroups to still reorganize liquidity within that subgroup even if people outside of it are not responsive temporarily, or go offline due to technical issues. The on-chain cost of enforcing things, while important, is kind of tangential to the core design goal of an off-chain system: giving people a reason to stay off-chain and cooperate, and removing reasons for people to not cooperate and force things onc-chain. It’s important to not lose sight of that core design aspect of these systems when considering what their future will look like. This article is a Take.

WHERE WE'RE SHOPPING: SLNTIf you’re like me (and you’ve been stacking Bitcoin relentlessly), you’ve probably looked for ways to improve your privacy. 


I’ll admit, it’s a bit of a battle for me. As someone who had a public presence from writing their first article in Bitcoin back in 2013, I don’t have much of a choice – a lot of my personal information is out there, probably forever.That said, little improvements go a long way (or so they say). At least, they make me feel better about the fact that I’m guarding basically all my wealth with no one to hold accountable but myself these days… Anyway, one practical upgrade that I’ve made is to store my Bitcoin hardware devices and seed material in faraday bags, which repulse radiation and block frequencies. I’m not an expert, but I’ve been told this makes the devices harder to tamper with, and as far as additional steps, all you have to do is buy a specific storage bag.I got my first faraday bags for free with my Casa service (a multi-sig Bitcoin security provider that assists me with my self-custody). (They give out free faraday bags from this cool producer called SLNT for people who sign up, but I’ve bought a few more since then along the way.)That’s what turned me on to this privacy masterpiece. I’ve been in need of a new backpack, and I have to admit, despite the $1,000 price tag, the SLNT Submersible Faraday Backpack has my attention.SLNT Faraday Backpack (0:05) Not only does it look pretty sleek, but apparently it can keep your laptop (and any other devices) safe in up to 100 feet of water.As someone with a constant phobia of plane crashes, it’s tempting. Is this more than I need to protect my hardware devices in transit? Do I need to care about solar flares and EMF radiation? Maybe not, but given we may be on the cusp of World War III, that’s another reason to skip a stack and buy this right? I mean, it’s the kind of thing I should own as a “bitcoin expert?”I’ve asked Shinobi if he can make one out of Saran wrap, but alas, this is apparently beyond even his security acumen. Until then, I guess I’m stuck with this on my wishlist. Because there has to be a reason for me not to buy this right? This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,"Vivek: Unsurprisingly, The Bitcoin Price Follows Global Liquidity","Wed, 02 Oct 2024 13:14:50 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/vivek-unsurprisingly-the-bitcoin-price-follows-global-liquidity,Bitcoin's sirens are ringing loudly that a liquidity-driven boom may soon be underway. ,"


What We're Reading: Bitcoin: A Global Liquidity Barometer


I have been intrigued by the significant increase in global liquidity during 2024, driven by extensive money printing and debt expansion, and how it impacts Bitcoin's price. Bitcoin is an expression against the government's monetary expansionist policies, so its price follows global liquidity, as seen here on this chart.It was fascinating to read the recent report by Lyn Alden and Sam Callahan analyzing Bitcoin's correlation to global liquidity. This further reconfirmed my view that more monetary expansion drives more people to Bitcoin, increasing prices. Their rigorous analysis found that over 12-month periods, Bitcoin's price moves in the same direction as global liquidity a remarkable 83% of the time. This is higher than any other major asset class, making Bitcoin a uniquely pure barometer for global liquidity trends.


The report quantified Bitcoin's correlation with global M2 money supply, finding a very strong 0.94 overall correlation between May 2013 and July 2024. Bitcoin's average 12-month rolling correlation was 0.51, while stocks and gold showed moderately high correlations as well in the 0.4 to 0.7 range.Of course, Bitcoin's correlation isn't perfect. Shorter-term breakdowns can occur around crypto-specific events like exchange hacks or Ponzi schemes collapsing.Supply-demand imbalances also cause temporary decoupling when Bitcoin reaches extreme overvaluation levels during market cycle peaks. Yet despite these breakdowns, the long-term relationship persists. Right now, liquidity is soaring to unprecedented levels, suggesting Bitcoin could soon embark on a massive bull run if this relationship holds. While I believe no model perfectly captures Bitcoin's complexity, recognizing its role as a monetary canary in the coal mine can lend valuable insight. If history rhymes, Bitcoin's sirens are ringing loudly that a liquidity-driven boom will soon be underway. This article is a Take.

For the past few weeks I have been keeping up with HODL15Capital on X, who has done a tremendous job at posting some of the quickest incoming market data regarding the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. Recently, there have been two charts in particular he has posted that have caught my eye.Nine months ago, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs for trading, and since then, the ETFs have seen huge inflows during eight out of those nine months. Since their inception, these ETFs have seen inflows of 312,488 BTC while miners have only created 169,942 new bitcoin.Number of Bitcoin purchased by 🇺🇸 #Bitcoin ETFs each month👇$IBIT $FBTC $GBTC $ARKB $BITB $HODL $BRRR $EZBC $BTCW pic.twitter.com/mpeurOCUcR— HODL15Capital 🇺🇸 (@HODL15Capital) October 1, 2024

These ETFs have been the fastest growing ETFs in history, like BlackRock CEO Larry Fink stated, with no real signs of slowing down, especially as we head into a period of time that has been historically bullish for Bitcoin. These ETFs are gobbling up all the available BTC leaving many thinking: Who could possibly be selling right now? And according to HODL15Capital, it appears to be smaller BTC holders, selling directly into the hands of the ETFs and institutions.🚨  Small Bitcoin holders continue to sell to ETFs and $MSTR 🤷‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/hV42fDVlps— HODL15Capital 🇺🇸 (@HODL15Capital) September 26, 2024

We're seeing state pension funds, large institutions, wealthy investors and other major players buy and hold shares of these ETFs. Even ETF issuers like BlackRock are buying shares of its own Bitcoin ETF for their other funds. Long story short, I'm seeing smart money pouring into this asset class and, while that is great for the price of BTC, it pains me to watch smaller holders sell their bitcoin directly to the institutions.Holding Bitcoin over the long term has been proven to be one of the best ways to build wealth. This is a real chance for those interested in investing for their future, who may not currently have proper savings, to start building up wealth in a sovereign way by accumulating BTC and holding the keys to their coins. Instead, these coins are being mostly ""locked up"" in these ETFs, where those who buy them can only redeem their shares for US dollars and don't experience the benefits of the attributes that make bitcoin so unique (e.g, freedom to transact globally without permission from a third party).Based on this data, I fear many of these smaller bitcoin holders are letting a great opportunity to build wealth via holding BTC slip through their fingers. Also, buy not buying bitcoin directly and holding it in self-custody, as opposed to purchasing shares of the ETFs, investors are missing out on what it truly means to own censorship resistant sovereign money. Such a feeling often has the effect of making investors hold bitcoin for the long-term as opposed selling in the short-term based on fear.The smart money knows exactly what opportunity is here, and they don't care too much about the freedom aspects of Bitcoin. They're just filling their BTC bags in a vehicle that suits them better. Cheap BTC does not last forever. Major players will continue scooping up huge swaths of shares of the ETFs as we hit a new all time highs and beyond. If there's one thing I leave you with today: Don't sell your BTC to the corporations, and hold the keys to your coins.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,"Lessons From Running Bitrefill, Premier Bitcoin E-Commerce Platform","Tue, 01 Oct 2024 16:43:38 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/lessons-from-running-bitrefill-premier-bitcoin-e-commerce-platform,"10 years ago, Sergej Kotliar set out to help people more easily spend their bitcoin on everyday items, a task that still comes with a number of challenges and that has taught him many lessons.","Company Name: BitrefillFounders: Sergej Kotliar + othersDate Founded: 2014Number of Employees: 76Website: https://www.bitrefill.com/Public or Private? PrivateSince 2014, Bitrefill has been helping users spend their bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on everything from gift cards to mobile phone top ups to eSims.One might think that, after a decade, the company’s leadership has uncovered the secret to growing Bitrefill with relative ease. However, one of Bitrefill’s co-founders and its CEO, Sergej Kotliar, says that the company still faces a number of challenges in broadening its user base.“The main difficulty continuously in our company is finding customers,” Kotliar told Bitcoin Magazine.“It's difficult because it's still a niche. Especially people who use some kind of internet money in a wallet app on a regular basis is some small percentage or even a fractional percentage spread out across the world,” he added, referring to the less than 10% of the world’s population that owns crypto, and even fewer who use it regularly.“You need to figure out how to reach them.”While Kotliar and the team at Bitrefill may not yet have reached every potential customer out there, they’ve learned a lot about what to do and what not to do to keep a crypto company alive through multiple bitcoin epochs.In my conversation with Kotliar, he shared with me some of the lessons he’s learned.Lesson 1: Don’t Believe The HypeKotliar claims that one of the biggest illusions in the bitcoin and broader crypto space is that communities of crypto enthusiasts and users are bigger than they actually are. This becomes particularly dangerous when founders of crypto startups get lured into believing the hype on social media about their company.“There is definitely a phenomenon where a startup launches, they get cheers on Twitter, they very quickly sort of manage to convey their message and their value proposition to that audience who might be inclined to use their thing and are able to convert them — and then they hit the wall,” explained Kotliar.“The people that they acquired in that way are also very opinionated, which makes it difficult to go outside of that group. Companies get stuck because they become captured by their initial audience, which, in the best case scenario, are customers, but, in the mid scenario, are just fans — people on Twitter that don't really need whatever the company is offering,” he added.For this reason, Kotliar focuses less on what people have to say about Bitrefill on social media and more on providing the best possible customer experience.This includes constantly adding more items and services people can purchase with bitcoin and crypto via the site as well as developing new products like the Bitrefill Card, which lets users spend their crypto just like a traditional debit card lets users spend fiat.According to Kotliar, avoiding the crypto echo chamber and focusing on solving real problems for customers has been key to his company’s success.Lesson 2: Stay Alive — Without Requiring VC FundingBitrefill has survived for 10 years because it’s capable of standing on its own two feet financially, without requiring repeated doses of venture capital funding to remain afloat.“There are companies that are default dead, and there are companies that are default alive,” he explained.“This means if the current trajectory continues, is it going to be a dead company with no extra funding or is it going to be a live company? When you reach that ‘we're default alive’ point, it lets you focus more on the things that matter and less on the things that will attract investment,” he added.Kotliar went on to share that “things that attract investment in our industry often are not necessarily the things that require customers,” alluding to the fact that hype tends to drive investment in the crypto space more than a company meeting certain qualitative standards.Focusing on the things that matter, like helping customers easily spend their crypto on gift cards for almost anything as well as other services, has been essential in keeping Bitrefill in business for ten years, despite the inherent waves of volatility in the Bitcoin and crypto space.Lesson 3: Ride The Waves And Learn To SwimOne of the secrets to surviving as a Bitcoin or crypto company is learning how to keep a business afloat during market downturns. It’s easy for crypto companies to keep their doors open and even thrive when the bull market is in full swing, but only the strong survive when the bear market comes around.“During a bull market, we grow very rapidly, and during the bear market, we manage to stay flat,” Kotliar explained.“A lot of companies in our industry, in a bear market, will go under and fire people. We're not like that, but it definitely takes a lot of swimming to remain in the same place,” he added.The fact that Bitrefill serves customers in over 180 different countries also helps to keep it alive, as new waves of adoption happen in different countries at different times for a variety of different reasons.Kotliar says Bitrefill often experiences “regional waves” of adoption.“There's currently a wave going on in Argentina,” he said. “There is this 30% tax on foreign transactions, and so some Argentinians are using Bitrefill to buy games and stuff like that to avoid the 30% tax.”Lesson 4: Be Where The People Are (Or Where They Might Be)Despite the fact that Bitcoin and crypto have become more mainstream in the 10 years that Bitrefill has existed, Kotliar comes back to the point that to be successful as a company you have to aim to serve everyday people versus solely the Bitcoin enthusiast.“The world doesn’t care,” said Kotliar about Bitcoin ideology.“In the Bitcoin world, some parts of it care more about which features you don't offer as opposed to which features you do offer, which is strange. Nobody would go to a store and be like, ‘Hey, you also sell this stuff!’” said Kotliar, referring to the notion that some Bitcoin enthusiasts have taken issue with the fact that Bitrefill accepts other cryptocurrencies.Kotliar argues that users tend to be indifferent to what other technologies do and don’t offer, so long as they serve the purpose they need them to serve.“You seem to care about the Riverside [FM],” said Kotliar, referring to the app I used to record my interview with him, “but I don't know if you would go to a conference about it or get into an argument with someone over a feature that it has or maybe a feature that it should not have.”He went on to explain that Bitrefill accepts different cryptocurrencies for different reasons, one of which is meeting the consumer where it’s at, a core tenet of Kotliar’s approach. He shared that the core of Bitrefill’s strategy is getting the product in front of people who otherwise wouldn’t seek something like it out. He wants people to stumble upon it, which he claims “doesn’t always happen by itself.”“The big takeaway is that it's not enough to be at the Bitcoin conference,” he said. “You need to be in where people are, especially the people that do not particularly care about Bitcoin.”Lesson 5: Listen, Don’t SpeakSome of Bitrefill’s growth has been fueled by its being receptive to feedback from users.“We get a lot of feedback, and we have all kinds of channels open,” said Kotliar. “I think that the main function of marketing is actually to listen more than to speak.”Kotliar also noted that this process requires some discretion.“We try to listen in every channel, but then also try to figure out — to sift,” he explained, pointing out the company gets its fair share of messages from people pushing certain tokens.“[We] find out what the real requests are, and if you get enough real requests, you get a sense that this is real,” he added, referring to the suggestions that the company ends up taking seriously.What’s Next For Bitrefill?After 10 years, Bitrefill’s mission remains the same: focusing on what best serves customers (and ignoring the noise in the process).“We have a whole team now that's working on adding gift cards,” said Kotliar, “and we're still putting a lot of effort into the Bitrefill Card.”While Kotliar believes that Bitrefill is “the best in the world at everything Bitcoin payment related,” he and his team are currently looking into adding functionality for stablecoins on Lightning.Other than that, it’s business as usual at Bitrefill.“Our aim is to be the, you know, the one stop shop for everything day to day usage of cryptocurrency in the real world,” said Kotliar.“That's where we're putting our attention.”"
Bitcoin Magazine,RIZZO: SATOSHI NAKAMOTO'S NEW MYSTERY,"Tue, 01 Oct 2024 11:15:56 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/satoshi-nakamoto-2009-bitcoin-mining-missing-blocks-mystery,It’s 2024 and there’s a new mystery surfacing around Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto – this time relating to his mining activity in 2009.,"WHO WE’RE FOLLOWING: Wicked BitcoinIt’s 2024 and there’s a new mystery surfacing around Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto.


In this case, discussion of a new enigma first surfaced on X, where everyone’s favorite ch-artist Wicked Bitcoin posted the discovery.Essentially, the finding boils down to this:It’s clear that Satoshi Nakamoto was an early Bitcoin miner – after all, he sent bitcoins to early contributors, and since he didn’t set himself up with a sweet “founder’s allocation,” they could have only come from mining.That said, we don’t really know how many bitcoins Satoshi mined. (He never commented on it publicly, aside from one reported instance where he claimed to ""own a lot"" of bitcoins.) Most of what’s “common knowledge” is from one study done in 2013, and while it’s become something like lore, there’s a lot of dispute about what it proves. Essentially, the study suggested Satoshi’s mining activity was visible on the blockchain via what’s been called the “Patoshi pattern.” Long story short, an early, very large miner changed the way they embedded data on the blockchain (via a non-standard iteration of the ExtraNonce), and most believe that this could have only been done by Nakamoto (who knew the most about the software in its infancy). Jameson Lopp (co-founder of Casa) built on this work in 2022. He added new analysis about this mystery miner, including the finding that they weren't seeking to maximize their profitability. Some felt this was another strong data point Patoshi was Satoshi.Now, Wicked is adding to the mystery, one that alludes to earlier “Patoshi” analyses. Essentially, by plotting this miner’s blocks on a date-time axis, he finds that there’s a notable gap in the timestamps of this miner’s blocks in early 2009.Of course, as to what we can conclude from this data, as Wicked’s comments section shows, that’s up for debate. Adding to the issue is that here is a dearth of historical information about Bitcoin from 2009. What’s been uncovered amounts to a few public email lists and private correspondences that have been published over the years (some forced by court hearings). As far back as May-June 2009, there were no Bitcoin forums, and it’s possible there could have been only a dozen people mining the network. Martii Malmi, (Satoshi’s first real righthand developer) would have only just been starting his work.This means that we don’t really have a concrete timeline or what occurred and why besides what’s visible by looking at the data, and there, there isn’t even that much to discuss – there were many days in 2009 where there weren’t any Bitcoin transactions. Wicked’s thesis here is that the above gaps show instances where the “Patoshi miner” went offline, and then had to restart operations. At this point, the miner was so powerful that they simply overwrote any blocks found by other miners in their absence.Wicked draws a few conclusions from this, going so far as to suggest Satoshi may have been testing how well the network held up to “51% attacks.” This would be plausible – after all, the idea that Bitcoin was robust enough to operate as long as a majority of participants were honest was his major contribution to digital cash as a concept. (Really, you could argue (as I have) that’s the only thing Satoshi brough to Bitcoin that was new, his primary skill taking hardened computer science concepts and stitching them together.)That said, there's a bit of a bearish read here. An accidental 51% attack would have still made honest mining moot, and this could be fodder for critics who like to paint Satoshi as the kind of errant experimenter we see on other chains today. Still, there’s a lot of conjecture here, and without more analysis (or more corroborating evidence) it’s hard to draw a firm conclusion. At any rate, we can marvel at the mystery that nearly 16 years later, Satoshi has succeeded so well in hiding his tracks from history. "
Bitcoin Magazine,Ocean’s DATUM Is Tackling Bitcoin’s Most Pressing Problem,"Mon, 30 Sep 2024 17:28:43 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/aaron-oceans-datum-is-tackling-bitcoins-most-pressing-problem,"Ocean's DATUM is since this weekend putting transaction selection back into the hands of hashers, benefiting Bitcoin's censorship resistance.","


Since censorship resistance is arguably its core value proposition, I seriously doubt that Bitcoin would, in this scenario, have much long-term viability at all.It’s difficult to find a more fundamental threat to Bitcoin’s continued existence than mining centralization. 


If —say— there are only a few mining pools, there is a very real possibility that these organizations face regulatory pressure of the kind that exchanges have also had to deal with: they could be forced to only include KYC’ed transactions into blocks. Since censorship resistance is arguably its core value proposition, I seriously doubt that Bitcoin would, in this scenario, have much long-term viability at all.To that end, it was great to see Ocean launch DATUM (Decentralized Alternative Templates for Universal Mining) this weekend. Similar to Stratum V2 (implemented by Demand Pool), DATUM allows miners (or: “hashers”) to select the transactions they include in the blocks they find, while still splitting the block reward with other users of the pool. In other words, hashers get the benefit of pooled mining, without having to outsource transaction selection to the Ocean pool operators, thus making it more difficult to enforce regulation. (It’s much easier to regulate a few big businesses —mining pools— in a handful of jurisdictions, than it is to regulate many smaller businesses and individuals —hashers— from around the world.)Of course, the adversarial mindset will recognize that this doesn’t in itself solve the problem of mining centralization in its entirety. Most obviously, draconian lawmakers could ultimately just ban this type of pooled mining altogether. Besides, it’s not really clear that there is a demand from hashers to construct their own blocks in the first place– though that might of course quickly change if and when there in fact is regulatory pressure that stops pools from including certain transactions in blocks. (And Ocean is providing an incentive for hashers to select their own transactions by cutting fees for those that make use of the new feature.)Either way, DATUM is an important step in the right direction. If nothing else, it should take away a lot of the concerns of Ocean themselves refusing to include certain “spam” transactions in their blocks: now every hasher can decide for themselves what transactions they do and do not want to include.The more difficult it is to thwart Bitcoin’s censorship resistance, the brighter Bitcoin’s future looks.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Inside Lebanon’s Currency Crisis: How Hyperinflation Feels,"Mon, 30 Sep 2024 16:44:27 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/inside-lebanons-currency-crisis-how-hyperinflation-feels-,A look at the lived experience of going through hyperinflation in Lebanon.,"Lebanon is back in the headlines as the conflict in the Middle East intensifies. Before these latest developments, Lebanon had already become a symbol of how quickly a seemingly stable society can descend into chaos. If you follow major events in the global economy, you’ll probably recall that Lebanon’s recent past serves as a vivid example of what a full-blown currency collapse looks like in a modern, advanced economy. While there are some great books that describe hyperinflation in detached, academic terms, what’s often missing is the human story – what it’s actually like to be a normal, productive person with a family and a bank account, and to live through the collapse of your country’s currency.For a while now, I’ve known that my friend Tony Yazbeck, co-founder of The Bitcoin Way, had experienced this reality. But it wasn’t until I watched this interview with him that I realized how valuable his story is for everyone to hear. Tony’s story offers a rare, personal glimpse into what it means when your country’s banking system disintegrates, when you lose access to your savings, when food prices rise 10-fold in a few months, and when even basic necessities like medicine and fuel become luxuries. I asked Tony if he could explain not only why Lebanon collapsed, but also how bitcoin could have been a lifeline in such a dire situation.Lebanon: A country on the brinkBefore its economic collapse, Lebanon was a vibrant, cosmopolitan country, often called the ""Paris of the Middle East."" Its economy thrived on banking, tourism, and services, positioning it as a bridge between East and West. For Tony, this prosperity wasn’t an illusion—it was his daily life. ""My life in Lebanon was extraordinary,"" he recalls. ""I ran three thriving businesses and lived a luxurious lifestyle. Whether it was the latest cars, the best restaurants, or the hottest clubs, Beirut had it all.""Yet beneath the surface, cracks were forming. Lebanon’s banking sector, once a source of pride, was built on unsustainable practices, and the country was drowning in debt. For years, Lebanon’s central bank had pegged the Lebanese pound to the U.S. dollar at an artificially high rate, creating a false sense of stability. This currency peg required constant inflows of dollars to maintain. When those inflows dried up, the house of cards collapsed.In 2019, Lebanon’s banks began restricting access to savings, imposing informal capital controls without any legal framework. ""Overnight, people lost access to their funds,"" Tony says. ""You couldn’t withdraw your own money, and even if you could, it was in Lebanese pounds that were rapidly losing value."" For those unfamiliar with a currency crisis, the limitation of bank withdrawals is one of the first signs that the system is failing. The government and banks try to delay the inevitable by locking down money in the system. By then, it’s too late.From thriving businesses to $70 in handIn early 2020, Lebanon defaulted on its foreign debt, and the value of the Lebanese pound plummeted. Hyperinflation set in, destroying the purchasing power of ordinary people. Tony watched helplessly as his savings evaporated and his businesses crumbled. ""I went from being a successful entrepreneur to having just $70 to my name in what felt like the blink of an eye,"" he recalls. ""I couldn’t pay rent, school fees, or even afford basic groceries.""Hyperinflation took hold with shocking speed. ""A loaf of bread that once cost 1,500 LBP shot up to over 30,000 LBP within months,"" Tony explains. Fuel prices were even worse. ""In early 2023, a gallon of gas went from 25,000 LBP to over 500,000 LBP in just a few weeks. It was impossible to keep up with the prices.""The destruction wasn’t limited to material wealth; the psychological toll was immense. Tony describes the anxiety and panic that came with watching his hard-earned success disappear. ""For the first time in my life, I didn’t know what to do. I felt completely helpless.”.A fractured civil societyAs Lebanon’s currency collapsed, so did its social fabric. People who once lived comfortable, middle-class lives suddenly found themselves struggling for survival. Basic goods became scarce, and the price of everyday items skyrocketed. Power dynamics within communities shifted as those who controlled essentials like food and fuel gained disproportionate influence. ""There were reports of gangs taking over neighborhoods, controlling access to goods and demanding protection fees,"" Tony recalls.Even electricity became a luxury. With the national grid in shambles, most people had to rely on private generators, but the cost of running them was astronomical. ""Monthly generator fees jumped from 200,000 LBP to over 4,000,000 LBP,"" Tony explains. Many families were forced to live without power for long stretches of time.In response to the crisis, people turned to alternative forms of exchange. Bartering became common, with people trading goods and services directly. ""If you couldn’t pay in cash, you might offer plumbing work in exchange for groceries,"" Tony says. The U.S. dollar, already widely used before the collapse, became the default currency for many transactions. Digital currencies, and especially stable coins like Tether (USDT), also gained traction as people sought ways to preserve value outside the collapsing banking system.What could have been: Bitcoin as a lifelineAs Tony recounts the collapse, questions loom large: Could this have been prevented? Or at the very least, could individuals have somehow protected themselves better? For Tony, the answer is clear: Yes – with access to bitcoin, many of the worst effects of the crisis might have been avoided.""If I had known about bitcoin before the crisis, it could have saved me,"" Tony says without hesitation. ""Bitcoin would have given me a way to store value outside the banking system, which completely failed. I wouldn’t have been locked out of my own savings, and I could have preserved my wealth as the Lebanese pound collapsed.""Bitcoin is immune to the kind of capital controls Lebanon’s banks imposed in 2019. No government or bank can freeze your bitcoin or restrict access to it. In a country where the banking system became a trap, bitcoin would have provided a way out.Even as Lebanon’s currency lost over 90% of its value, bitcoin held its purchasing power globally. ""Bitcoin isn’t tied to any government or central bank, so it can’t be manipulated the way the Lebanese pound was,"" Tony explains. ""It’s a hedge against hyperinflation, which would have been critical when prices were doubling and tripling every few months.""Bitcoin’s status as a digital bearer asset would have been equally important. ""When cash becomes worthless and banks stop functioning, how do you pay for things? How do you trade?"" Tony asks. In Lebanon, bartering and informal exchanges became necessary for survival. In many situations, bitcoin may have served as a viable alternative to barter, worthless Lebanese pounds, and U.S. dollars that were difficult to obtain.Lessons for the worldLebanon’s crisis offers a stark warning to the rest of the world. While many people in developed countries believe that their economies are too stable to collapse in such a way, Tony’s experience should give us pause. ""What happened to me could happen anywhere,"" he warns. ""Don’t think you’re immune just because you live in a so-called stable country. The mechanics of fiat currency are the same everywhere.""Tony points to the U.S. as an example of a country that is walking the same dangerous path as Lebanon. ""The U.S. national debt now exceeds $35 trillion. Since 1971, when the dollar was taken off the gold standard, the money supply has increased by over 8,000%. That kind of money printing can’t go on forever.""While the U.S. benefits from being the issuer of the world’s reserve currency, that status isn’t guaranteed indefinitely. ""All fiat currencies are headed to zero eventually,"" Tony cautions. ""Some will fail sooner than others, but they will all fail. The U.S. dollar might be the last to go, but its turn is coming.""The lessons from Lebanon’s collapse are clear: Protect your wealth before a crisis hits, and don’t assume that your government or banking system will be there to save you when things go south. For Tony, that means turning to bitcoin. ""Bitcoin is the only asset that’s truly un-confiscatable,"" he says. ""It’s the only way to escape a broken system.""A new mission to rebuild with bitcoinIn the aftermath of Lebanon’s collapse, Tony has dedicated his life to helping others avoid the same fate. He founded The Bitcoin Way, a bitcoin education and technical services business designed to teach people how to use bitcoin to protect themselves from currency crises. ""The crisis forced me to study and understand money,"" Tony says. ""I realized that the fiat system is a scam, designed by thieves to steal and control us. Bitcoin is the solution.""Every day, Tony educates his clients about how to take control of their financial future using bitcoin. ""Once you understand how bitcoin works, you see the flaws in traditional fiat systems,"" Tony explains. ""You learn how to manage your assets securely, make transactions independently of banks, and protect your wealth from inflation and economic instability.""The road aheadTony believes that the collapse of the Lebanese pound was avoidable, but that would have required structural reforms that never came. ""If Lebanon had tackled corruption, maintained transparency, and adjusted the currency peg responsibly, things might have turned out differently,"" he says.But given the deep-rooted corruption in Lebanon’s political and financial systems, the collapse was almost inevitable.As Tony reflects on his experience, he sees parallels between pre-crisis Lebanon and the current state of many developed economies. ""We’re seeing the same issues – rising debt, unsustainable monetary policies, and corrupt institutions,"" he says. The warning signs are there, but many people ignore them, believing that their country is somehow different.For those who are paying attention, Tony offers practical advice. ""Start educating yourself about bitcoin now, before it’s too late,"" he urges. ""Diversify your assets and don’t rely on fiat currency to preserve your wealth. The mechanics of hyperinflation don’t change just because you live in a wealthy country.""Lebanon’s collapse is not just a cautionary tale for people living in developing economies. It’s a wake-up call for the entire world. As governments continue to print money at unprecedented rates, the risk of a global currency crisis grows. Bitcoin offers a way out – an inflation-proof alternative that can protect the wealth of individuals when fiat currencies fail.Tony’s experience is a stark reminder of the fragility of fiat systems and the importance of financial sovereignty. ""With bitcoin in your custody, you have the power to protect yourself from corruption, manipulation, and inflation,"" Tony says.""You don’t need permission from a bank or a government to manage your own money. And that’s exactly what makes bitcoin the ultimate tool for financial freedom.""This is a guest post by Dave Birnbaum.

Bitcoin Magazine,"NIKOLAUS: Business Insider Says Trump And Harris Both Courting The Bitcoin Vote, But Reality Says Otherwise","Mon, 30 Sep 2024 16:19:29 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/nikolaus-business-insider-says-trump-and-harris-both-courting-the-bitcoin-vote-but-reality-says-otherwise,"Kamala Harris has done nothing to confirm she will support or protect the industry so far, while her political opponent is going above and beyond for it.","




Follow Nikolaus on X

Business Insider published a new report today on where Bitcoin currently stands in regards to the upcoming U.S. presidential election, with exactly what you would expect from a left leaning mainstream media outlet. The article states that “Trump and Harris have different reasons to try to attract the crypto community”, and while I agree it is true that it would be good for both candidates to win over this vote, only one of them has actually put in the work to do so. The article begins by noting how Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency at large, is not at the top of the list of priorities for most voters nationwide, which I actually believe to be true. Earlier this summer I got the opportunity to attend the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and even there after everything Trump had said about supporting this industry, there was no broader discussion going on about it amongst anyone there really. There was also no discussion on it at the Democratic National Convention (DNC). Most voters do care about more prominent issues such as the illegal immigration problem, inflation, crime, and more. But I think this does appear to be changing, in more ways than they may think.Business Insider continues the typical mainstream media narrative that this industry is just a bunch of “crypto bros” and how “maybe” the vote of a “dogecoin-loving guy” in a swing state might be important in deciding the upcoming election. They then flip flop and joke about just because someone might own $50 worth of Bitcoin, that it won’t play a factor in them deciding on who to vote for in this upcoming election. But they fail to recognize two important factors that negate their jabs at the industry.Bitcoin has officially crossed the chasm and is now backed by traditional financial institutions, including BlackRock, Fidelity, etc. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager, and they’re not here to play around like the “crypto bros” Business Insider suggests. They’re here to make money, and their spot Bitcoin ETFs have been the fastest growing ETFs in history. The customers of their ETFs range from all different classes of investors, who also want to see this asset class soar. These large asset managers are amassing an army of new Bitcoin holders who come from traditional financial backgrounds, and I’m sure will want to make their voices heard this November.Also, earlier this year, CNBC reported that half of Americans have $500 or less in their savings account, and 60% have $500 or less in their checking accounts. Americans have a savings problem, as CNBC noted, “The lack of cash in either savings or checking accounts suggests that many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.” Everyone has to start saving from somewhere, and those with $50 worth of BTC will vote for who will advance their best interests, like building up their financial savings. So holders of BTC should not be written off because of the amount of BTC they may own when it comes to voting. So far, only Donald Trump has put in the effort to appeal to this group of voters. Former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had also pledged to support the Bitcoin industry, but he dropped out to support Trump. Trump has gone above and beyond to earn the support of the Bitcoin and broader crypto industry, including speaking at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville earlier this summer, promising to help BTC miners get all the electricity they need for mining, promising to build a strategic stockpile of BTC for the country’s reserves, and so much more.Meanwhile, Kamala Harris has said literally nothing on the Bitcoin industry let alone support it. She declined to speak at the same Bitcoin conference in Nashville this past summer, and has not added Bitcoin into the Democratic party platform like the Republicans did. She has attacked the Bitcoin industry non-stop since getting into office with Joe Biden almost four years ago. Business Insider touches on her lack of comments on Bitcoin, but attempts to frame it in a more bi-partisan way, as if she is going to support the industry in a similar fashion as to Trump.And this is where I disagree with many when it comes to this issue. I believe Bitcoin is 100% a partisan issue in this country. I watch all the senate and congressional hearings when it comes to Bitcoin related topics, and witness how the majority of Republicans vote in favor of Bitcoin, while the majority of Democrats vote against it. Democrats vote in favor of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) while most Republicans vote against CBDC. There is a clear dividing line, being further proven by Trump being heavily pro-Bitcoin and Kamala being reluctant to support the industry.If Kamala wanted to support the industry, she would have taken the time to do so by now. She has yet to even say the word Bitcoin publicly. She did say she would support “blockchain” in a recent speech, but based on her previous years of hostility, and the general directions Democrats vote, one can only assume she means CBDC and not supporting Bitcoin. A few times over the course of the last few months, Harris’ campaign has hinted at potentially supporting the industry, but has not acted on it in any way, leaving more empty promises.Which leaves me to believe that if she wanted to support this industry, she would have by now — no excuses. Trump went to PubKey, a Bitcoin themed bar in NYC, purchasing almost $1,000 worth of burgers and drinks for everyone there using the Bitcoin Lightning Network, just a couple days after an assassination attempt on him. If Trump can do that, and Kamala can’t even get in front of a microphone and camera and say the word Bitcoin, then it is clear what their stances on the matter are.After explaining all of Kamala’s shortcomings in supporting the Bitcoin industry, Business Insider ends the article by stating that “What Harris or Trump will actually do on crypto is unclear, but that's not really the point right now.” This is pure gas lighting, considering Trump has put forth clear policies on the matter, while Kamala has not. And since she underperformed him in attempting to win over this vote, they try to pivot to suggest 'oh that’s not really the point right now, that’s not what matters'. But it is what matters. It is reported that there are over 50 million people in the U.S. who own Bitcoin and crypto, they are spread out all across the country, and want their interests advanced this November. While Bitcoin is not near the top of the list of priorities for the average American, it is for those interested in this asset class. This ever growing voter bloc is dedicated to their cause and they are not willing to budge on the issue. So far, only Trump has taken the effort to support and get involved in this industry, while Kamala seems like she couldn’t care less about it."
Bitcoin Magazine,Maximizing Bitcoin Gains with ETF Data,"Fri, 27 Sep 2024 16:09:58 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/maximizing-bitcoin-gains-with-etf-data-,Outperforming Bitcoin: A Simple ETF Data Strategy for Higher Returns 🚀,"Maximizing Bitcoin Gains with ETF DataSince the introduction of Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in early 2024, Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs, with multiple months of double-digit gains. However, as impressive as this performance is, there's a way to significantly outperform Bitcoin's returns by utilizing ETF data to guide your trading decisions.Bitcoin ETFs and Their InfluenceBitcoin ETFs, launched in January 2024, have quickly amassed large amounts of Bitcoin. These ETFs, tracked by various funds, allow institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning it. These ETFs have accumulated billions of USD worth of BTC, and tracking this cumulative flow is essential for monitoring institutional activity in Bitcoin markets, helping us gauge whether institutional players are buying or selling.

Figure 1: BTC ETF Cumulative Flows (USD) have surpassed $18.5b. View Live Chart 🔍

ETF daily inflows denominated in BTC indicate that large-scale investors are accumulating Bitcoin, while daily outflows suggest they are exiting positions during that trading period. For those looking to outperform Bitcoin's already strong 2024 performance, this ETF data offers a strategic entry and exit point for Bitcoin trades.

Figure 2: BTC ETF Daily Flows (BTC) show regular accumulation of over 10,000 BTC per day. View Live Chart 🔍

A Simple Strategy Based on ETF DataThe strategy is relatively straightforward: buy Bitcoin when ETF inflows are positive (green bars) and sell when outflows occur (red bars). Surprisingly, this method allows you to outperform even during Bitcoin's bullish periods.This strategy, while simple, has consistently outperformed the broader Bitcoin market by capturing price momentum at the right moments and avoiding potential downturns by following institutional trends.

Figure 3: Each trade following this institutional inflow/outflow strategy.

The Power of CompoundingThe real secret to this strategy lies in compounding. Compounding gains over time significantly boosts your returns, even during periods of consolidation or minor volatility. Imagine starting with $100 in capital. If your first trade yields a 10% return, you now have $110. On the next trade, another 10% gain on $110 brings your total to $121. Compounding these gains over time, even modest wins, accumulate into significant profits. Losses are inevitable, but compounding wins far outweigh the occasional dip.Since the launch of the Bitcoin ETFs, this strategy has provided over 100% returns during a period in which just holding BTC has returned roughly 37%, or even compared to buying Bitcoin on the ETF launch day and selling at the exact all-time high, which would have returned approximately 59%.

Figure 4: Over 100% compounded gains since ETF launch following this strategy.

Can Further Upside Be Expected?Recently, we’ve begun to see a sustained trend of positive ETF inflows, suggesting that institutions are once again heavily accumulating Bitcoin. Since September 19th, every day has seen positive inflows, which, as we can see, have often preceded price rallies. BlackRock and their IBIT ETF alone have accumulated over 379,000 BTC since inception.

Figure 5: BlackRock alone has accumulated over 379,000 BTC in just a few months. View Live Chart 🔍

ConclusionMarket conditions can change, and there will inevitably be periods of volatility. However, the consistent historical correlation between ETF inflows and Bitcoin price increases makes this a valuable tool for those looking to maximize their Bitcoin gains. If you’re looking for a low-effort, set-it-and-forget-it approach, buy-and-hold may still be suitable. However, if you want to try and actively increase your returns by leveraging institutional data, tracking Bitcoin ETF inflows and outflows could be a game-changer.For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out a recent YouTube video here: Using ETF Data to Outperform Bitcoin [Must Watch]"
Bitcoin Magazine,Tornado Cash Loses Motion to Dismiss,"Fri, 27 Sep 2024 13:52:18 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/tornado-cash-loses-motion-to-dismiss,A short summary of the recent decision regarding the Tornado Cash case.,"The judge in the Tornado Cash case delivered an oral ruling today, rejecting both the Defense’s motion to compel discovery and their motion to dismiss the charges. This represents a massive setback for the Defense, and the judge’s reasoning may not bode well for developers and projects going forward.Motion to CompelThe Defense's motion to compel discovery sought to access a broad range of government communications, including exchanges with foreign authorities under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) and with domestic agencies like the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Citing Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16, the Defense argued that these materials were essential to understanding the government's case and could potentially include exculpatory evidence. The judge, however, made it clear that Rule 16 imposes a stringent requirement: the Defense must show that the requested information is material to their case, not merely speculate on its potential usefulness.The court dismissed the Defense’s arguments as speculative, noting that references to what the information ""might"" or ""could"" reveal do not meet the necessary standard for materiality. For example, the Defense argued that MLAT communications with the Dutch government might shed light on the evidence against Tornado Cash or reveal the government’s investigative theories. The judge found this reasoning unpersuasive, emphasizing that materiality cannot be established through conjecture or vague assertions.The court similarly rejected the Defense’s request for all communications between the government and OFAC and FinCEN. Although the Defense claimed these documents were necessary to understand the government's theories and potential witnesses, the judge concluded that the Defense failed to demonstrate how these communications were directly relevant to the charges at hand. The court reiterated that the burden is on the Defense to show a specific link between the requested documents and their defense strategy, a burden they did not meet.When the Defense suggested an in-camera review—a private examination by the judge of the requested documents—to determine their materiality, the court refused. The judge argued that granting such a request based on speculative assertions would set a dangerous precedent, effectively forcing in-camera reviews in all criminal cases when a defendant speculates about the relevance of certain documents. This, the judge stressed, would undermine the purpose of Rule 16 and transform the pretrial discovery process into an unrestrained search for potentially helpful evidence.The Defense also raised concerns under Brady v. Maryland, arguing that the government might be withholding exculpatory or impeachable evidence. While the court acknowledged the government's obligations under Brady, it found no indication that these duties had been neglected. Without concrete evidence suggesting the government was withholding information, the court saw no reason to compel additional disclosures. The judge cautioned that while the Defense’s arguments were theoretically possible, they lacked the factual support needed to warrant the court’s intervention. She did say, however, that if she later finds that the government has “interpreted its obligations too narrowly” then there will be “unfortunate consequences for their case.”Motion to DismissThe motion to dismiss presented a much more significant set of issues. Central to the Defense's argument was the definition of a ""money transmitter"" under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). The Defense contended that Tornado Cash did not qualify as a money transmitter because it did not exercise control over users’ funds; it merely facilitated the movement of cryptocurrencies. The court, however, rejected this narrow interpretation. The judge clarified that the BSA's scope does not require the control of the funds; Tornado Cash’s role in facilitating, anonymizing, and transferring cryptocurrency was sufficient to bring it within the statute’s ambit. The judge likened Tornado Cash to custodial mixers, which have been deemed money transmitting businesses.Further complicating the Defense's argument was their reliance on the 2019 FinCEN guidance, which uses a four-factor test to determine whether a wallet provider is a money transmitter. The Defense claimed this guidance, which includes a “total independent control” standard, should apply to Tornado Cash. The court disagreed, stating that this standard is specific to wallet providers and does not extend to mixers like Tornado Cash. Consequently, Tornado Cash’s lack of “total independent control” over funds was irrelevant to its classification as a money transmitter.Another key point in the court’s analysis was the distinction between expressive and functional code under the First Amendment. The Defense argued that prosecuting Storm for his involvement with Tornado Cash was tantamount to punishing him for writing code, which they claimed was protected speech. The judge acknowledged that while code can be considered expressive, the specific use of code to facilitate illegal activities—such as money laundering or sanctions evasion—falls outside the bounds of First Amendment protection. The judge emphasized that the court must focus on the conduct enabled by the code, not merely the code itself. Even under intermediate scrutiny, which applies to content-neutral restrictions on speech, the judge found that the government’s interests in preventing money laundering and regulating unlicensed money transmission justified the restrictions imposed by the relevant statutes.The court also addressed concerns about the immutability of Tornado Cash’s smart contracts, an issue raised by both parties. The judge acknowledged the existence of a factual dispute but noted that it was not a decisive factor in the current motion. However, the issue of immutability may play a role at trial in determining the extent of Storm’s control over the service and his responsibility for its operations.In concluding remarks, the judge underscored that while the use of code to communicate ideas may be protected under the First Amendment, using that code to facilitate illegal activities is not. This distinction is critical in the context of emerging technologies like blockchain, where the line between speech and conduct can be blurred. The court’s ruling serves as a reminder that the legal system is prepared to hold participants in the digital economy accountable, even as it grapples with the complexities of applying traditional legal principles to new and evolving technologies.The full transcript of the ruling will be released once prepared by the court reporter.This is a guest post by Colin Crossman.

Bitcoin Magazine,"Proof of Reserves: Show Me the Money, Or It Didn’t Happen ","Thu, 26 Sep 2024 16:05:44 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/proof-of-reserves-show-me-the-money-or-it-didnt-happen-,Why Proof of Reserves is a critical piece of infrastructure for any custodial services built on top of Bitcoin. ,"If we claim to be an improvement on traditional finance, we had better start playing the part. It’s clear how Bitcoin fixes rampant monetary discretion. It’s clear, too, how Bitcoin changes your relationship with money—both financially because you’re more inclined to save an appreciating asset—as well as physically because you can do novel things like hold the GDP of a small island nation on a USB. There is one thing, however, that is slowly gaining acceptance and needs to be accepted if we are to truly improve on the mistakes of the past, and that’s Proof of Reserves. Bitcoin has unique audit properties baked into the system itself. Bitcoin allows any third party to audit the entire money supply down to the smallest unit. A third party can do this for free, without any special privileges or permissions. It’s difficult to overestimate how novel and consequential this property of the Bitcoin protocol is and the implications of the guarantees it provides. For context, the total global supply of dollars is an estimate and not an exact number by any stretch of the imagination due to a variety of factors including the existence of physical and digital cash, as well as currency circulation abroad. The total number of gold in existence is also an estimate due to entirely different reasons mainly the lack of certainty when it comes to the volume of mined gold from different mines around the world, gold existing in private hands, gold hoards and stashes, new mining, recycling, and unreported sources. There is no global, trustless, source of truth for any money or commodity other than Bitcoin. And this should be Bitcoin’s driving force moving forward.Proof of Reserves (PoR) has been an important part of the industry since near-inception. The infamous Mt. Gox collapse of 2014 set the stage for much needed transparency. The exchange was hacked, 850,000 BTC (~47,617,204,000 USD at the time of this article) were stolen and their customers were unaware. The funds were drained over the course of a few years before the actual collapse happened. A PoR system would have mitigated further loss of funds as their customers would have seen the exchange's reserves depleting at an alarming rate. If this sounds more like recent memory than an ancient piece of Bitcoin history it’s because the same argument applies to FTX, and the same basic thing happened to FTX. If customers, and the wider market at-large, would have seen the exchanges BTC reserves depleting in real-time (or the fact that FTX had zero Bitcoin), systemic-risk would have been dramatically mitigated.So, what do you think would happen if the single custodian holding 90% of the spot Bitcoin backing these ETF’s were hacked or and/or acted maliciously? Unless the public is notified by the exchange, millions of people would be holding billions of paper Bitcoin. The more we connect ourselves to traditional finance the more cross-risk there is between traditional financial markets and the crypto markets. There are two choices at this point as we continue to mature as an asset class- apply old security and risk management tools to this new technology, or apply new, more performant, standards that are risk-adjusted to ensure we don’t see a systemic collapse if a certain class of financial products experiences a shock.The claim can be made that having auditors is sufficient, that we already have these tools in place and as regulated financial products, this is essentially already “taken care of.” This claim, itself, is valid as imposing audit controls to mitigate risk is, in fact, the best we’ve been able to do thus far as it relates to financial products. But any meaningful investigation into the function of auditors yields alarming results: PwC vs. BDO in the Colonial Bank Case (2017), Grant Thornton vs. PwC (Parmalat Scandal, 2003), BDO vs. Ernst & Young (Banco Espírito Santo, 2014), KPMG vs. Deloitte (Steinhoff Scandal, 2017), and this is only looking back 20 years. FTX and Enron both had auditors. We use auditors because we don’t trust the individuals running the organization and the best we’ve been able to do to date is defer trust over to a different set of people, outside the organization. But the inherent risk of trusting people and organizations has never been remediated until now. Enron’s biblical collapse was due to clear conflict of interests between them and their auditor—namely that Arthur Andersen was also providing lucrative consulting services to Enron in addition to their audit function and by extension helped them cook their books. Bitcoin is different, it behaves and lives differently. It behaves differently because the cryptographic guarantees it exhibits is something incomparable to traditional assets. Just as anyone can audit the entire money supply in the system with trustless guarantees, so too can anyone audit the personal holdings of an individual, or corporation, or ETF, holding Bitcoin in a completely risk-less way. It’s an important note, that it is not risk-mitigated, but risk-less. Someone cryptographically proving to any other counterparty that they own Bitcoin for, say, a loan can do so with no question as to whether the person is the actual owner of the BTC. This can happen repeatedly, with little overhead, and can be monitored continuously in real-time. There is no titling, there is no external auditor, there is no reviewing of any books that needs to take place. That data can be ingested without question.So, what does this mean for ETF products? It should be clear at this point that because ETF products are such a critical pillar of our modern financial system and because Bitcoin introduces unique risk paradigms that old audit standards are inadequately servicing, that new risk infrastructure needs to be applied to these products. The solution is simple and it is the same solution that has been crackling its way up through the ice we’re all standing on in an attempt to get some air. Require spot Bitcoin ETF products to implement and comply with Proof of Reserves regimes. They should be giving their investors the peace of mind that the underlying asset backing these ETF’s exists, that they are sitting in robust custody setups and are not being rehypothecated. A failure to do so, or an unwillingness to do so on the part of the ETF issuer speaks to the priorities of the issuer—namely that they either don’t understand the nature of this particular financial product or that they are more comfortable operating with opacity than transparency. A failure to implement this as a standard industry-wide is simply a ticking time-bomb.Hoseki was created for this very purpose, to build the plumbing that makes financializing Bitcoin a reality starting with PoR. Hoseki helps individuals prove their reserves to counterparties through Hoseki Connect and through Hoseki Verified provides services to private and public corporates, and ETF issuers so they can publicly verify their Bitcoin holdings building better brands, redefining trust, and mitigating risk for a healthier and more robust financial ecosystem.

Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Swap Service Boltz Launches BTCPay Server Plugin For Lightning Payments,"Thu, 26 Sep 2024 13:11:18 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-swap-service-boltz-launches-btcpay-server-plugin-for-lightning-payments,The Boltz BTCPay Plugin enables merchants using BTCPay Server to accept Lightning payments non-custodially and transfer these funds to the Liquid sidechain.,"Today, Boltz announced the launch of the Boltz BTCPay Plugin, the first feature of its kind, in open beta. The plugin lets merchants who use BTCPay Server easily accept bitcoin over Lightning before having it automatically swapped and stored non-custodially on the Liquid Network.The “Nodeless” mode for the Boltz BTCPay Plugin utilizes Liquid Swaps to make the automatic swap from Lightning to Liquid the instant a Lightning invoice is paid. Using Liquid Swaps, Boltz BTCPay Plugin users can also swap bitcoin back to the mainchain if they prefer. The plugin comes with an integrated wallet system, which enables users to create or import both Liquid and mainchain wallets.“Merchants can receive or accept bitcoin by swapping incoming Lightning payments into their Liquid wallets and, like this, they don’t have to operate a node,” Kilian, CEO of Boltz, told Bitcoin Magazine.“What they are holding in the end is LBTC — Liquid BTC,” he added.“We also want to give them an option to automatically swap back to the mainchain if they so choose. They can say, ‘Okay, if my Liquid Bitcoin balance reaches 0.1 bitcoin, 0.5 bitcoin, swap it back to the mainchain.’”Merchants remain in control of their funds at all times while using the service.Boltz designed the plugin to help alleviate the anxiety that comes with running and managing a Lightning node.“Running and managing a Lightning node is no easy feat,” said Boltz CTO Michael in a press release. “Channel management is complex and inbound liquidity can be such an alien concept”.Kilian echoed Michael’s sentiment, as he shared that “running your own Lightning node is neither a realistic nor recommended goal for many individuals, and even for professionals like merchants, as of today.”Previous solutions for accepting Lightning payments without running a node were custodial, introduced counterparty risk or were only available in certain jurisdictions.Given that this plugin is both brand new and the first of its kind, the team at Boltz noted that while the software is ready to be used, users should do so with caution because it could still have bugs. However, Kilian shared that the plugin indeed has handled thousands of transactions and that Strainly, a marketplace for hemp growers, is now completely running on it.“After one month testing the Boltz plugin in front of thousands of users, I can tell this truly is a game-changer,” said Alan, CEO of Strainly, who previously had mixed success using custodial Lightning solutions like LNBank and other Lightning Service Providers (LSPs) “Processing LN payments straight to and from a non-custodial Liquid wallet, plus automatically consolidating the Liquid balance to my non-custodial BTC wallet according to my own preset threshold: hands down the most impactful plugin ever released on BTCPay!”"

He is the second recipient of Maelstrom's grant program supporting open-source Bitcoin developers.Jon is an experienced contributor to Bitcoin Core, having started in 2019. He was also recently made a maintainer of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs).In a statement, Arthur Hayes said, ""We hope this financial support allows Jon to focus on his work on Bitcoin without worrying about income."" Bitcoin's open-source codebase depends on voluntary developers, so grants help enable more contributors to work full-time. Proponents believe having more funded developers benefits Bitcoin's ecosystem.Jon said, ""I'm concerned about human freedom, decentralization of power, individual empowerment, privacy and self-sovereignty. Bitcoin and open source software play a key part in striving for these causes.""He plans to spend the year reviewing proposals and changes to improve Bitcoin Core and BIPs. Jon stated, ""Bitcoin isn't perfect. It needs further decentralization, continued vigilance, review, bug-fixing, updates, maintenance, and improved robustness, performance, privacy, scaling, documentation and user experience.""Maelstrom aims to strengthen Bitcoin through no-strings grants to developers like Atack.

Bitcoin Magazine,There's Three Doors. Which One Will Bitcoin Step Through?,"Wed, 25 Sep 2024 18:25:41 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-three-doors-which-one-will-bitcoin-step-through,"A look at a prolific post by the infamous Mircea Popescu, positing with a rare clairvoyance the possible paths that Bitcoin could take in its road into the future.","


WHAT WE'RE READING: One of the most iconic blog posts in Bitcoin history Mircea Popescu is a mostly forgotten figure in this space, but he was once a very impactful cultural figure early on before he slowly faded out of the wider public sphere to eventually “accidentally” drown off the coast of Costa Rica. He was quite an insane and eccentric, but he has left a lasting impact on this space. I would argue he is essentially the Godfather of what people these days consider “toxic maximalism,” although compared to people who claim that label today he would make them seem like overly sensitive and whiny children. 

Follow Shinobi on X

One of his most prolific posts in my mind was his consideration of the price of Bitcoin and the market dynamics that entails in the long term, from 2013. He was discussing the dynamics of supply and demand interacting with each other, and specifically the mentality of current bitcoin holders in contrast with average consumers that may or may not have an incentive to attempt to accumulate bitcoin in response to the deterioration of the fiat system. He framed the posited friction between these two groups as an impasse, where current holder have no great incentive to part with their bitcoin, and people trying to get rid of their devaluing fiat have no real recourse if holders of bitcoin act in that way. He proposed three possible solutions to that impasse. “One of them is that consumers yield and submit, Bitcoin goes to somewhere in the thousand dollars per range and there's a rush to move society away from the dysfunctional standard. Banks start taking Bitcoin deposits, Bitcoin hedge funds pop up everywhere, the FED chairman, ECB chairman and everyone else come to Timisoara whenever they want to make a move to obtain my blessing and so forth.”This is the path we are seemingly on right now. Capitulation of the existing system, integration into the legacy financial system, the veneration of early adopters and Bitcoin as a solution to the systemic problems of fiat. This is what Bitcoiners currently cheer on in terms of our path forward, citing every tiny piece of news from a banking institution, an ETF, an investment fund, as proof that they are capitulating! We have won! This is pure and utter delusion. Trump pandering to Bitcoiners seeking campaign financing does nothing to truly benefit Bitcoin, he is and will always be a fan of the dollar. His mentality is based around the idea of the money printer, and exporting our inflation globally, being a massively positive thing for American interests. The Democrats overwhelmingly are antagonistic towards the space, for similar reasons. Even if such a future was to truly come to pass, in actuality and not just in name, it would be a very dire and depressing future for anyone who looks to Bitcoin as a tool for freedom and sovereignty. Using Bitcoin would provide that to almost no one. Hedge funds, banks, ETFs, would all be the keyholders for the vast majority of people. No one would truly have any degree of freedom, it would be the same financial system we exist in now where nothing can be done without seeking the permission of some overlord who truly has control of your funds. Regulations would not enable more competition in this sphere, the existing players would take advantage of their revolving doors to encourage capture and high walls around their privileged position in this role. This path would essentially mean failure of Bitcoin as a tool for freedom, and the same game we see being played right now with slightly stricter rules for the privileged few who can get a seat at the table. “Another one of them is that consumers revolt, governments intervene, we all spend the remainder of this decade fighting with each other. Bitcoin also goes to thousands of dollars per, but the energy, effort and resources which could have been expended on comfortably yielding and productively submitting are wasted in an ultimately doomed effort to play tough on a weak hand. Neutral and unengaged governments win, and as the dust settles the balance of macroeconomic power has shifted from the Western world to whatever, China, Iran, Brazil, what have you.”This is the path of them fighting Bitcoin overtly. People actually start switching to Bitcoin en masse, and governments react in a reflexive manner to try to prevent this. Things domino from here as Bitcoin begins to become a more important aspect of global finance outside of the purview of the legacy financial system, and countries that fight and refuse to let it happen wind up just screwing themselves over as smaller and more adaptive jurisdictions who stay out of it or embrace this change wind up benefiting enormously. In this world Western governments make using Bitcoin an enormously difficult task, but people persevere anyway. The rest of the world with a brain stays out of the way, or proactively embraces it, while the West spends all of its effort and resources futilely fighting the inevitable. The rest of the world experiences a financial renaissance, while the Western world stagnates, its citizens forced to fight uphill the entire time to retain any degree of economic success (or even just staying afloat). As brutal as it sounds, this is the world I want to see. One where the West’s domination and coercive control over the rest of the world erodes. We have no special right to lord over the rest of the world in the manner we do, and this path forward would strip us slowly over time of the ability to continue doing so. Citizens of the West can embrace Bitcoin, and stand up for our individual freedoms and sovereignty, and in doing so cushion ourselves from the collapse of our corrupt institutions. A victory in revolution doesn’t come free or easy. For Bitcoin to really do what many of us hope it can, it’s really necessary at the end of the day to walk a painful path. And that means people have to choose to walk it. Many people in this space think that governments will simply roll over and let Bitcoin win, but that is just a feint to move in and capture it. We need to push to build around them, build in parallel, and force their hand. If they don’t actively fight it, then there is something else going on. That isn’t good for us. “Yet another one of them is that consumers revolt, entrepreneurs intervene, before the end of 2015 there's about a thousand to a million different Bitcoin forks, each with its ten million-ish monetary base worth about a dollar, on global average. The size of the inter-Bitcoins market, the complexity and confusion ensuing makes pretty much everything unmanageable for the ""ordinary person"". Hedge funds and banks (the ones a little ahead of using Excel) that trade in this murky complexity make a killing and become the principal driver of economic growth worldwide. Not only is the consumer about as screwed as is currently the case, but to everyone's benefit he has just been clearly proven yet again that revolt = being fucked in the ass harder, longer, with a thicker implement with sharper barbs on it. Also conveniently, the thing to revolt at has become much more vague and intangible. On the balance of probabilities this would seem the most likely outcome, strictly because history unerringly flows in that direction which most cruely rapes the ""average person"".”Popescu rated this as the most likely outcome. Constant fragmentation, Bitcoin shattering into an innumerable number of forks from the original. Each region, or group of people with a different idea, breaking off into their own different networks. Erosion of the network effect until it localizes with more sub-fragments than people can keep track of. Everyone assumes that this is over, that this door was simply a phase we passed through during and in the immediate aftermath of the blocksize wars, and it is closed forever. That is delusional. Nation states are adopting Bitcoin, major financial institutions that essentially write government policy are stepping on stage and integrating it into their systems. The world is a game of coercion and extortion politics, the US invades countries and slaughters hundreds of thousands of people simply to keep the flow of commodities moving in the direction it wants to. To imagine they and other interests wouldn’t fork Bitcoin for their own self interest at a global scale is naive. I would even go so far as to say that opening the first door, the “capitulation” and capture of Bitcoin quickly by these people would almost guarantee that this last door eventually opens. This is a failure of the utmost degree. Fragmentation, no singular network effect that enforces a true scarcity of supply, and more importantly rules, on economic players globally. A brief respite and then immediate return to the game we know now. Complete and utter failure of any form of revolution. All three of these doors are still sitting there, we haven’t walked through any of them yet. It’s anyone’s guess which one we eventually do. Bitcoiners could do with a little humility, and recognition of the fact that not only have we not even come close to winning, but failure is absolutely still on the table. In multiple ways. This article is a Take. Opinions expressed are entirely the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine."
Bitcoin Magazine,Israel Goes Cashless,"Wed, 25 Sep 2024 15:34:43 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/israel-goes-cashless,"Israel’s promoting a new plan to abolish 200 shekel banknotes, forbid possession of physical gold & silver, and use AI for enforcement, while Gaza's state of cash deteriorates. By Efrat Fenigson.","A few days ago, a new initiative promoted by Prime Minister Netanyahu was announced - removing 200 shekel bills from circulation, as a first step to abolish cash altogether within a few years.The official excuse? fighting financial crimes and black money in the Arab society. (For those who aren’t aware, 1.6m citizens in Israel are Arab, which stands for 17% of the country’s population).As expected, this move - identical to India’s move in 2016 - will cause further destabilisation of Israel’s economy and of its citizens’ physical and mental states. A derivative of this economical shake up will ripple into Gaza who is relying on the Israeli shekel as its currency, and clearly, its population is heavily reliant on cash.So let’s break it down.


Abolishing 200 shekel notesThe value of the Israeli 200 shekel bills surpasses 100 billion shekels, and make up nearly 80% of the bank notes held by the public. In recent attempts to smear cash holders, it was reported that “most of the 200 shekel bills are not used for purchases, but for the accumulation of black capital.” A team of so called experts: nine businessmen and former officials in the public sector, who initiated the idea to abolish these bills, claim that the bills’ removal will recover more than 20 billion shekels ($5.3b) by next year, and 110 billion shekels ($29b) in the next 5 years - bringing it back to the state, and will force tax evaders to be revealed.Two weeks ago, the first mainstream media article about this new initiative popped up, to normalize and prepare people for this draconian measure.The proposed policy document suggests several steps to combat black capital:Removing the 200 shekel bills from circulation, as well as broadening the obligation to report on cash holding to the authorities. This is part of a larger plan to abolish cash completely in 3 phases: 1- limit cash transactions to 3,000 shekels ($800) within 2-3 years, 2- lower transaction amount to 2,000 shekels ($530), 3- cancel cash usage completely, while encouraging digital payment methods.Leveraging AI tools for monitoring and enforcing tax evasion,Launching a collaborative enforcement effort that includes various key bodies, such as the Tax Authority, the Anti-Money Laundering Authority, the police, the prosecutor’s office and the Counter-Terrorism Economic Warfare Headquarters.Banning the possession of cash substitutes, such as gold, silver, medals, and coins, on a significant scale.Enhancing regulation of non-banking financial entities, including currency exchange services, which manage significant volumes of illicit funds.Seizure of digital currencies linked to terrorist activities of sanctioned entities - “There are technologies that enable the real-time identification of such money transfers, and Israel needs to implement them immediately. This will allow for disrupting the flow of funds for terrorism and crime, identifying terrorist operatives, and seizing hundreds of millions of dollars for the state, potentially billions in the future”. (This part is from a leaked draft of the plan dated March 2024; it did not appear in mainstream media publications - E.F)Lo and behold, two weeks after the first “suggestion” of this new policy, Prime Minister Netanyahu announced he’s now advancing this reform urgently in order to fight black capital, especially amongst the Arab population, and called in a special committee to discuss the new policy.Israel already introduced a new “big brother” regulation last year, for pre-approving any B2B transaction with the Tax Authority, over 25K shekels. The new policy plan now proposes lowering the threshold for transactions requiring pre-approval from the Tax Authority from 25K shekels ($6,750) to 5K shekels ($1,350), a highly controversial move.Israel’s largest mainstream publication, Ynet, reminded its readers that “Similar steps have been implemented in other countries. In parts of China, the use of cash has been completely banned in certain cities.” Israel’s governing bodies love using “other countries are doing it already too” excuse to justify their acts. The same mantra is being played again and again when the Digital Shekel is mentioned. I recently listened to a podcast with Israel’s Central Bank governor which mentioned favorably how advanced the ECB is with the Digital Euro, for example.I asked Roger Huang, an author and a journalist, about the accuracy of this statement re. China’s cashless cities: “China's central bank actually makes it illegal to not accept cash as a payment option and has punished businesses (http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-01/21/c_139687310.htm) in the past for doing so, even during COVID. This is in direct contradiction to a statement justifying restrictions on cash in Israel that certain cities ban the use of cash. This has not been reported, and with no primary source verified, hard to prove. The Chinese central bank's actions suggest the opposite. Though China is going more cashless and is the most aggressive country at advancing a CBDC/central bank digital currency (the e-CNY/digital yuan), it has not implemented bans or restrictions on using cash - and in fact its central bank punishes those that restrict the use of cash.”• Israel’s is promoting an initiative to abolish the 200 shekel bank notes as a first step to narrow use of & abolishing cash.

My video on the new 200 bills plan went viral with 70K views, share it hereIndia removed 500 & 1000 Rupee bills in 2016In November 2016, the Indian government made a similar decision to the one Israel is now considering, by withdrawing 500 and 1000 Rupee notes from circulation. In the aftermath of this decision, hundreds of people lost their lives, many more faced hardship, and the country's GDP took a significant hit.

From this 2016 article on Vox:“Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets of cities throughout India to protest an economic policy you probably haven’t heard of before: demonetization.Three weeks ago, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi surprised his country with an announcement banning 500- and 1,000-rupee notes — worth about $7 and $15 respectively — in a bid to tackle corruption and terrorism.He estimated that forcing people to exchange the country’s largest currency bills for new banknotes would allow the government to crack down on “black money” — unaccounted-for cash holdings that haven’t been taxed but, under the law, should be. He also argued that it would strike at domestic terrorist financing operations by capturing counterfeit money and rendering the legitimate cash they kept in the shadows worthless.Banning widely used banknotes would have a huge impact on any economy, but in India the policy is transformative. Modi’s sudden ban instantly meant that 86 percent of all the cash in circulation in India was no longer considered legal tender, which means that businesses could refuse to accept those bills as a form of payment. And the Indian economy simply runs on cash: It’s estimated that between 90 and 98 percent of all transactions in India, measured in terms of volume, involve it.Unsurprisingly, Modi’s demonetization initiative has caused chaos across the country. People want new banknotes, but the current supply of them isn’t close to meeting demand. That’s created headaches for people as they wait in long lines outside ATMs and banks, which routinely run out of cash. For people who rely on daily cash earnings to survive, it can mean not being able to obtain food.”In this excellent lecture by Andreas Antonopoulos, a famous Bitcoin developer and lecturer, dating back to 2016, Andreas discusses the currency war of countries. He details the cash crisis in India and other examples of countries where citizens are punished due to failed currencies (Venezuela, Argentina, Ukraine, Turkey and more).All of these trials conducted in one country, serve as testing grounds for future implementations elsewhere (such as the 2012 bank deposit confiscations in Cyprus or efforts to protect banks from collapse in the U.S. over the years). As debt continues to rise, the economic situation deteriorates, and inflation worsens, these experiments will only speed up. We can expect more taxes, further restrictions on cash, more confiscations, and rising prices alongside inflation. Eventually, this deteriorating state will provide a sufficient justification to introduce a new digital control system known as the CBDC, if another “crisis” or “emergency” doesn’t precede it.Additional cash restrictions in IsraelIsrael’s government has been tightening its policy on cash usage in recent years; Today, there are still no official restrictions on the amount of cash that can be kept at home, but the government has repeatedly emphasized that it does not view this practice favorably and prefers that as many transactions as possible be conducted through non-cash payment and money management methods. At the same time, the government is working to advance legislation that would make it illegal to hold more than 200,000 shekels in cash. Additionally, holding cash amounts of 50,000 shekels or more would require providing explanations to the authorities about the source of the money and its intended use.In August 2022, Israel announced it forbids cash purchases larger than 6,000 shekels. This reform aims, according to a statement issued by Israel’s Tax Authority, to fight organized crime, money laundering and tax non-compliance.The Jerusalem Post reported back in 2022:Under the new law, any payment to a business above 6,000 NIS ($1,700) must be made using alternative methods, such as a digital transfer or a debit card. Trading between private citizens who are not listed as business owners will be limited to 15,000 NIS ($4,360) in cash. This is another step in Israel’s fight against the use of cash. Previously, cash up to the amount of 11,000 NIS ($3,200) could be used in business deals. “We want the public to reduce the use of cash money,” adv. Tamar Bracha, who is in charge of executing the law on behalf of Israel’s Tax Authority, told The Media Line. “The goal is to reduce cash fluidity in the market, mainly because crime organizations tend to rely on cash. By limiting the use of it, criminal activity is much harder to carry out.”“The goal is to reduce cash fluidity in the market, mainly because crime organizations tend to rely on cash” — Adv. Tamar Bracha, Israel’s Tax Authority, 2022Gaza’s state of cashThe cash shortage in Gaza has intensified the already dire conditions, making it even harder for people to buy essential food and supplies.In Gaza, the scarcity isn't limited to food, water, and electricity. Almost a year into the conflict, there's a severe shortage of cash. Banks have been destroyed, and frequent power outages have rendered ATMs inoperable. Reports from the region highlight how this lack of cash is worsening the daily struggle for survival, while raids by the IDF on Hamas outposts have uncovered millions of shekels and large sums of U.S. dollars stored there.

Cleaning with soap and water and returning to customers: Gaza’s worn banknote crisisAs reported on Ynet:“A shortage of fresh cash and the closure of many bank branches due to the war have forced Gaza’s residents to reuse the same banknotes for almost a year. ""With so much use, the notes become worn and decayed, and I refuse to accept them,"" says one market vendor. Meanwhile, a new profession is emerging in the strip: cleaning and refurbishing worn banknotes.The closure of numerous bank branches in Gaza since the beginning of the war has led to a severe cash shortage, forcing residents to continue using old, tattered notes. A new trade called ""note cleaning"" is emerging, where old bills are cleaned and restored for reuse, with the service costing between 2 and 5 shekels per note.Merchants, particularly in northern Gaza, warn that the only real solution to this crisis is reopening the closed banks and injecting fresh cash into the market. Otherwise, the risk of counterfeit currency spreading grows.Additionally, cash withdrawals from ATMs in Gaza come with hefty fees ranging from 10% to 20%. Before the war, there were around 20 currency exchange offices in Gaza City alone, run by Hamas or taxed by the organization. These offices traded in various currencies and converted them, alongside several informal money changers operating in market corners.”Where do we go from here?Israel going cashless is another step in tightening control and violating property rights, for its citizens and its neighbors. This “going cashless” development is added to other worrying trends in Israel such as chewing on people’s pensions, and progressing Israel’s CBDC, the Digital Shekel.A new economic reality is ahead of us. In such times, learning about Bitcoin becomes a necessity, in order to hedge against government tyranny with the only truly decentralized, secure cryptocurrency which is controlled by no one, and is fully permissionless, outside of government control.This is a guest post by Efrat Fenigson.

Bitcoin Magazine,Building LNbits — the WordPress for Your Bitcoin Lightning Node — With Ben Arc,"Tue, 24 Sep 2024 16:46:51 GMT",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/building-lnbits-the-wordpress-for-your-bitcoin-lightning-node-with-ben-arc,Ben Arc and the talented team of developers behind LNbits are helping users do more with Lightning.,"Company Name: LNbitsFounders: Ben ArcDate Founded: Project: 2019 | Company: 2022Location of Headquarters: Fully remote (most developers based in Europe)Amount of Bitcoin Held in Treasury: N/ANumber of Employees: 6 (+ “a couple dozen other developers”)Website: https://lnbits.com/Public or Private? PrivateFive years ago, Ben Arc first had the vision for LNbits — free and open-source software that works with any Lightning Network funding source and offers a suite of extensions for both personal and business use cases.The vision for the project came to him in what he describes as a flash of inspiration.“Christian Russo, the developer of the RaspiBlitz, had come down to visit and I remember sitting in a little wash cottage where he was staying, and I just sat on the sofa and I kept going, ‘LNbits, LNbits, LNbits,’” Arc told Bitcoin Magazine. “And then I was like, ‘I think I'm going to make this project where it can be set on top of any funding source and you'll get this common API and then have some wallets and stuff.’”Soon after, Arc, a Bitcoiner based in Wales, began working on the first LNbits project, a point of sale (PoS) extension for his friend Jörg Platzer, owner of the now defunct Berlin-based Bitcoin bar Room 77.“We managed to get the PoS in the bar, and Jörg was amazed how well it worked,” recounted Arc.“What he really wanted was like an accountancy layer from which you could export CSV and then import it into different wallets, so you could have different PoSs and they’d have different wallets. None of that stuff was possible in the node implementations at the time,” he added.“So, we needed to build that for Jörg, and then I needed to build something so I didn’t have to keep replicating work when it came to creating different versions of projects.”That something was LNbits.The LNbits Developer Team FormsIn the years that followed, some of the brightest developers in the Bitcoin and Lightning space gravitated to LNbits, making contributions that would help put the project on the map.These developers included Calle, creator of Cashu; fiatjaf, creator of Nostr; Pavol Rusnak, co-founder of Satoshi Labs and a host of other notable names and pseudonyms including but not limited to dni, Eneko, Vlad Stan, supertestnet and Black Coffee. (Arc also shared that the initial design for Nostr “partly came out of LNbits” and that Cashu “was an LNbits project for such a long time.”)This makes the LNbits developer team the Wu-Tang Clan of Bitcoin and Lightning developers — an über-talented supergroup whose members do groundbreaking work both together and on their own.And if the LNbits developer team is Wu-Tang, then Arc is the RZA, the head of the group who organizes things and helps set up business deals. That said, the LNbits team came together less because of a master plan by Arc and more out of practicality.“LNbits came out of necessity because a lot of us were replicating work,” said Arc. “A lot of us were having to make all these different versions of our projects for all these different node implementations,” he added, making the point that the primary motivation behind LNbits was to reduce redundancy.The team really came together when Arc learned that major entities in the space were beginning to use the software. At an Adopting Bitcoin conference in El Salvador, Arc bumped into some of the members of the team from IBEX, who mentioned that they were using LNbits.“They said, ‘We love our LNbits. We're using it for our products in our bank,’” recalled Arc.“And I was like, ‘Well, it was really buggy beta software. Please don't use it in your bank,” he added with a laugh.“At that point, everyone who was working on LNBits was like, ‘Okay, wow, people are using this thing. I think we now need to make a more stable version that people can use and access, particularly if they're putting it in their software stacks.’”Setting Up LNbits, The CompanyArc’s interaction with the IBEX team made him realize that the time had come to turn LNbits into a proper business.“We had to set up a company, which could then pay developers to work on LNbits,” said Arc.Arc paralleled the relationship between LNbits the open-source software and LNbits the company to WordPress.org and WordPress.com. WordPress.org is the company that manages and develops WordPress.com, which is open-source software.LNbits and WordPress are also similar in that anyone can develop extensions that give WordPress-powered websites extra functionality just as anyone can develop extensions for LNbits.While it’s easy to incentivize development in LNbits’ extension marketplace by allowing developers to charge for the extension they create, getting developers to work on the software itself is more difficult. Hence, Arc set up the company.“By setting up the company, we have some funds to put into the development work, which isn't so glamorous, isn't so fun,” said Arc of how LNbits approaches its software development.“You're less likely to kind of get people doing that on a free and open source project.”Funding LNbitsArc initially had some trepidation about telling the LNbits developer team that he was going to be setting up the business, though he was pleasantly surprised by their reaction when he shared the news.“I was very nervous with our free and open source community to break the news to them that we were going to set up a business to help fund development and stuff,” said Arc. “But when we told them, they were all super excited about it.”LNbits has since raised approximately $500k, and is now raising a $1 million seed round, an amount and an arrangement with which Arc is comfortable.“I really like private capital when it's beholden to a free and open source project,” said Arc.He went on to describe how LNbits would have had to have raised between $10 and $20 million if it had built LNbits as a proprietary piece of software. Building it organically has been far cheaper, and building with the Bitcoin community in mind all along has had benefits, as well.“To have this piece of software and then also have this community, which you're kind of beholden to, stops you from making bad decisions,” explained Arc.Coming Out Of BetaWhile LNbits has become more widely used over the last five years, it’s remained in beta all the while. Arc has been in no rush to officially release a product that he didn’t feel was stable enough.“In Bitcoin, a lot of projects come out of beta too early,” explained Arc.“It's just kind of a sad and scary reality that they want people to trust the software which they've developed, but we didn't want to do that. We really wanted to be very conservative,” he added.In preparation to release version one, LNbits has incorporated some funding and swapping services.“In the last release, we added PhoenixD as a funding source for LNbits,” began Arc, describing the server equivalent of the Phoenix Wallet for mobile.“We added the Breez SDK. We're using the Boltz swapping service for trustless Atomic Swaps in and out of Liquid. So, it means you can actually fund your LNbits with a Liquid Wallet, which absolutely blows my brain,” he added.The Future of LNbitsRight now, Arc seems to simply be focused on getting version one live and then continuing to fine tune it so that people and businesses can rely on it in a professional capacity. Arc wants to be sure the team is focused so that it can “debug on the fly” if and when necessary.Arc and the LNbits team also want to create more educational content around showing people how to use LNbits as well as how to create their own LNbits extensions.“That was a success of the project early on,” said Arc. “We just did a lot of educational content and everyone was like, ‘Okay, cool, I can try and build something on this thing.”While Arc also seems excited about how LNbits can further integrate with Nostr (he’s been toying around with running the Internet of Things (IoT) over Nostr), the most exciting part about the future for LNbits is its limitlessness.Put another way, in just five years, it has attracted brilliant developers who’ve created the earliest iterations of their revolutionary technologies (e.g., Cashu, Nostr) via LNbits, and this isn’t to mention all of the innovative LNbits extensions developers have created.The question now is who develops via LNbits in the next five years and what do they create?While Arc doesn’t claim to know, he is surely excited about what comes next, especially in the wake of version one going live.“Once we're version one, that's when the real fun begins,” said Arc. “We're starting to see glimpses of it, because we can just build fun extensions for functionality and build out product services,” he added.“That really is when the fun begins for the project.”"

In a memo, Hougan described a telling moment at a recent financial advisor summit hosted by Barron's magazine. When asked, nearly every attendee said they owned Bitcoin and crypto assets personally.Bitwise is a major Bitcoin and crypto index fund provider managing over $4.5 billion in assets. Earlier this year, the company secured regulatory approval for the first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S.Hougan said when he asked the same question at past advisor summits, only 10-20% would raise their hands. Approximately 70% said they owned Bitcoin and crypto this year, representing a sea change.While fewer said they had allocated Bitcoin and crypto in client accounts yet, Hougan expects that to follow within 6-12 months based on past trends. He called it ""one of the most powerful signs of the times"" that top financial advisors are buying Bitcoin and crypto themselves.Hougan believes the launch of Bitcoin ETFs this year, which opened Bitcoin access to more investors, sparked the shift. But he says when advisors buy Bitcoin personally, it breeds familiarity and opens the path to later client allocations.The anecdote reveals surging Bitcoin ownership among influential finance professionals firsthand. As these elite advisors and money managers embrace Bitcoin, it validates and likely foreshadows a larger wave of institutional adoption."
Crypto Potato,Bitcoin Price to Recover Soon? This Popular Indicator Gives Hints,"Sat, 05 Oct 2024 01:35:27 +0000",https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-to-recover-soon-this-popular-indicator-gives-hints/,"A golden cross in the Coinbase Premium Index suggests a short-term Bitcoin price increase, with US demand on the rise.","The crypto market tumbled significantly as geopolitical tensions escalated after Iran launched missile strikes on Israel. Bitcoin, for one, dropped below $60,500 before staging a modest recovery.
Despite this, demand from United States-based investors remains high, according to recent findings. Such a trend could provide Bitcoin with a respite from the bears.
US Investor Demand Remains Strong
In an October 3 post, CryptoQuant noted the chance of a short-term Bitcoin price increase.
The Coinbase Premium Index signals a potential short-term increase in Bitcoin’s price. By tracking the 1-hour time frame and comparing the 24-hour and 168-hour moving averages, CryptoQuant analyst Yonsei_dent found that a bullish indicator has emerged when the daily moving average forms a golden cross over the weekly.
At present, the daily average has temporarily surpassed the weekly average, with the gap between the two narrowing, suggesting upward momentum. Historically, this pattern has led to short-term price increases, as seen on October 1st, when strong US investor demand pushed Bitcoin higher despite a correction.
The current rise in Coinbase Premium indicates a similar scenario, with growing demand from US-based investors potentially indicating a recovery in Bitcoin’s price.
Source: CryptoQuant
Bitcoin Sees Record Outflows from Exchanges
Adding to this bullish thesis, another analysis by CryptoQuant revealed that Bitcoin has experienced its largest outflow from exchanges since November 2022, signaling a shift in market sentiment.
On-chain data shows a marked increase in outflows, with the 30-, 50-, and 100-day moving averages all reflecting this trend. A significant outflow typically indicates that investors are moving their Bitcoin to private wallets, reducing the supply on exchanges, which can create much-needed upward pressure on the price of the asset.
This trend often suggests that investors are confident in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, opting to hold rather than trade, which may be a bullish indicator for future market activity.

CryptoQuant analysts say this year will be no different; however, things are not adding up.
According to a CryptoQuant report, Bitcoin’s apparent demand growth is still slow, and it will need to grow at faster rates to propel and sustain price rises in Q4.
BTC Demand Needs to Pick-up
Seasonal performances seen in 2012, 2016, and 2020, which are all halving years, recorded increases of 9%, 59%, and 171%, respectively, for the price of BTC. So far in 2024, bitcoin’s performance has been similar to patterns seen in 2016 and 2020, indicating a high chance that the price would rally in the coming months.
The only difference between 2024 and 2020 is that BTC entered Q4 hovering between the bull and bear phases this year, while the asset entered Q4 2020 in a clear bull phase. The CryptoQuant Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator tracked this movement, signaling that BTC had been hovering between the bull and bear phases for the past three weeks.
Demand needs to grow for BTC to remain steady in the bull phase. Based on past trends, analysts expect it to resume, possibly leading to an increase in short-term supply. The launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier in 2024 caused a spike in supply, which reflected high demand as long-term holders sold to new buyers.
Currently, Bitcoin’s apparent demand growth appears muted, and it has been so since July, oscillating between -23,000 and +69,000 BTC monthly. This metric grew by 496,000 BTC in April when the asset was hovering at $70,000; hence, there is a lot of room for growth in Q4.
BTC Targets $85K to $100K
Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States are already showing signs of increasing demand. They moved from net selling 5,000 BTC in early September to buying roughly 7,000 BTC by the end of the month. Analysts said this is the highest daily purchase since July 21.
Meanwhile, on-chain data valuation metrics suggest BTC could rally to $85,000 or $100,000 once prices pick up in Q4. Analysts called these target prices the upper and maximum levels of traders’ on-chain realized bands.

The discussions, held in Washington, focused on measures to enhance economic governance and bolster public finances.
In a press briefing on Oct. 3, Kozack emphasized that the IMF’s main recommendation is a “narrowing of the scope of the Bitcoin law, strengthening the regulatory framework and oversight of the Bitcoin ecosystem.”
The IMF has voiced concerns regarding the potential risks posed by Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador, a key topic in negotiations on the country’s new lending program. The discussions aim to create a framework of policies that could aid in boosting productivity and strengthening economic reforms.
Kozack added:
“Addressing risks arising from Bitcoin is a key element of these discussions.”
El Salvador made headlines in 2021 as the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, a move that has spurred mixed reactions. While the country’s economy has seen positive growth, including a GDP increase of over 10% and a significant reduction in crime rates, the IMF continues to express reservations about the financial risks tied to Bitcoin’s volatility.
The IMF’s concerns coincide with El Salvador’s newly presented 2025 budget proposal, which Kozack described as “a step in strengthening public finances.” The proposal includes measures to control the nation’s budget, focusing on spending and implementing reforms to improve governance.
Despite El Salvador’s achievements, including a 95% decrease in the murder rate and a 95% boost in tourism in 2023, some international institutions remain cautious about Bitcoin’s long-term impacts on the country’s financial stability.
Supporters of the Bitcoin experiment, including prominent figures such as President Nayib Bukele, have defended the initiative, citing significant economic improvements since its adoption.
VanEck’s head of digital assets research, Mathew Sigel, criticized the IMF for “holding El Salvador hostage over Bitcoin.” He further highlighted several notable achievements since the country adopted Bitcoin, including El Salvador’s GDP growth, declining crime rate, and booming tourism.
Sigel praised President Nayib Bukele for driving what he called a “remarkable transformation,” urging the president to “stand firm” in his vision for the country.
While the government remains firm in its commitment to Bitcoin, the IMF has insisted that any future lending program must address these risks, signaling that El Salvador’s approach to crypto will remain a central focus of its discussions with the international lender.

The company’s crypto futures ETFs — including the Bitwise Bitcoin Strategy Optimum Roll ETF (BITC), the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH), and the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP) — will be rebranded to the Bitwise Trendwise Bitcoin and Treasuries Rotation Strategy ETF (BITC), the Bitwise Trendwise Ethereum and Treasuries Rotation Strategy ETF (AETH), and the Bitwise Trendwise BTC/ETH and Treasuries Rotation Strategy ETF (BTOP), respectively.
The fund manager expects the adjustment to occur by Dec. 3.
Notably, this move comes during the same week that the asset manager applied to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot XRP ETF.
Bitwise Trendwise ETFs
According to the statement, these ETFs will adjust their exposure to crypto or US Treasuries, depending on market conditions. During positive market trends, they will focus on crypto investments, while during downturns, they will shift to US Treasuries.
Bitwise explained that the Trendwise strategy improves risk-adjusted returns by taking advantage of market momentum while offering protection during bearish conditions. The strategy relies on a proprietary signal that monitors the 10- and 20-day exponential moving averages (EMA) of crypto prices.
So, when the 10-day EMA surpasses the 20-day EMA—signaling upward momentum—the funds will invest in crypto. If the situation reverses, the funds will rotate into US Treasuries.
Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan explained that this strategy reflects broader trends in asset management. He stated:
“The new Trendwise strategies capitalize on that momentum through a trend-following strategy that rotates between crypto and Treasuries exposure based on market direction. The goal is to help minimize downside volatility and potentially improve risk-adjusted returns.”
Meanwhile, Bitcoin market analyst Joe Consorti praised the development, stating:
“This is massive news for bitcoin as a macro asset. US Treasuries are the preferred asset for all of the world’s financial institutions. Adding bitcoin to a rotating investment vehicle will juice UST returns and be an enticing diversifier for UST-heavy balance sheets.”
These changes will not impact the funds’ expense ratios or tax treatment, so current investors will not need to take any action.

According to the firm’s September recap report, Bitcoin surged 7.7% over the month, buoyed by the Federal Reserve’s rate cut and China’s economic stimulus. It outpaced Ethereum, which managed only a 3.2% gain over the same period.
Bitcoin and Ethereum
VanEck said that Bitcoin’s rally, which saw $1.2 billion in net inflows into US Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs), indicates growing investor confidence. These ETPs have accumulated more Bitcoin than has been mined since their launch, playing a crucial role in price formation.
In contrast, Ethereum continued to lose ground, with fee generation dropping sharply as its market share hit five-year lows. Despite the poor performance, Ethereum showed signs of stabilization mid-month, as its fee market share rebounded from 31% in August to 45% in September.
Ethereum’s shift to a settlement layer for Layer-2 blockchains, following the implementation of EIP-4844, has reduced demand for its blockspace, leading to a sharp decline in transaction revenues from $7.2 billion in March to $1.2 billion in September.
VanEck suggested that while Ethereum’s long-term strategy aims to support mass adoption, its short-term underperformance could challenge its position in the market. On the other hand, Bitcoin continues to show resilience, with institutional inflows and strong price momentum reinforcing its dominant position in the digital asset space.
Top metrics
Layer-1 blockchains dominated in September, with Sui leading the pack, surging 118% to reach a $5 billion market cap. The network also saw a significant 140% growth in daily active addresses (DAAs) and a 48% growth in revenue, driven primarily by memecoin speculation and native stablecoin activity.
Aptos also performed strongly, climbing 23%, despite a token unlock worth $90 million. The growth was largely attributed to the Raptr software upgrade, which bolstered transaction speeds and boosted daily active addresses by 30%.
Solana rounded out the top three performers after surging 14% over the period. This was fueled by the much-anticipated release of the “Firedancer” upgrade, which promises to enhance transaction throughput and network reliability. Firedancer, currently in testnet, achieved 89,000 transactions per second, a notable improvement for the Solana network.
Meanwhile, Polygon underperformed the wider market, falling by 4% amid a sharp drop in daily active users and a 50% reduction in fee generation. Despite these challenges, the network continued with its Polygon 2.0 roadmap, successfully migrating the MATIC token to POL with the goal of enhancing interoperability and scalability.
Memecoins posted a 31% gain in September, while DeFi tokens followed with a 19% increase. Layer-1 tokens as a whole rose 11%, with crypto equities gaining 11% as well.

[…]The postBitcoin’s performance as US labor market normalizes after pandemic disruptionappeared first onCryptoSlate.","The post-COVID US labor market is finally experiencing a nuanced shift, reflecting a blend of resilience and gradual normalization after the unprecedented disruptions of the pandemic. By weaving together the latest data on job quits, wage growth, unemployment, job openings, and inflation, we can create a comprehensive picture highlighting opportunities and challenges for everyday people.
Employment Trends and Labor Participation
The unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in September 2024, the lowest in three months, with 281,000 fewer people unemployed and 430,000 more employed individuals, bringing total employment to 161.864 million. This decline suggests that more people are finding jobs and that the labor market is absorbing workers at a steady pace. The labor force participation rate remains steady at 62.7%, while the employment-population ratio has increased slightly to 60.2%. While these figures indicate stability, the participation rate is still below pre-pandemic levels, suggesting that some individuals remain out of the workforce due to factors like childcare responsibilities, health concerns, or early retirements prompted by the pandemic.
Wage Growth and Purchasing Power
Average hourly earnings rose 4.0% year-over-year in September 2024, the most significant increase in four months and above market expectations. This wage growth enhances income levels for everyday workers and potentially improves living standards. Importantly, this wage increase outpaces the current inflation rate, which slowed to 2.5% in August 2024, the lowest since February 2021. The deceleration in inflation, especially with declining energy and food costs, means that real wages (adjusted for inflation) are increasing. Workers are earning more nominally and gaining greater purchasing power, allowing them to afford more goods and services than in the past.
Job Openings and Labor Market Conditions
Job openings decreased to 8.095 million in August 2024 from 8.378 million in July, signaling a cooling in employer demand for new hires. While this number is still above the historical average of around 5.4 million, the decline suggests that businesses may be becoming more cautious about expanding their workforce. Factors such as economic uncertainty, supply chain disruptions, or anticipation of lower consumer demand could influence hiring decisions. For job seekers, this may translate to fewer available positions and potentially increased competition for existing openings.
Job Quits and Worker Confidence
The job quit rate decreased to 1.90% in August 2024, falling below the historical average of 2.01% and significantly down from the all-time high of 3% in November 2021. A lower quits rate may indicate that workers are less confident in the labor market’s ability to provide alternative employment opportunities or are more content with their current jobs. This shift could be due to a perceived slowdown in economic growth or concerns about job security amid changing market conditions. For employees, this means staying put rather than seeking new opportunities, impacting career mobility and wage negotiation power.
Inflation and Cost of Living
Inflation’s continued slowdown to 2.5% benefits consumers by reducing the rate at which prices for goods and services rise. Significant decreases in energy costs, particularly gasoline and fuel oil, alleviate household financial pressure. Food and transportation inflation has also eased, contributing to a lower overall cost of living. However, shelter costs have increased, with housing inflation rising to 5.2%, which could strain budgets for renters and potential homebuyers. The balance between wage growth and inflation is crucial; with wages growing faster than inflation, workers effectively gain more financial stability.
Holistic Implications for US Citizens
For the average person, these intertwined trends suggest a labor market that is robust yet stabilizing. Employment opportunities remain available, and rising wages enhance earning potential. The slowing of inflation further amplifies the positive impact on disposable income and purchasing power. However, the decrease in job openings and the quits rate hints at a labor market that may become less favorable to job seekers in the near future. Employers may hold more leverage in wage negotiations, and job mobility could decline.
In essence, while workers currently enjoy the benefits of increased wages and lower inflation, they should remain mindful of the evolving labor market forces. Economic indicators suggest caution as the labor market shows signs of cooling from its post-pandemic surge.
We see a US labor market transitioning from the rapid changes induced by the pandemic towards a more normalized state. Declining unemployment, rising wages, decreasing job openings, and slowing inflation provide a multifaceted view of the economy, highlighting both positive developments and areas that warrant attention for everyday people.
Bitcoin’s Role in the Post-COVID Economic Landscape
In addition to traditional economic indicators, the performance of alternative assets like Bitcoin offers further insights into the current US economic landscape. Bitcoin’s price experienced a remarkable surge since the start of the pandemic, rising from $7,365 in January 2020 to $61,309 on October 4, 2024. This represents an increase of over 730%. Over the past year alone, Bitcoin’s price has grown by 123.12%, highlighting significant investor interest and activity in the crypto market.
Bitcoin’s Impact on Wealth and Investment
The substantial appreciation of Bitcoin reflects a combination of factors, including increased institutional adoption, heightened interest in digital assets, and concerns about traditional currency inflation due to expansive monetary policies during the pandemic. For everyday people, this surge has several implications:

Wealth Creation for Investors: Individuals who invested in Bitcoin before or during the early stages of the pandemic may have seen substantial returns, enhancing their financial positions and spending power. This wealth effect can contribute to increased consumer spending, stimulating economic activity.
Alternative Investment Opportunities: The strong performance of Bitcoin emphasizes a growing trend of diversifying portfolios with alternative assets. This shift indicates a changing investment landscape where cryptocurrencies are becoming more mainstream.
Inflation Hedge Perception: Bitcoin is often viewed as a hedge against inflation. With traditional inflation rates slowing to 2.5% in August 2024, the appeal of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge may influence investment strategies.

Interplay with the Labor Market and Economy
While Bitcoin’s rise is notable, its impact on the broader economy and labor market is multifaceted:

Investment Diversion: Capital flowing into Bitcoin may divert investments from traditional markets. However, this can also lead to innovation and job creation within the blockchain and fintech industries.
Job Creation in New Sectors: The growth of the crypto market has led to new employment opportunities in the technology, finance, and regulatory sectors. This can positively affect the labor market by creating jobs that require specialized skills.
Consumer Confidence and Spending: Significant gains in investments like Bitcoin can boost consumer confidence and lead to increased spending, further fueling economic growth.

Financial Considerations for Everyday People
For the average person, the surge in Bitcoin’s value presents both opportunities and risks:

Potential for High Returns: Investing in Bitcoin can offer high returns, as evidenced by its substantial growth. This can be attractive for those looking to enhance their financial portfolios.
Volatility Risks: Bitcoin is known for its price volatility. Rapid price fluctuations in the short term can lead to significant unrealized losses, making it a risky investment for those without a high-risk tolerance.
Accessibility and Education: The complexity of crypto markets requires individuals to educate themselves thoroughly before investing. Access to reliable information and an understanding of market conditions are crucial.

Integrating Bitcoin’s Performance with Economic Indicators
When we consider Bitcoin’s performance alongside traditional economic indicators, a more comprehensive picture emerges:

Wage Growth and Investment Capacity: With average hourly earnings increasing by 4.0% year-over-year in September 2024, individuals may have more disposable income to invest in assets like Bitcoin. This can lead to greater participation in the crypto market.
Inflation and Asset Value: The slowing inflation rate, now at 2.5%, coupled with rising wages, means that individuals have more real income. This scenario can encourage investment in alternative assets as people seek to diversify their portfolios.
Labor Market Forces: The decline in the unemployment rate to 4.1% and the increase in employment levels suggest a strengthening economy. A robust labor market can boost consumer confidence, potentially increasing investment in higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies.

By factoring in Bitcoin’s remarkable performance since the start of the pandemic, we observe an economy that is not only recovering in traditional terms—through employment, wages, and controlled inflation—but also evolving in how people engage with financial markets. The interplay between a strengthening labor market, rising wages, slowing inflation, and the surge in alternative investments like Bitcoin paints a complex economic portrait.
In essence, the US economy post-COVID is characterized by resilience and adaptability. Traditional economic labor market indicators show positive trends, while the rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin reflects changing attitudes toward finance and investment. For individuals, staying informed and adaptable is key to navigating this dynamic economic environment.

Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s leading cryptocurrency, has been hovering near the $62,000 mark, caught in a narrow trading range between $62,000 and $63,000.
This price action comes amid heightened market attention following the release of an HBO documentary that claims to have identified Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin.

While the documentary has sparked widespread debate, skepticism about its claims has kept market sentiment cautious. 
Despite the controversy, Bitcoin has found strong institutional support, suggesting that it could maintain stability above the key $62,000 level as the fourth quarter unfolds.
HBO Documentary Claims to Reveal Bitcoin Creator, Sparking Market Speculation
An upcoming HBO documentary directed by Cullen Hoback claims to unveil the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin. 
If validated, this revelation could significantly impact global financial markets and attract new interest in the cryptocurrency. 
The film, set to air next Wednesday at 2 a.m. CET (Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST), has already generated buzz within financial circles.

Critics question the documentary’s credibility, citing previous failed attempts to uncover Satoshi’s identity.
Some view it as a potential publicity stunt rather than a genuine revelation.
Market sentiment and Bitcoin prices could see increased volatility following the documentary’s release.

The documentary’s findings could either confirm long-standing theories or further fuel speculation about Nakamoto’s true identity and influence Bitcoin’s market performance.
Cryptocurrency Market Growth and Price Outlook for Bitcoin in Q4 2024
Moreover, the cryptocurrency market experienced significant growth in Q3 of 2024, driven primarily by rising institutional investments and the returning interest of retail investors. 
Institutional investors view cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a hedge against traditional market risks, enhancing liquidity in the market. This has led to increased investments from financial institutions, bolstering Bitcoin’s reputation as a digital store of value.

 Cryptocurrencies continue to outperform the stock market. This is reported by #CoinDesk (https://t.co/tb5oFu2rrV) citing a report from investment firm Canaccord. In the firm’s statement, it is noted that #Bitcoin ended the last quarter with a rise of approximately 140%,… pic.twitter.com/sQ7gchHjZa— Swapster (@SwapsterTeam) October 3, 2024

Meanwhile, retail investors have regained confidence, encouraged by stabilizing prices of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. User-friendly trading platforms have also made it easier for individual investors to participate in the market, contributing to higher trading volumes.
As we look toward Q4, there is optimism for more stability in the market, especially with the upcoming U.S. elections potentially reducing uncertainty. Historically, Bitcoin has shown strong performance in Q4, averaging a 90.33% price increase over the past decade, suggesting a possible surge that could lead to new all-time highs.
Therefore, the robust growth in institutional investments and retail interest, combined with Bitcoin’s established reputation as a digital store of value, is likely to drive BTC prices higher. Increased liquidity and stability in the market may lead to significant price surges, especially in Q4.

Crypto News,Bitcoin ‘Destined’ to Break Below 60K Support Amid Geopolitical Tensions: Standard Chartered,"Fri, 04 Oct 2024 15:31:45 +0000",https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-destined-to-break-below-60k-support-amid-geopolitical-tensions-standard-chartered/,"Critical Bitcoin Support at $60,000 has come under scrutiny due to geopolitical risk fears, according to Standard Chartered Head of Digital Assets Research Geoff Kendrick.The postBitcoin ‘Destined’ to Break Below 60K Support Amid Geopolitical Tensions: Standard Charteredappeared first onCryptonews.","
Critical Bitcoin Support at $60,000 has come under scrutiny due to geopolitical risk fears, according to Standard Chartered Head of Digital Assets Research Geoff Kendrick.
In a recent note, Kendrick argued that Bitcoin does not currently represent a safe-haven asset amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.
Following the crypto market’s plunge alongside stocks this week, triggered by Iran’s offensive against Israel, Kendrick stated that Bitcoin should not be viewed as a hedge against geopolitical risks.

Risk concerns related to the Middle East seem destined to push Bitcoin below $60,000.

While better-than-expected U.S. jobs data derailed Kendrick’s expectations for a break below this support “before the weekend,” the threat still remains.
However, the analyst noted this potential dip as a buying opportunity that “should be bought into,” pointing to increased activity in Bitcoin options markets and a “circularity” effect involving U.S. presidential odds as factors that could support prices.
Trump Overtakes Harris on Polymarket 
Kendrick observed that the odds in the US presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have shifted slightly this week.
According to Polymarket data, Trump’s chances of winning the election have recently recovered, overtaking Harris by 1% after a long period where Harris held the lead.

“This creates an interesting circularity for bitcoin,” Kendrick explained. “Geopolitical concerns may push prices lower, yet these very concerns seem to increase Trump’s odds, potentially improving bitcoin’s post-election outlook.”
A Trump victory is seen as favorable for cryptocurrencies, particularly given his engagement at Bitcoin 2024 and his announcements regarding a decentralized finance (DeFi) project called World Liberty. 
Analysts anticipate that Trump’s administration would accelerate progress on pro-crypto policies, with past Standard Chartered reports setting an end-of-year Bitcoin price target of $220K under a Trump presidency.
However, the report also noted the potential for a Harris presidency to push Bitcoin to a new high, with a target of $75K, especially with her recent public endorsement of digital assets.
Although Kendrick mentioned that her election might “likely trigger an initial price decline, we would expect investors to buy the dips as the market recognizes that progress on the regulatory front will still be forthcoming.”
Bitcoin Open Interest Sets Strong Medium-term Sentiment
Kendrick highlighted that recent market activity has shown a significant influx of Bitcoin call option positions. In the past two days, the amount of call option open interest for the 27 December expiry at an $80,000 strike price on Deribit jumped by 1,300 Bitcoin.
This growing demand for call options suggests that many traders are betting on upward price movements, which can contribute to a positive market outlook for Bitcoin.
The analyst cited this as further grounds for a buying opportunity, stating, “Positions like the $80k call options highlighted here and the circularity vis-à-vis Trump probabilities suggest the dip should be bought into.”
This is just one of many factors contributing to what is expected to be an explosive Q4 for Bitcoin as catalysts line up in its favour.

Crypto News,Bitcoin Price Chops After Strong US Jobs Report – Where Next for BTC?,"Fri, 04 Oct 2024 15:20:40 +0000",https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-chops-after-strong-us-jobs-report-where-next-for-btc/,"The Bitcoin (BTC) price has seen choppy trade since the release of a much stronger-than-expected US jobs report for September, initially rising from the mid-$61,000s to come within a whisker of testing $62,000 before dropping back to $61,000.The postBitcoin Price Chops After Strong US Jobs Report – Where Next for BTC?appeared first onCryptonews.","
Following the release of a stronger-than-expected US jobs report in September, the Bitcoin price has fluctuated between $61,000 and $62,000 as traders assess the economic outlook and geopolitical risks.

#US NFP September 254k vs 147k exp.Pr 142k.Unemployment rate 4.1% vs 4.2% exp/pr.Participation rate 67.7% vs 62.7% exp/pr.Wages 4.0% vs 3.8% exp/pr y/y.$USD— Forex Analytix (@forexanalytix) October 4, 2024

The US economy added 254,000 jobs in September 2024, substantially surpassing Wall Street’s expectation of 147,000. 
The unemployment rate also dropped to 4.1%, while the annual pace of wage growth increased to 4.0% from 3.8% in August.
This stronger-than-expected jobs report prompted macro traders to largely eliminate bets on another 50bps rate cut from the Federal Reserve in November. 
According to the CME Fed Watch Tool, money markets are now pricing a nearly 95% probability of a 25bps rate cut next month.

CME FEDWATCH SHOWS 90.9% FOR 25BPS CUT AT FOMC NOV 7 MEETING, SHOWS 9.1% FOR 50BPS CUT— *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) October 4, 2024

The report supports the narrative that a soft landing for the US economy is still achievable — meaning the Fed may succeed in bringing inflation under control without triggering a recession. 
While this points to a slower pace of rate cuts, substantial cuts are still expected in late 2024 and 2025.
Continued robust US economic growth, alongside a more accommodative monetary policy, could create a favorable environment for risk assets, including Bitcoin. 
Despite the optimism, the Bitcoin price remains down by about 6.6% since the beginning of the week. Is a rebound on the horizon?
What’s Next for the Bitcoin Price After the US Jobs Report?
Geopolitical tensions continue to play a significant role in shaping the Bitcoin market and broader financial markets. 
Israel is anticipated to retaliate against Iran after a missile attack earlier this week, raising fears of a broader conflict.

Everyone on X : "" Uptober is here, Q4 is very bullish""Iran to Israel : pic.twitter.com/AIUwi7G5fW— naiive (@naiivememe) October 2, 2024

Such an escalation could severely disrupt oil flows from the Middle East, posing a major risk to the global economy and keeping risk appetite in check across markets, particularly in crypto.
Without the recent geopolitical tensions, this week’s US economic data could have fueled a strong Bitcoin rally, potentially pushing the price as high as $70,000. 
However, due to the worsening geopolitical landscape, October may not see the typical “Uptober” surge that some market participants expected.
Polymarket users currently assign a 25% chance that Bitcoin reaches $70,000 this month, compared to a 42% chance it falls to $55,000.

In contrast, Standard Chartered issued a note earlier this week warning that a short-term dip below $60,000 is likely, but encouraged investors to buy the dip.

Long-Term Outlook for the Bitcoin Price
Geopolitical events often have only a short-term impact on markets such as Bitcoin and US equities. 
Longer-term drivers, like a global monetary policy easing cycle, could drive Bitcoin back to record highs later in 2024 or in 2025.
This scenario would align well with Bitcoin’s usual post-US election and delayed post-halving rally patterns. 
While October may bring volatility, Bitcoin could still approach $100,000 in the coming quarters.

Follow Tommy on X.

This interview on the Danny Jones Podcast episode 263 both felt like it was being channeled from my own brain while also hitting me with an overload of new information. It hit the spot, as someone who has long held the opinion that all modern wars and psychological operations are symptoms of easy fiat money, and that the government is simply the biggest criminal cartel that grows large enough to self-legitimize its racket and assumes the role of moral authority. Kruse postulates that the goal of globalist transhumanists is to replace the U.S. Constitution, a document that is designed to protect individuals from government, with the U.N. Charter, a document designed to usurp it and provide tyrannical power to proxies of the industrial military complex. “I would sit down with, probably, Adolf Hitler before I would sit down with Sergey Brin.”I wasn’t expecting to hear about Bitcoin when I started listening, but I was pleasantly surprised to hear him bring it up early and often, framed as a kryptonite to the transhumanists he portrays as his “mortal enemy”. “The reason why Bitcoin content gets removed is because DARPA is not interested in Bitcoin. Their energy to fuel their whole process is cheap fiat money.”Uncle Jack hits on topics like Kleiber's law, allodial wealth, DARPA, MK-ULTRA (and it’s subsequent versions), the Stanford marshmallow experiment, JFK’s assassination, sunlight medicine, SV40, cancer, COVID and the jabs, and even invisibility, somehow connecting it all subtly to Bitcoin, with a ‘fix the money, fix the world’ subtext.“There’s a pattern with the Industrial Military Complex. When they want to do something, they don’t ask for forgiveness, they don’t ask for permission either, they just do it.”The main ingredient was essentially that the Federal fiat system is a big Ponzi scheme, citing Roth IRAs and retirement funds specifically. And that there is a mortal war waged on us by The State to make sure enough of us die through cancers, wars or otherwise so that we aren’t all performing a bank run.The Industrial Military Complex is a machine that is powered by cheap money: fiat money. Kruse aligns Bitcoin as a solution to the fiat war machine, which is preaching to the choir for me, but exciting to hear on a non-Bitcoin show with a large audience like the Danny Jones Podcast.This article is a Take.

Additionally, 62% are willing to cross party lines for a candidate who supports pro-cryptocurrency policies.
Crypto Regulation and Voter Sentiment
The study also found that 85% of respondents want presidential candidates to adopt a clear position on cryptocurrency. The findings suggest that any party recognizing this could gain significant votes in the tightly contested race.
Voters also expressed concerns about the current state of crypto regulation, with 44% of respondents feeling that the Biden administration is not doing enough to support the industry. Additionally, 78% said they would support politicians who focus on protecting users from crypto-related scams.
Joe Lubin, CEO of ConsenSys and co-founder of Ethereum, addressed the study’s findings, stating, “There’s a myth that the crypto sector doesn’t want regulation, but that’s simply not true.” Lubin called for more regulatory clarity, noting that both parties need to recognize the importance of crypto as a bipartisan issue. “We’ve been operating under a cloud of uncertainty for too long,” he added.
Despite growing interest in digital assets, the study found voters confused about which U.S. regulatory body currently oversees the sector. Only 15% of respondents correctly identified the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the regulator, while just 4% pointed to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). 11 % of the respondents believed the U.S. Treasury Department is responsible, and another 11% thought the industry was self-regulating.
However, when asked which agencies understand the industry well enough to set crypto policies, 70% said the SEC, and 67% favored the CFTC.
Political Figures’ Crypto Knowledge
The study also examined public perceptions of U.S. politicians’ understanding of cryptocurrency. Former President Donald Trump was viewed as the most knowledgeable, with 53% of respondents saying he has a strong enough grasp of the sector to set appropriate policies. This was significantly higher than the 41% who rated Vice President Kamala Harris positively on the issue and the 36% who said the same for President Joe Biden.
Meanwhile, voters are calling for clearer regulations and stronger fraud and consumer protections to boost confidence in cryptocurrency, with these concerns being consistent across key battleground states.
Fraud prevention is another top concern for voters of all political affiliations, with Democrats and crypto owners pushing for greater transparency. Independents, meanwhile, prioritize clearer regulatory guidelines.
Across the board, the biggest obstacle to investing in cryptocurrency is the perceived risk. The report suggests that voters need reassurances to change their views.

Bitcoin Bulls Reappear, Push Price Above $62K
Yesterday, Bitcoin’s price was trading around $61,000 for quite a while, and the bears even managed to push it to a local low of around $60,800.
However, buyers stepped up and conquered $61K. Today, the positive sentiment seems to continue, as BTC is currently trading at around $62,250.

The price action during the past couple of days is important, and the way BTC performs in this range will be indicative of its upcoming direction.
That said, the volatility took its toll on the derivatives market. During the past 24 hours, more than $110 million worth of leveraged positions were wiped off, the majority of which ($64M) were short.
The sentiment remains neutral, which is an improvement compared to yesterday when the market was in a state of fear.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has urged El Salvador to review its Bitcoin policies and enhance its cryptocurrency regulations. In a press conference on October 3, Julie Kozack, the director of the IMF’s communications department, highlighted the collaborative efforts between IMF staff and Salvadoran officials. 
Their goal is to complete a new program supported by the IMF, which aims to stabilize the country’s economy, make necessary adjustments, and promote growth-focused reforms.
However, the IMF’s recommendation reflects ongoing concerns about the risks associated with Bitcoin as a legal tender. If the country acts on this advice, it could lead to a more stable economic environment, attracting foreign investment and fostering sustainable growth.

Conversely, ignoring these recommendations may slow the country’s economic recovery and introduce uncertainty into the cryptocurrency market. 
Ultimately, El Salvador’s response to the IMF’s guidance will play a crucial role in shaping its financial stability and could influence the future of cryptocurrency regulations across the region.
IMF Recommends Strengthening Bitcoin Risk Management 
The IMF stresses the importance of enhanced risk management concerning Bitcoin in its ongoing discussions with El Salvador. 
Julie Kozack outlined several recommendations from the IMF, including narrowing the scope of El Salvador’s Bitcoin law, bolstering regulatory oversight, and reducing the government’s exposure to Bitcoin.

JUST IN: IMF calls for El Salvador to limit #Bitcoin exposure pic.twitter.com/dV2A3RhaCj— Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) October 4, 2024

These measures are intended to mitigate the potential risks of using Bitcoin as a legal tender. By taking these steps, El Salvador can work towards creating a more secure economic framework while ensuring that its approach to cryptocurrency remains responsible and sustainable.
Kozack also mentioned that El Salvador’s budget proposal for 2025 is a positive move toward improving public finances. If implemented effectively, these changes could lead to a more stable financial environment, encouraging investment and supporting economic growth.
IMF Expresses Continued Concerns Over El Salvador’s Bitcoin Adoption
It is worth recalling that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised concerns about El Salvador’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. 
Following this move in September 2021, the IMF warned that Bitcoin’s volatility could lead to financial instability and highlighted the lack of consumer protections in cryptocurrency transactions. They also noted that such innovations might complicate future financial assistance from the IMF.
As of August 2024, while major risks had not yet occurred, the IMF continued to stress the importance of improving transparency and risk management related to Bitcoin. The agency recognized that more efforts are necessary to address potential fiscal and financial stability issues stemming from the Bitcoin initiative.
Failure to heed these warnings could result in ongoing economic challenges and reduce El Salvador’s chances of securing future international financial support. 
If the nation successfully aligns with the IMF’s recommendations, it could set a global example for integrating cryptocurrencies into national economies while maintaining financial stability.

Explore the impact on BTC.The postBitcoin Price Forecast: Russian Mining Industry Set to Overtake U.S. – How Will BTC React?appeared first onCryptonews.","
Bitcoin (BTC) has bounced back from its overnight dip, regaining traction above the $62,000 mark and briefly touching an intraday high of $62,400. 
This renewed strength aligns with a 1.61% increase in the overall cryptocurrency market cap, now at $2.15 trillion. 
One of the primary drivers behind Bitcoin’s price rise is the recent $25.59 million inflow into spot Bitcoin ETFs, led by the Bitwise ETF (BITB), which contributed $15.29 million. This pushed its historical inflow to a remarkable $2.11 billion, signalling growing investor confidence.

BREAKING: Yesterday the Spot #Bitcoin ETF saw $25 MILLION inflows pic.twitter.com/fMPESkxdYu— GOLD (@GOLD) October 5, 2024

In addition, the recent expansion of Russia’s Bitcoin mining sector, driven by new legislation, could make the country a serious competitor to the U.S. in the crypto-mining space. 
This development may attract significant investments and increase demand for Bitcoin, potentially setting BTC up for continued gains in the weeks ahead.
Russia’s Bitcoin Mining Poised for Growth Amid Regulatory Shifts and Global Competition
Russia’s bitcoin mining industry is poised for significant growth following the approval of a new mining law.
Igor Runets, CEO of Bitriver, sees this law as a game-changer, offering advantages that could help Russia catch up with the U.S. in the mining industry within two to three years. 
However, the law encourages collaboration between bitcoin miners and oil and gas companies, especially the use of petroleum gas for mining. 
Runets believes this will close the gap in mining capacity between the two countries. Russia currently uses 2.5 GW of energy for mining compared to the U.S.’s 7 GW.

Russian Bitcoin Mining Industry Could Surpass the American Industry in 2 Years  https://t.co/eL0IdQgpRX— Bitcoin.com News (@BTCTN) October 5, 2024

Runets also highlighted that U.S. political figures like Donald Trump and Kamala Harris focus on bitcoin mining because they fear losing the country’s leadership position.
Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has recognized the importance of the mining industry, particularly in Siberia, which has an energy surplus.
Consequently, the growth of Russia’s bitcoin mining industry, fueled by new regulations, could increase mining competition globally. 
This may lead to greater bitcoin supply, potentially stabilizing prices, but geopolitical factors could also introduce volatility in the market.
Institutional Demand Pushes Bitcoin ETFs Higher and Boosts Price Stability
Institutional interest in Bitcoin continues to grow, with U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs now holding nearly 4.6% of the total Bitcoin supply—valued at approximately $58 billion. 
This increase highlights the preference of institutions for regulated investment vehicles over direct crypto purchases. 
The recent success of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust has contributed significantly to this shift in sentiment, as more investors view Bitcoin as a stable asset.

JUST IN:  Spot #Bitcoin ETFs now hold almost 5% of the total supply of Bitcoin Demand is increasing, supply is decreasing  pic.twitter.com/PlKZpRnla3— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 4, 2024


Bitcoin ETFs offer transparency and security, making them attractive to institutional investors.
Regulatory support and increased ETF approvals have simplified investment for financial institutions.
Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against traditional market volatility has made it a stronger alternative to gold.

With these factors driving institutional demand, Bitcoin’s price stability and liquidity will likely improve, reinforcing its position as a legitimate asset class.
Bitcoin Gains Momentum Above $62,000; Eyes $64,100 Target
Bitcoin (BTC/USD) has gained modest traction, trading above the critical $62,000 mark after forming an ascending triangle pattern. 
The successful breakout at this level suggests the potential for further upside, targeting key resistance levels at $62,850 and $63,450. 
Immediate support is pegged at $61,200, with the next support levels at $60,500 and $60,000, respectively. If the price breaks below $62,000, we could see a strong bearish reversal.
Bitcoin News
The technical setup is further supported by the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently at $61,980. As long as prices remain above this line, the EMA reinforces the bullish sentiment. 
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 59, signaling neither overbought nor oversold conditions. Thus, it indicates room for additional gains if the buying momentum continues.
For the coming week, Bitcoin’s price action will largely depend on whether it can sustain its position above $62,000. 
A daily close above this threshold would open the door for a move toward $64,100. Conversely, if bears gain control and push prices below $62,000, expect a pullback to at least $60,500, where the 200-day EMA at $60,000 should provide substantial support.
Key Insights:

Ascending Triangle Breakout: A breakout above $62,000 signals bullish potential, targeting $64,100.
Support Levels: Immediate support is at $61,200, followed by $60,500 and $60,000.
Resistance Levels: Key resistance points to watch are $62,850, $63,450, and $64,100.

Overall, as long as Bitcoin holds above $62,000, the technical outlook remains bullish. A break below this level, however, could shift momentum in favour of the bears.

The company plans to use the funds to expand its operations at the Lake Mariner facility, including building the 20 MW CB-1 operation for hosting AI and high-performance computing (HPC) data centers. Additionally, TeraWulf also said that it is working on completing its fifth mining building, MB-5, and aims to reach a capacity of over 13 EH/s by early 2025 while improving mining efficiency to 18.2 J/TH.
TeraWulf’s Strategic Move
According to the official press release, TeraWulf is strategically preparing for the future by monetizing its interest in a power contract and ground lease set to expire in June 2027. This move is expected to allow it to focus resources on its Lake Mariner facility in New York, where it can benefit from lower power costs.
Selling its minority stake in Nautilus will also simplify its financial statements, improving clarity for shareholders. Recently, TeraWulf completed a 2 MW proof-of-concept project for AI and high-performance computing (HPC) that supports current and next-gen GPU technologies.
The company is also building a 20 MW colocation facility, CB-1, at Lake Mariner, designed to support a critical IT load of 16 MW with advanced cooling and redundancy features.
Reinvesting the proceeds from the sale will keep CB-1 on schedule to become operational in Q1 2025. A subsequent building, CB-2, is planned for completion in Q2 2025 and targets a gross capacity of 50 MW.
Commenting on the latest development, Paul Prager, Chief Executive Officer of TeraWulf, said,
“Monetizing our interest in Nautilus ahead of the 2027 expiration of the highly advantageous 2¢/kWh power contract allows us to capture a significant premium for our investment, provide significant capital to invest into our HPC/AI infrastructure, and capitalize on our favorably structured miner purchase agreement to upgrade our mining fleet at a discount to the current market price.”
TeraWulf’s Mixed Q2 2024 Results
TeraWulf’s second-quarter earnings report, released in August, showed mixed results. As reported earlier, the company mined 699 BTC, down 21% from last year, but revenue reached $35.6 million, slightly above the expected $35.4 million.
However, the company documented a loss of $0.03 per share, worse than the anticipated $0.02 loss. Additionally, mining costs surged 243% due to higher network difficulty and the effects of April’s Bitcoin halving.

Crypto Potato,"Substantial Net Outflows for Bitcoin, Ethereum Funds as Prices Tumble: Weekly ETF Recap","Sun, 06 Oct 2024 11:27:50 +0000",https://cryptopotato.com/substantial-net-outflows-for-bitcoin-ethereum-funds-as-prices-tumble-weekly-etf-recap/,October 1 was the worst day in terms of net outflows for the BTC ETFs in about a month.,"After being on a highly impressive streak of net inflows, the landscape around the 11 US spot Bitcoin ETFs changed in the past week, perhaps due to the geopolitical tension in the Middle East.
The Ethereum-based funds are also in the red on a weekly scale, while the two underlying assets’ prices crashed to local lows.
Bitcoin ETFs Break the Good Streak
CryptoPotato reported last weekend the positive streak the BTC ETFs had experienced, attracting over $1.1 billion in net inflows within the span of just five trading days. Moreover, that Friday (September 27) was the best day in terms of allocated funds since early June.
Consequently, BTC’s price soared from $62,000 to over $66,500 within the same week. However, the situation changed for the worse in the past five trading days as investors pivoted from their strategy.
Perhaps due to the escalating conflicts in the Middle East, market participants broke the eight-day positive streak on Tuesday, with total net outflows worth $242.6 million. Wednesday and Thursday were also painful for the ETFs, with $64.4 million and $54.2 million leaving them, respectively.
Although Monday and Friday registered net outflows worth $61.3 million and $25.6 million, the entire week ended in the red. Overall, $274.3 million was withdrawn from the US-based ETFs.
This harmed BTC’s price movements, as the asset tumbled from $66,000 (last Sunday) to $60,000 on Wednesday and Thursday. Despite recovering slightly to $62,000 as of now, the cryptocurrency is still more than 5% down weekly.
Ethereum ETFs in the Red, too
The spot Ethereum ETFs had a slightly different week but with the same outcome. Monday started with minor outflows of $0.8 million, while Thursday saw $48.6 million taken out. Another $3.2 million was pulled out on Thursday, while investors allocated $19.8 million in net inflows on Wednesday and $7.4 million on Friday.
This places the total weekly number at -$25.4 million for the ETH ETFs. Although the net outflows for Ethereum were a lot less than those for the Bitcoin ETFs, ETH’s price has actually declined more.
The second-largest digital asset stood close to $2,700 last Sunday, but it dumped by almost $400 mid-week to bottom out at around $2,300 on Thursday. It has recovered to $2,420 now, but it is still more than 8% down weekly.

Most alts have performed in a similar fashion since Friday, but the weekly landscape is quite painful, with several double-digit losers.
BTC Stalls at $62K
It’s safe to say that it wasn’t a good week for the primary cryptocurrency. It stood above $66,000 last Sunday but its troubles began as soon as Monday with a nosedive to $63,000. The situation worsened mid-week amid the escalating tension in the Middle East. This culminated on Wednesday and Thursday with a few price dips below the coveted $60,000 level.
Nevertheless, the bulls managed to defend that level and pushed bitcoin north. Since that multi-week low on Thursday, the cryptocurrency has regained about two grand and now stands around $62,000. Its movements during the weekend have been quite dull.
Still, bitcoin is down by more than 5% in the past week. This means that its market dominance has plunged from over $1.3 trillion to $1.225 trillion now. Its dominance over the alts, though, has increased during the same period to 54.3% on CG.

XRP, DOGE Lead on the Way Down
Ripple’s native token was frequently in the news during the week. Although it started positively with a filing for an XRP ETF, the SEC was quick to halt the enthusiasm by filing an appeal against a 2023 court decision about the secondary sales of the asset.
This had a dramatic impact on its price as it tumbled by 15% within less than a day from over $0.6 to $0.51. XRP is still down by double digits on a weekly scale, even though it has recovered slightly to $0.53.
The other notable losers on a weekly scale from the larger-cap alts include DOGE (-13.7%), ADA (-11.4%), SHIB (-11.4%), DOT (-12.4%), NEAR (-12.2%), and more.
The total crypto market cap lost over $150 billion at one point during the week but has regained some traction and is now at $2.250 trillion on CG.

The Daily Chart
The daily chart shows that the price has recently broken below the $64K level and the 200-day moving average in the same area. However, the $60K support zone has seemingly held BTC, pushing it back higher toward the 200-day moving average.
If the market gets rejected from the 200 DMA, then a further drop toward the $56K level and even the $52K level would be probable.

The 4-Hour Chart
Looking at the 4-hour chart, it is evident that the market structure has gone through a bearish shift, with a breakout below the bullish trendline a few days ago.
However, the market has seemingly created a bottom at $60K, as the RSI was also showing an oversold state. Therefore, everything now depends on whether the price will be able to break above $64K or if it will be rejected and pushed further down.

By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage)
Bitcoin Net Realized Profit and Loss (NRPL)
Bitcoin’s price has been consolidating for more than six months now, and market participants are still speculating whether the cycle top has formed or whether higher prices will be seen shortly. Analyzing the Bitcoin Net Realized Profit and Loss (NPRL) metric would be beneficial in this situation.
The metric measures the net profits or losses investors realize. Positive values are associated with net profits, and negative values show net losses.
As evident, while the market has not demonstrated a significant crash yet and has only been moving rangebound, the NRPL has already decreased to levels that were last seen when the price was around $30K, and the bull market was only beginning.
Therefore, if other factors do not drastically change, it could be concluded that BTC might be preparing for a new bullish run in the coming months.

In the digital age, financial privacy has become a pressing issue because surveillance is ingrained in all electronic transactions. Each one generates bits that can be aggregated, stored, revisited, abused, funneled and manipulated. Theoretically, 4th and 5th amendments of the U.S. Constitution provide a bulwark against 3rd party transaction interception.
But a rule written on a piece of paper is only as relevant as there is will to interpret it or enforce it. A more robust solution must come from a hard technological source. Alongside fixed scarcity to 21 million BTC, the underlying draw of Bitcoin is that its network makes transactions inviolable. 
Bitcoin mainnet achieves this through escalating confirmations. The first confirmation means that a transaction is included in the blockchain’s block. All subsequent blocks added embed the transaction further into the chain. By the sixth confirmation, a would-be attacker would have to mine 6 consecutive blocks faster than the rest of the Bitcoin mainnet combined.
At this point in time, the energy expenditure (hashrate) necessary for such a feat makes this virtually impossible. This is also the reason why Bitcoin’s proof-of-work is so integral to the underlying value of Bitcoin vs proof-of-stake that is so pushed by Greenpeace. 
The rule of 6 confirmations therefore became the de facto standard among developers, miners and exchanges. After that 6th confirmation threshold, a BTC transfer is deemed as “final settlement”, or irreversible.
But is a transaction genuinely irreversible if it is not private, therefore vulnerable to seizure by either governments or criminals? First, let’s examine what Bitcoin settlement entails.
Understanding Final Settlement in Bitcoin
Satoshi Nakamoto’s peer-to-peer money transfer system revolves around proof-of-work. Truly revolutionary, it makes it possible for a payment system to work by itself. In other words, to be trusted because it is trustless. From initiating a transaction to making the transaction irreversible, the final settlement process follows multiple steps:

When a user initiates a BTC transaction, it is broadcasted to the Bitcoin network (mainnet) and added in the mempool.
Bitcoin miners constitute the network, as they form a new block containing mempool transactions. Each such block references a prior block, forming a blockchain, and a nonce (number used once) as a 32-bit random number.
Nonce is the critical proof-of-work element as it alters the input to the cryptographic hash function. Because the latter is deterministic, by having a variable nonce, the output hash is changed.
This randomness creates a process of trial and error by which miners have to find a valid hash to add a new block to the chain and receive their compensation. 
The difficulty imposed by randomness exerts energy consumption, ensuring that miners did the work (proof-of-work). 
Other Bitcoin mainnet nodes then verify the validity of the block that included all the transactions.

As a matter of historical practice and analysis, the 6-block confirmation rule additionally secures the finality of those transactions. Due to network latency, it is possible for another miner to simultaneously find a valid block. In such a scenario of divergence, two blockchain states exist, so the longer chain is recognized by the network as valid, while the competing chain (orphan) is disregarded.
This also impedes malicious actors from reorganizing the chain in order to reverse transactions. By how much? 
According to the “Practical Settlement Bounds for Proof-of-Work Blockchains” paper by Gaži, Ren and Russell, a 6-block confirmation yields 0.48% settlement error guarantee, while assuming 10 second network latency (delay) and 10% adversarial computation power of the network.
While that percentage is exceedingly low under such harsh conditions, it is still not zero, which implies that settlement “finality” is still probabilistic. Rather, it is statistically improbable. And if that is the case, how should Bitcoin settlement be treated?
In his paper “Probabilistic Settlement Finality in Proof-of-Work Blockchains: Legal Considerations”, Hossein Nabilou at Amsterdam Law School argues that operational finality should be differentiated from legal finality.
But because “institutional mechanisms to deal with the remaining risks of settlement finality require a certain level of centralization in the PoW blockchains”, the solution would have to come from “market-driven mechanisms”. At the time in 2022, the author was pessimistic about their emergence.
The Privacy Gap in Bitcoin Transactions
Despite the aforementioned cryptographic hash function, and pioneering the very concept of “cryptocurrency”, the crypto part of Bitcoin relates to transaction integrity rather than privacy. Cryptographic hash function, combined with a nonce, makes it extremely difficult to tamper with Bitcoin settlements as it prevents double-spending attempts.
This cryptographic security is also critical to the infrastructure behind bitcoin payment processing services, which rely on the immutability of the Bitcoin network to ensure secure and accurate transaction settlements.
But by the nature of a self-contained network, Bitcoin incidentally offers pseudo anonymity. That level of privacy is instantly breached once an identity is attached to a Bitcoin address, leaving behind a digital trail. This is what eventually led to the arrest of Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, responsible for the Bitfinex exchange hack in 2016, worth around $4.5 billion in BTC.
“In a futile effort to maintain digital anonymity, the defendants laundered stolen funds through a labyrinth of cryptocurrency transactions.”
From this perspective, Bitcoin’s cryptographic hash should be understood as a digital signature (ECDSA) to verify authenticity, as all the transactions are visible on the public blockchain. Notwithstanding if financial privacy is constitutional or natural right, does that mean that Bitcoin cannot supply it?
What if one finds themselves in a tyrannical country and P2P Bitcoin transfer is the only means of receiving funds? Or more commonly, what if one simply views their personal wealth as something that is not appropriate for public consumption?
If a link between one’s Bitcoin possession and identity is established, it is not difficult to see how that would open the doors wide open to violent robberies or kidnapping by criminals.
Rightfully, Bitcoin holders view this lack of privacy as a massive liability. Fortunately, viable solutions to enforce Bitcoin’s privacy are on the horizon.
Enhancing Privacy: Technologies and Challenges
Beyond taking care to never link identity to Bitcoin address, or re-using a single address for multiple payments, how can a public blockchain provide financial privacy? 
The first answer is to upgrade Bitcoin core. This already happened when the Taproot upgrade was activated in November 2021, at block height 709,632.
As a soft fork, Taproot had large support among miners, so it was not as controversial as SegWith in 2017, which resulted in the hard fork of Bitcoin Cash. Taproot can mask multi-signature transactions, which prior to the upgrade were distinguishable from common single-signature ones.
Taproot’s Schnorr signature aggregation combines multiple signatures into a single one, making it difficult to determine all the parties involved with the transaction. This also reduces precious blockchain data, removing the bloat and removing data to analyze at the same time. 
Moreover, Taproot introduced MAST (Merklized Abstract Syntax Tree), allowing for more complex transactions with conditions:

John receives 5 BTC from Allen if house renovation work is completed within 3 days.
But John doesn’t have access to the entire 5 BTC, but only to 3 BTC as mutual understanding.
If 3 BTC are spent on renovation, but the work is not completed on time, Allen gets back his 2 BTC.

Such timelocked conditionals are made possible with Taproot’s MAST. Just like Schnorr, MAST reduced the size of this information via hash, therefore reducing the size of traceable information. If certain conditions are not met, including other parties required for signatures, this information would never be revealed.
It is easy to see how MAST could be used in betting markets, day trading powered by AI, wherein only the executed conditions are revealed on the blockchain, thus hiding bettor strategies and intentions. Similarly, MAST could be used to automate payments without intermediaries. 
Beyond the Taproot upgrade, Lightning Network is the most popular layer 2 scaling solution for Bitcoin. LN’s main purpose is to make BTC transfers at negligible fees by batching transactions off-chain, reducing payment data visible on the Bitcoin mainnet.
This could be further amplified if LN’s payment channel is done through onion routing. Unfortunately, this kind of approach is too complex for the average user, on top of the slowdown of settlements due to added network latency. In turn, this would add another uncertainty to settlement finality.
A more attractive solution to enhance Bitcoin privacy comes from Silent Payments, as a potential Bitcoin Core upgrade.  
Presently under Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 0352, Silent Payments protocol blends BTC transactions, so they can’t be distinguished. It works by a receiver having a unique one-time static address (reusable payment code or “stealth address”), generated when the sender’s wallet combines three keys.
This way, no payments would be ever linked to the same sender and transactions are unlinkable to this static address. For on-chain observers, the use of Silent Payments would not be visible or who owns the address. More importantly, the Silent Payments protocol does add data burden to existing Bitcoin protocol, making it scalable. 
Contrasted to similar privacy-oriented PayNyms (BIP47), BIP352 doesn’t require users to send fee-burdened two transactions (the first must come as notification) for a single payment. Likewise, BIP352 would not broadcast which wallets linked to a reusable payment code, while BIP47 would only obscure it.
The Path to True Final Settlement
Privacy coins like Monero (XMR) have largely dropped off the public spotlight. Once the EU proposed and enacted MiCA, it didn’t take other countries to follow suit, including Dubai. Likewise, major exchanges delisted privacy coins, from Kraken and Huobi to Binance and OKX.
In turn, users no longer have access to fiat off/on ramps, while also unable to use privacy coins in stores. This is an important lesson. Although governments cannot technically ban cryptocurrencies, they can do so quite effectively by deplatforming.
Based on these moves, it is clear that many governments view financial privacy as something outside natural human rights. Bitcoin is exempt from this because its proof-of-work network has always been transparent. But now that Bitcoin has been mainstreamed and institutionalized via Bitcoin ETFs, is it time for Bitcoin’s true final settlement – upgrading Bitcoin Core privacy beyond Taproot?
This would align with the standard perception of physical cash, as an inherently anonymous asset despite its central banking origin. Five US Senators have already introduced a bill to ban central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), indicating their preference for financial privacy.
At the end of the line, Bitcoin will have to grow to a greater market cap, becoming an indispensable commodity. And when the timing is right, it would be more costlier to deplatform it than it would be to allow its next privacy upgrade to take root.

Bitcoin is showing renewed strength, supported by a notable surge in exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, signaling growing investor confidence. After three consecutive days of outflows, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a robust rebound on Friday, attracting $25.6 million.
Bitwise’s BITB led with $15.3 million in fresh inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC, which added $13.6 million. This influx pushed total assets under management for Bitcoin ETFs to $57.7 billion, representing 4.7% of the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization.
Ethereum funds also experienced positive momentum, with spot ETFs pulling in $7.4 million, mainly driven by BlackRock’s ETHA, which secured $14.7 million. While Grayscale’s ETHE saw outflows of $8.2 million, the cumulative net total since July remains slightly negative. Despite mixed results, these inflows reflect investor optimism in a potential market rally.
The resurgence of interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs suggests that institutional investors are increasingly confident in the market’s long-term prospects. With Bitcoin ETFs nearing $18.5 billion in net inflows since January, the coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether this momentum can translate into a broader bull run for the cryptocurrency market.
Adoption of Bitcoin Cash Increases in “Bitcoin Cash City”
Over 200 retailers in Townsville, Australia, often known as “Bitcoin Cash City,” are taking Bitcoin Cash (BCH) payments, indicating a large acceptance of BCH.
 The quick and affordable transactions provided by the point-of-sale (POS) register software and the Bitcoin.com Wallet app contribute to this rise. 
Bitcoin Jason, a local supporter of BCH, attributes the apps’ increased growth to their user-friendliness and text-to-BCH feature. The merchant network has expanded to include industries like cafes, restaurants, and travel services.
Due to its low costs and quick transactions, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) may become increasingly popular, which could lead to competition with Bitcoin (BTC). 
Even while BCH is becoming increasingly involved in everyday transactions, BTC’s market dominance and reputation as “digital gold” make it a better store of value.
Grammy Award-Winning Rapper Logic’s $6 Million Bitcoin Investment:
The Grammy-nominated rapper Logic, real name Robert Bryson Hall II, gained notoriety in November 2020 when he made a $6 million Bitcoin investment. 
He received roughly 336.75 BTC at that time, when the price of Bitcoin was $17,817. Logic has made an astounding 238% return on his investment, with Bitcoin currently valued at over $60,228.

With a hilarious comment like “F*** it,YOLO” Logic announced his investment on Instagram. He was urged to take the step by Chris Zarou, his manager. 
Because of Logic’s success story, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are receiving increasing attention from prominent people and individual investors alike, indicating their potential as long-term investments. 
Prominent endorsements such as this maintain Bitcoin’s legitimacy and could encourage additional adoption, which would raise the price of BTC.
Robert Kiyosaki Warns of World War III: “Are You Prepared?”
Concerns about the potential for World War III have been expressed by Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki in response to growing global tensions. Is this the beginning of World War II? 
Kiyosaki posed this question in a recent post on X (previously Twitter) after learning that Israel had launched F-35 fighter jets to target Iran. 
Are you ready? Implying that ineffective leaders fuel these disputes, he underlined the need for more robust global leadership.

WWIIIIsrael just launched F35 to bomb Iran.Is this the start of WWIII?Are you prepared?This is what happens when we have weak leaders such as Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.As Jordan Peterson stated:  “If you think tough leaders are bad…wait til you see the damage weak…— Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) October 5, 2024

Not for the first time, Kiyosaki has warned of the potential for worldwide violence resulting from energy crises such as the one caused by the Nord Stream sabotage. He is concerned about the growing national debt of the United States, inflation, and the depreciating value of the dollar.
Bitcoin might gain as a safe-haven asset if geopolitical tensions increase. In the past, investors have resorted to decentralized assets such as Bitcoin to shield their capital from economic volatility during periods of unrest and uncertainty. 
When tensions escalate, there may be a surge in demand for and price growth for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin Price Outlook 
Bitcoin is consolidating around the $62,000 level after a brief rally. The cryptocurrency is trading in a tightening range, forming a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 2-hour chart. 
This technical setup suggests a potential breakout in either direction, depending on market momentum.

 #Bitcoin is consolidating around $62,000, forming a symmetrical triangle pattern. A breakout above $62,475 could spark bullish momentum, while a dip below $61,800 may lead to more downside. Keep an eye on key levels as market awaits economic data!  #Crypto #BTC pic.twitter.com/hFG8dxcGQ7— Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 6, 2024

A break above the immediate resistance at $62,475 could expose Bitcoin to the next resistance at $63,040, with a further upside target at $63,665. 
However, if BTC falls below the immediate support at $61,800, it could dip towards $61,210 or even $60,740.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 53, indicating neutral momentum, while the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $61,990 suggests minor support.
Overall, Bitcoin remains in a wait-and-see mode as traders look for a directional cue. The upcoming U.S. economic data releases, including the CPI and unemployment claims, may act as catalysts for a breakout.
Conclusion: A break above $62,475 will signal bullish momentum, while a drop below $61,800 could drive sharp selling pressure.
