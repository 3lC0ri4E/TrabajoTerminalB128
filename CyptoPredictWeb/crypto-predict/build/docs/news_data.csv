Bitcoin Magazine,Give Me Time,"Mon, 09 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/give-me-time,"On Bitcoin, Saturn and synchronicity. From ""The Privacy Issue""","This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine's ""The Privacy Issue"". Subscribe to receive your copy.With the Fourth Halving in the rearview mirror, it seems a perfect time to provide some on-record analysis of Bitcoin from the perspective of Number and Time, aka Crypto-K, which is the name for a methodology my friend and I have developed over the years in pursuit of a technical analysis of synchronicity — the sense that our reality is arranged according to some as yet undefined acausal ordering principle. The K stands for Kubrick, as in Stanley Kubrick, director of 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining, whose life and mysterious works of cinematic art are powerful strange attractors for synchronicity and high strangeness. It is the Monolith around which our methodology — and seemingly everything else — was built.Most reading this know that Bitcoin is an all-encompassing subject — a rabbit hole. Well, the same goes for Crypto-K, which in some respects is a study of everything, or how everything connects. And that everything includes Bitcoin. So you’re about to find out what happens when one rabbit hole intersects with another.How is Bitcoin related to Crypto-K?Both are about Time, or the problem with it. Crypto-K is about asking, “What is the meaning of Time’s Pace?” while Bitcoin is a new spin on the old saying “Time is Money”. How do we protect our MONEY from temporal entropy? On the other hand, how do we protect our TIME from monetary entropy?All of these concerns fall under the astro-alchemical rubric of Saturn, the seventh classical planet. The planet of laws, boundaries, inheritance, burdens: “the labor of existence, the harvest of time” (Tarnas). Here’s astrologer John Hughes, writing about Saturn: “It is the planet of real worth, as apart from show and make-believe, and gives to all things their permanent and lasting qualities. Its action is slow, thorough and inevitable.” This sounds a lot like the BTC timechain: slow, thorough, and inevitable, defined by its permanence and lasting qualities. Real worth — the labor of existence, the harvest of time, or, in other words, proof of work.Yes, Satoshi, Bitcoin is Saturnine, all right. Saturn has a peculiar history when viewed through the lens of fringe theory. In 1980 David Talbott published a book called The Saturn Myth which posited the idea that long ago a previous solar system arrangement had Saturn as the Earth’s primary star, before some terrible calamity occurred that threw everything out of whack. Maybe Talbott’s theory is whack, but there’s also Richard Hoagland (the “Face on Mars” guy), who has presented theories about Saturn, particularly its moon Iapetus, which he speculated might be an artificial body inhabited by extraterrestrials. It’s possible he regurgitated this from Arthur C. Clarke in the novelized version of 2001: A Space Odyssey, where in that book the climactic Monolith is found buried on Iapetus (not floating by Jupiter as in the film). But forget all that: Even the straight astronomers and scientists, for whom microbes in the dirt would be tremendously exciting, seem to think that Saturn (or rather, one of its moons) is the place to look when it comes to possible life within our solar system.The point is that your reality tunnel doesn’t matter: Saturn tends to dominate the frame. As the seventh and slowest-moving classical planet, it came to represent the outer limits of material reality itself. As such it was the secret destination of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey. The story goes that the special effects team had trouble creating a realistic Saturn, so they pivoted to Jupiter instead. It’s also the secret meaning of the title of Kubrick’s follow-up, A Clockwork Orange. The traditional read on that title is negative, meaning what a human being would become if he lost the ability to choose good over evil — something organic turned false and machine-like, a clockwork orange. It’s a hypothetical state of the human being denigrated under 21st-century pharmacracy. Bitcoin flips this script: What if something which began as a meaningless Saturnine process grew into a truth-affirming juggernaut imbued with analog richness but beyond the reach of any seething sovereign?Forget “A”. Bitcoin is the clockwork orange. But why orange?Bitcoin became the “orange coin” when the logo was finalized by anonymous BTC-talk user “bitboy” on 11/1/10, or the day after the second anniversary of Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin white paper. He had taken Satoshi’s original idea and cleaned it up, added a 14% twist, and decided to make the whole thing orange. Everyone agreed it was a perfect choice and it has remained in place ever since. The perfect choice of logo met with a perfect release date too, because that date can be reduced to 11110, as in the 1963 executive order issued by President Kennedy to issue silver certificates from the Treasury (occasionally cited by anti-Fed types as the reason JFK was assassinated). Here’s what we call a good old-fashioned sync. It’s possible that bitboy (whoever he was) released the logo on this day intentionally because he recognized the historical pun it would make, but more likely it just kind of happened that way as a grand micro-expression of that general acausal ordering principle mentioned above. It has a pointed sense of humor at times.Satoshi Nakamoto published the white paper on 10/31/2008 — in other words on Halloween. It’s possible that bitboy had Halloween on his mind when he decided on orange for the logo and released it two years later. Satoshi’s original logo was gold, but that crystallized into orange, perhaps as a way to give Bitcoin its own identity apart from the “shiny rock”. But it was an appropriate move to make from an alchemical perspective. In an essay from The Sync Book Vol. 2 called “Moon in the Middle”, writer Mark LeClair offers a gnostic interpretation of reality (and the color orange) based on a run of 7s: the 7 tones of the diatonic scale, the 7 days of the Gregorian week, and the 7 colors of the rainbow, which all come together to communicate the essential truth of Creation: The Moon is actually the center of everything, the crucified Christ holding reality together. According to LeClair, each day of the week and color correspond to a different planet and stage of the gnostic creation myth. The story begins with the color red and Venus on Friday, then continues to Saturday and Saturn, and of course, the next color on the spectrum, orange. “The color orange is associated with deceit and mistrust, pridefulness and passive assertiveness—a tiger, brimming with orange rage, striped and softly panting, glowering, lurking in the thickness of ferns, ready to pounce and consume the soul from the inside out. The color of gold is also a function of orange, and not of yellow as is the common misconception. Gold is the achievement of royalty and godhead through the act of alchemy, which is a process of Saturn.”As Ideal Money, true digital gold, the “orange coin” is an achievement in alchemy. The crowning achievement, perhaps, of “Cronos, the designer of Time, the Clockwork Orange… he is tough and resourceful, smart, too dangerous to dismiss as a mere force of blunt or banal evil… Feed him. Give the devil his due. Milk and cookies on the counter should do the trick.” This imposition to feed the beast might not be unlike the way Bitcoin must be “fed” with more and more electricity to power the global “macro-chip”. Not to compare Bitcoin to the devil or anything, but Satoshi did publish the white paper on All Hallow’s Eve — and wouldn’t you know it, the BTC timechain had been cranking away for exactly 666 days on Halloween 2010, aka the day before the famous orange logo was published.But there’s another, more spectacular way of connecting Bitcoin to 666 with the calendar. Satoshi gave the public a birth date for himself when he registered with the P2P Foundation: 4/5/1975, also known as the 42nd anniversary of FDR’s EO6102 that unilaterally confiscated U.S. citizen’s private gold holdings. In the late 1980s, there was an issue of The Economist featuring the headline, “Get ready for a world currency” backed by a “Golden Eagle” atop a pile of flaming fiat money (an image much loved by conspiracy theorists over the years). The cover date for this issue was 1/9/1988.This means that Satoshi Nakamoto was exactly 666 weeks old on the day of The Economist’s “world currency” issue. The magazine came well before Bitcoin ever existed. Did Satoshi know this when he “chose” his birth date?Does it seem a little threatening to you? Consider the following facts. There are 7 days in one week. This means that in 6 weeks there are 42 days. This means that in 666 weeks there are 42×111 days. Now, 666 is supposed to be a bad number right? But 42 is kind of a funny, happy number, right? So don’t think of Satoshi being 666 weeks old on the day of The Economist’s world currency issue, but instead that he was 4,242 + 420 days old! See, The Book of Revelation designates 666 as the “number of the Beast”. But notice how something as ordinary as the clockface secretly communicates it right in front of you all the time: three overlapping hands — 60 seconds, 60 minutes, 24 (6) hours. The number of the Beast is the number of the Clock. 666 is the Fourth Seal of Crypto-K. The Beast is time, ruled by Saturn. Nothing to be afraid of, though, especially now that we have Bitcoin.In pursuit of the analysis of synchronicity, we employ what we call the parent-thesis, a dialectical configuration where two points in time (“parents”) generate a third (the “child”) via the exact midpoint between them. Whether it be the midpoint of a person’s life’s or the midpoint between two deaths or two movie releases, it creates a static synchronicity that can be studied and, perhaps, classified. In the case of the birth of Satoshi Nakamoto and the cover date of The Economist world currency issue, the two dates 666 weeks apart generate a midpoint 333 weeks either way of 8/22/1981 — and this happens to be the day that NASA’s Voyager 2 probe made its approach to Iapetus, kicking off its encounter with Saturn. This fly-by first clued astronomers into the existence of the equatorial ridge on Iapetus, which now ranks as the third tallest mountain structure in the entire solar system.In keeping with the theme, 8/22/1981 also saw the release of a horror B movie called Evilspeak in which Ron Howard’s brother Clint Howard plays a nerd named Stanley Coopersmith (= 237, standard gematria), who stumbles onto the laboratory of a sixteenth-century warlock in the basement of his military academy, then uses his computer skills to summon the Devil in order to enact revenge on the kids who bully him. The opening scene has the bullies calling him “Stanley Cooperdick”, making the Stanley Kubrick comparisons even more obvious. Here we have a Stanley using computer technology to interface with Satan (a kind of artificial intelligence), and commandeering it to do his bidding — in a film released on the day Voyager 2 begins its encounter with Saturn and photographs the moon Iapetus (we’re told) — and on the mid-point of the 666 weeks between Satoshi’s birthday and The Economist’s “get ready for a world currency” issue. As the “clockwork orange”, Bitcoin could be seen metaphorically as a new form of artificial life, a new element “conjured” with computers — a decentralized phoenix rising from the ashes of centralization: Satoshi Nakamoto.It’s in Douglas Adams’ Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy that a powerful artificial intelligence in the future is built to answer the question of “life, the universe, and everything”, and comes back after millions of years of processing with the answer 42 — which we call the First Seal of Crypto-K. Satoshi loved 42 and originally wanted the total supply of Bitcoin to be 42 million, but cut it to 21 for economic reasons — then there’s the halving every 210,000 blocks (that’s two halvings per 420,000 blocks). Whether he meant to or not, Satoshi first announced his creation to the P2P Foundation forum on the 42nd day of 2009.Then there’s also the difficulty adjustment — which some say is Satoshi’s stroke of genius — every 2,016 blocks. Satoshi could have made the adjustment every 2,100 blocks, mirroring the supply cap and halving schedule. Instead, he chose 2,016, a number that was 42 + 42 less than 2,100. There is a mundane explanation for this and then there are several more exciting explanations for this. Was it because 2016 is 6102 — the number of FDR’s gold confiscation order, issued 42 years before Satoshi’s birthday — backward? It could have been because 2016 reduces to 216 which is 6 x 6 x 6 and kabbalistically significant. Or it might simply have been because this made for a difficulty adjustment every 14 days instead of every 14.58333 days. It’s all of the above: Satoshi was carefully synchronizing his creation with the clock and the calendar, i.e., with the movement of the heavens. Thus it naturally fell into the prescribed order of time’s pace, which it is the purview of Crypto-K to analyze and unwind.Of course, there’s always another sync, and always another opportunity to misinterpret the sync as evidence of conspiracy. Because events occurred in the year 2016 that are indelibly stitched into the timechain of history and retroactively make Satoshi’s choice somewhat conspicuous. Chiefly, it’s 11/9/2016, the election of Donald Trump — the orange man — for U.S. President. But on the inverse date, 9/11/2016, Hillary Clinton appeared to collapse and was tossed like a side of beef into a van that then sped away. It was interpreted by some at the time to have been the effects wrought by 4chan autists and meme-pirates unintentionally invoking an ancient Egyptian frog deity called “Kek”. This then sparked an influential online movement with a food-related name we won’t even mention that subsequently morphed into (or was co-opted by) the Q operation that officially began a year later. Did Satoshi have foreknowledge of the year in which The Plan™ was to begin and encode it into Bitcoin? Probably not, but it was encoded there nonetheless.Another more salient example of “2016” encoding has to do with the late JFK Jr., who died in a plane crash with his wife on 7/16/1999 — the day on which Stanley Kubrick’s posthumous film Eyes Wide Shut was contractually obligated to be released. JFK Jr.’s death figures heavily into the lore of some Q-adjacent conspiracy merchants, who have lately deployed the narrative that, with his friend Donald Trump’s help, JFK Jr. actually faked his death in 1999 and is set to return when the time is right. Oh boy, where have we ever heard that one before? But that’s not to say there isn’t legit weirdness there, because here’s my point: John-John was born on 11/25/1960 and died on 7/16/1999, which means that his entire life lasted for exactly 2,016 weeks.If you make John-John’s 2,016-week lifespan a parent-thesis and divide it to find the midpoint, exactly 1,008 weeks into his life was 3/21/1980, the day the TV show Dallas aired its season 3 finale, “A House Divided”, which featured the cliff-hanger death by gunshot of the show’s star J.R. Ewing — one of the most iconic moments in TV history. “Who shot JR on Dallas?” became the question on TV in 1980 in the way that “Who shot JFK in Dallas?” became the question of 1963 — and JFK Jr.’s death occurred such that this episode — a cheeky re-enactment of the Father’s death — aired on the midpoint of the life of the Son.*If* JFK Jr. faked his death, he apparently did so in such a way that his official fake lifespan silently communicated the future year in which his friend would be elected president, and also pointed to a TV episode referencing his Father’s death. Why the hell would anyone do that, though? Forget the clickbait conspiracy slop. JFK Jr. is dead as a doornail, and more and more it feels like nobody is choosing to do any of this stuff consciously. Again, we are looking at the acausal ordering principle that Carl Gustav Jung discussed in his book Synchronicity — or something along the lines of VALIS, put forth by Philip K. Dick in the wake of his revelatory experiences/temporal lobe seizure which he codenamed 2-3-74. Apparently, different people and events are or can be products of the same underlying operating principle, i.e., VALIS, the salvific entity that is here transforming our world and using us as its implements in doing so.Orange man, meet orange coin. Is it a match made in heaven? Not so far, though recently the man has softened his tune on the coin after basically denouncing it during his presidency. Here’s what you didn’t know: The orange man’s presidency was inaugurated on 1/20/2017, which was exactly 420 weeks after the orange coin was inaugurated in the Genesis block on 1/3/2009. It would seem that there might be something deeper connecting these two than just the color — after all, Trump isn’t really orange just like Bitcoin isn’t really orange either. In both cases, it’s the brand. Trump’s critics (and his fans) have often remarked how he could shoot someone in broad daylight and get away with it — a hyperbole to emphasize how he resists or repels criticism. In other words, he can survive anything, and can usually spin any negative energy sent his way into a positive outcome. It’s not unlike the way Bitcoiners often say that “everything is good for Bitcoin”. It’s that everlasting Saturnine quality behind both phenomena — or maybe it is just something about the color orange.If you count the weeks instead from the Bitcoin white paper to Trump’s inauguration it’s 429, which is 666 - 237. This means that 237 weeks before the white paper was 666 weeks before the Trump inauguration, and likewise 666 weeks after the white paper was 237 weeks after Trump’s inauguration. Did Satoshi plan that? Perhaps he did, or perhaps that is only a side-effect of some deeper process unplanned by anyone, what you might call a decentralized signal hidden in the noise.There are more calendar connections between orange man and orange coin. For instance, Satoshi’s “birthday” on 4/5/1975 was the day after 4/4/1975, when Donald Trump became 1,503 weeks old on the same day Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded their company Microsoft. 153 is the Second Seal of Crypto-K, and one of the most important and mysterious numbers in existence all on its own. Coincidentally or not, this particular span of time — 1,503 weeks — lines up closely with what’s known to astrologers as the Saturn Return, when the planet makes a full orbit and returns to where it was in the sky at birth. This will often coincide with a person’s coming into adulthood in one form or another (a phenomenon known to most people as turning 30). During this period of his life, Donald Trump was embroiled with his father in a lawsuit for civil rights violations.Actor Heath Ledger who died on 1/22/2008, was born four years after Microsoft (on 4/4/1979), which means he was exactly 1,503 weeks old when he died.For Trump it was the full legal weight of Uncle Sam that came down on his head — in Ledger’s case, Saturn came home to roost in the form of death by an accidental overdose (or so we are told). According to NASA the actual length of Saturn’s orbit in days is 10,756. The day on which Heath Ledger would have been 10,756 days old was 9/14/2008, aka the 237th day after he died! Let it be known then that this timespan we’re highlighting — 1,503 weeks — is actually 237 days shy of a full orbit of Saturn! 237 is the Third Seal of Crypto-K, spotlighted by Stanley Kubrick in The Shining and, together with 153, they solder the orange man’s Saturn Return to the birth of orange coin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.So Satoshi Nakamoto was “born” the day after Donald Trump turned 1,503 weeks old (the same day Microsoft was “born”), 42 years after EO6102 — and the Bitcoin Genesis block was mined 420 weeks before Trump took the oath of office. Then Satoshi registered the website for his incoming digital ledger on 8/18/2008, exactly 210 days after the death of Heath Ledger. This was precisely 1,053 weeks after Donald Trump turned 42.Donald Trump’s first Monday in office as President — 1/23/2017 — was also what we call his K-Day, or the same age Stanley Kubrick was when he died. The Bitcoin white paper was published 3,006 or 1,503 + 1,503 days before Trump’s K-Day. What makes this truly remarkable is the midpoint: 12/12/2012, the day that someone using the name Nicholas von Saberhagen published the white paper for what would eventually become the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero. Some have speculated that there might be a connection between Satoshi and Saberhagen (SN/NS). This information was reported by “MoneroOutreach” in what appears to have been an April Fool’s joke on 4/1/2020. A fact is that Satoshi made his final forum post on 12/12/2010, meaning Saberhagen published the CryptoNote white paper on a two-year “delta” with Satoshi’s final message, not unlike how the orange logo was published only hours after the two-year “delta” of the Satoshi white paper.Anyone who has read Infinite Jest knows that April Fool’s day can carry serious undertones (especially in spycraft). It would be a mistake to discount this report as totally worthless. The tone seems off somehow, like it’s a joke being told by someone who knows it’s not a joke, but needs it to seem like it is, while also communicating (with no hands) the underlying truth — that Satoshi and Saberhagen were one and the same.This deliberately paced article mentions three specific dates — two we already know from the first paragraph, and then in the fourth paragraph, “August 13, 2010”, the day of a forum post by Satoshi first referencing the privacy tech that would eventually be implemented into Monero. The magic of this day becomes apparent when you check it against the BTC Genesis block — 42 + 42 weeks apart, meaning it’s also in a 42-week line-up with the Trump inauguration 336 weeks ahead (aka 77 months, 7 days!), which is a remarkable parallel with Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment every 336 hours. In other words Satoshi’s first mention of ring signatures came 420 - 42 - 42 weeks before the Trump inauguration, similar to the difficulty adjustment every 2,100 - 42 - 42 blocks.The report from MoneroOutreach on 4/1/2020 was published exactly 20 days, 3 months, and 7 years after the Saberhagen white paper — but further fuel for the conspiratorial fire is that it was also day 1,776 after the death of legendary mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr. and his wife Alicia in a car crash on the New Jersey turnpike on 5/23/2015. John Nash — who you might remember as being played by Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind — remains one of the more intriguing under-the-radar candidates for the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto due to his singular genius in all the requisite fields. Forgetting the Oscar-winning cartoon for a moment, the real John Nash was a visionary-grade cryptologist, mathematician, and game theorist who harbored a lifelong interest in applied economics (not to mention programming and the internet). Late in his life (in the early 2000s) he lectured and wrote on the subject of Ideal Money, and was publicly concerned with countering the mounting effects of decades of inflationary Keynesian monetary policy. We can theoretically surmise that the people in charge of implementing Nash’s ideas from above wouldn’t have been too keen on the concept of ideal money (Bitcoin). In order for it to work it would anyway have had to be released “in a roundabout way” (as Hayek suggested). So was born Satoshi Nakamoto, an alter-ego for a man already haunted by voices — and so went he, out of the window of his taxi, once his managers finally realized what he had done. That’s if you buy the theory, at least.It’s highly speculative conjecture backed mostly by synchronistic evidence, but hear it out anyway. In Clint Howard’s brother Ron Howard’s 2001 film A Beautiful Mind, John Nash was played by Russell Crowe, while his wife Alicia (in real life an honored native citizen of El Salvador, funnily enough) was played by Jennifer Connelly. In the film we see Connelly/Alicia as a devoted wife standing by her husband as he wrestles with his “demons” while carrying out work he believes he has been singled out to perform by a ‘higher authority’. That film released in December 2001 — but 13 years later the acausal ordering principle struck once more when Crowe and Connelly were cast as husband and wife again, this time in Darren Aronofsky’s 2014 Biblical epic Noah, where we again see Connelly as a devoted wife who stands by her whacko husband as he wrestles with his demons and carries out work he believes he has been singled out to perform by a higher authority. Noah and Nash are a lot alike, are they not?What work was that again? Oh yes, building the Ark, an engineering project from God to allow humanity and the animals to endure the incoming deluge. Any Bitcoiner worth their salt has already understood the parallel. The orange coin has been referred to as a financial Noah’s Ark on more than one occasion, seemingly engineered (by God, of course) to help humanity stave off an inflationary financial apocalypse, and Nash has emerged (independently) as one candidate for the anonymous builder of that financial Ark. It’s a theory bolstered synchronistically by how the same actors that played Nash and his wife in a Hollywood film, later played Noah and his wife in a Hollywood film about building the Biblical Ark! Again the dichotomy presents itself: Does this represent intentional encoding of media by Hollywood filmmakers and producers, or is it an example of Jung’s acausal ordering principle, where humans can’t help but make certain decisions, telling on ourselves over and over? Good luck getting a consensus on that question.So, again, the 4/1/2020 report on the Satoshi/Saberhagen matter was published 1,776 days after John Nash and his wife died on 5/23/2015. If there’s anything to compare this to it’s that likewise, Queen Elizabeth’s death on 9/8/2022 arrived 1,776 days after the inaugural Q drop. 1776 was spotlighted by the founding of the USA that year and is the Fifth Seal of Crypto-K, so these are syncs, to be sure, but it’s possible — if however infinitesimally — that all of these items are related on a material level. John Nash remains one of the most convincing candidates for the mantle of Satoshi (even without the Hollywood casting magic) and this April Fool’s dispatch was suspiciously well-timed against his death, which, at this point, might as well be deemed an assassination. It feels like the universe has a secret to tell us, and is using us as its implements to do so.There’s another temporal tell tying Nash’s possible assassination on 5/23/2015 to Bitcoin: It happened exactly 333 weeks after the Genesis block. In other words, Nash died when the Bitcoin timechain was half of 666 weeks old. If Nash was assassinated for his secret work on Bitcoin, the people who did it would probably go about timing it perfectly according to their secret midnight rituals, and this might be evidence of that — they love their 3s. Or it could be evidence of something else.Nash died 333 weeks after the Genesis block — so we ask what happened 333 weeks before the Genesis block, or 666 weeks before Nash died? That day is 8/17/2002, a Saturday. The synchronicity that must be remarked on here is how that weekend (Friday, or the beginning of that week, as Mark LeClair would have us believe) a movie was released starring Eddie Murphy called The Adventures of Pluto Nash. Taking place on the Moon in the year 2087, Murphy plays Pluto Nash, an ex-con trying to run a successful lunar nightclub all while evading the lunar mafia. Despite the decent cast, the film was a horrendous bomb, but the universe often uses bombs like these to conceal its deeper truths. Pluto represents Hades, or death itself, so the combination of Pluto and Nash in the title character of a film (in which Nash is being hunted by the “Mafia” who wish to kill him) released 666 weeks before the car crash that killed John Nash and his wife — with the BTC Genesis block at the midpoint. It more than bears mentioning. It’s downright freaky.Another detail about John Nash that adheres to the architecture of Crypto-K is that he was born in the same year as Stanley Kubrick — 1928. In fact, Nash’s birthday 6/13/1928 and Kubrick’s birthday 7/26/1928 together bracket a span of only 42 days. The Shining received wide release on 6/13/1980, but it premiered three weeks earlier on 5/23/1980, which means that The Shining released on John Nash’s 52nd birthday, while Nash and his wife were car-crashed 35 years after The Shining premiered — 35 years being exactly 420 months, and 52 years being 666 - 42 months. In other words, when a person turns 52, they are one “reign of the Beast” (Rev 13:5) away from 666 months old.The exact midpoint of John Nash’s life hit on 12/3/71. See it? The 237? Since we’re comparing Nash to Kubrick, we can provide the ready-made knowledge that Kubrick’s life midpoint arrived on 11/15/1963 — one week before the JFK assassination.Do you want to guess how much time passed from Stanley Kubrick’s midpoint to John Nash’s midpoint?Exactly 420 weeks. The same length of time as from the Genesis block to the inauguration of Donald Trump! What’s more, the day of Nash’s midpoint — 12/3/71 — was the same day the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki premiered his De Natura Sonoris No. 2, music which would later be incorporated by Stanley Kubrick into The Shining! Could this get any more convoluted? Of course, it’s that symmetry thing again, drawing what we call a parent-thesis: Nash’s midpoint arrived 420 weeks after Kubrick’s midpoint, so what happened 420 weeks before Kubrick’s midpoint? You’ll never guess, so it’s 10/28/1955, the birthday of Bill Gates, who has already been mentioned in connection with the founding of Microsoft the day before Satoshi Nakamoto’s “birthday!” Small world, hey?In A Beautiful Mind, Jennifer Connelly plays a beleaguered wife who, in trying to protect her child, stumbles onto her crazy husband’s papers which prove that he’s schizophrenic. That’s a virtual mirror to The Shining where Shelley Duvall plays a beleaguered wife who, in trying to protect her child, stumbles onto her husband’s private papers which prove that he’s insane. According to Mark LeClair again, Jack Torrance represents Saturn, the demiurge, the “master of time”, an archetype Kubrick also applied to himself via the backstage documentary shot by his daughter Vivian Kubrick, where we see them dressing alike, dramatically typing away at a typewriter, and even hassling “Wendy” — aka Shelley Duvall. Kubrick wanted us to see him squarely equating himself with the character of Jack Torrance — i.e., Saturn. So it would seem that in the year 2001 the character of John Nash in A Beautiful Mind also was overlapped by the same Saturnine trope as Jack and Kubrick in The Shining — and then it happened again with Noah in Noah! It’s almost like the universe (or VALIS) was trying to tell us something, and this is how it speaks.Nash’s birth brackets 42 days with Kubrick’s birth, and the midpoint of Nash’s life on 12/3/71 came 420 weeks after Kubrick’s life’s midpoint.So what about the end of their lives?If you go look it up, you’ll find that Nash died 846 weeks after Kubrick, a figure which amounts to 420 + 420 weeks, plus 42 days.Who exactly is doing all this, and why?One person who was verifiably involved in the beginnings of Bitcoin was of course Hal Finney, who was right there to help Satoshi along when the first BTC client launched on 1/9/09, and he was there to receive the first BTC transaction from Satoshi in block 170 on 1/11/09 — which, by the way, occurred exactly 153 + 153 + 153 weeks before the first post from another anonymous internet entity, Q (the 17th letter), on 10/28/2017.Hal Finney’s birth on 5/4/1956 means that on the day of the Bitcoin Genesis block, he was 19,237 days old. Here we have the Third Seal, 237, combined with what we call the “Ruler” — 19. One property of 19 that remains relevant is how it alphanumerically translates to AI, the abbreviation for artificial intelligence, now positioned as the existential threat of our time. Some Bitcoiners have wildly claimed that BTC represents the counterbalancing force required by nature for humanity to resist AI’s eventual total liquid control of all centralized systems, though none of them have been clear on the specifics of how that might work. But in this regard — BTC vs. AI — the name “Hal Finney” carries certain connotations, because “Hal” is the name of Kubrick’s malevolent AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey: HAL 9000. “Finney” could be read as finis, for finished, as in “HAL finished” — AI finished.What’s in a name? In this case, perhaps the sum total of a man’s mission on earth.It was noticed early on that Stanley Kubrick’s death on 3/7/1999 occurred 666 days before 1/1/2001. It took some time for Crypto-K to come along and ask, What happened 666 days before Kubrick died? The answer turned out to be the day that chess grandmaster Gary Kasparov lost a match to the computer Deep Blue, making it the first time that the best human had lost to an artificial intelligence in match-play chess — much the same way that Frank Poole lost to HAL in the film. Compounding the sync is that the computer Deep Blue was built by IBM, and modeled after the Monolith from 2001!The trope continues to express itself: Man vs. Machine, in a chess match for all the marbles, with history itself the board for the Game of All Time.Is Bitcoin someone’s idea of checkmate?Satoshi Nakamoto appeared in digital public for the last time 15 years to the day after Kubrick died — with a message that read “I am not Dorian Nakamoto” — and then exited the stage for good, much like Flight MH370 which disappeared along with Satoshi less than 24 hours later. Satoshi’s final message on 3/7/2014 meant that the total time elapsed from his first published word to his final published word was 279 or 42 + 237 weeks. Hal Finney would find his own end later that year, succumbing to ALS on 8/28/2014, 4,200 hours after Satoshi’s final post — and John and Alicia Nash would be taken less than nine months after that.His death on 8/28/2014 meant that Hal Finney’s life’s midpoint occurred around 7/1/1985 — a scant 42 hours before the release of Back to the Future, a movie about a plan to use time-travel technology to stop a “terrorist” attack and break a temporal curse.We know Bitcoin is the clockwork orange, but could it also be the flux capacitor?Maybe what you’ve read here seems to you like the ravings of a man who has not been properly medicated. But hopefully some shards of this screed will stick in your temporal lobe anyway and in a few weeks or months you’ll be compelled for one reason or another to think about it again, and say, “Huh, maybe that number freak was onto something”. We’ll see.The Fourth Halving took effect on 4/19/2024, when the BTC timechain was exactly 19 × 42 weeks old — the Ruler (AI) meets the First Seal and the orange coin, a showdown for life, the universe, and everything.Perhaps Satoshi planned that one ahead of time as well, but even if not, he would have loved how perfectly it all worked out."

Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Rollups - The Rock Or The Hard Place?,"Mon, 09 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-rollups-the-rock-or-the-hard-place,"A look at the scalability limits of rollups, and the choices in making decisions regarding maximizing it.","Rollups have become the narrative focus of scaling Bitcoin lately, becoming the first thing to truly “steal the limelight” from the Lightning Network in terms of wider mindshare. Rollups aim to be an off-chain layer two that is not bound or constrained by the liquidity limitations that are central to the Lightning Network, i.e. end users required someone allocate (or “lend”) them funds ahead of time in order to be able to receive money, or intermediary routing nodes requiring channel balances that can facilitate the movement of the payment amount all the way from sender to receiver. These systems were originally developed to function on Ethereum and other Turing complete systems, but as of late the focus has shifted to porting them to UTXO based blockchains such as Bitcoin. This article is not going to discuss the current state of things being implemented on Bitcoin currently, but going to discuss the function of an idealized rollup that people are aiming for in the long term depending on features Bitcoin currently does not support, namely the ability to verify Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) on Bitcoin directly. The basic architecture of a roll is as follows: a single account (or in Bitcoin’s case UTXO), holds the balances of all users in the rollup. This UTXO contains a commitment in the form of a merkle root of a merkle tree that commits to all the current balances of existing accounts in the rollup. All of these accounts are authorized using public/private key pairs, so in order to propose an off-chain spend a user must still sign something with a key. This part of the structure allows users to leave without permission whenever they want, simply by crafting a transaction proving their account is part of the merkle tree, they can unilaterally exit the rollup without the operator's permission. The operator of the rollup must include a ZKP in transactions that update the merkle root of account balances on-chain in the process of finalizing off-chain transactions, without this ZKP the transaction will be invalid and therefore not includable in the blockchain. This proof allows people to verify that all changes to off-chain accounts were properly authorized by the account holder(s), and that the operator has not conducted a malicious update of balances to steal money from users or reallocate it to other users dishonestly. The problem is, if only the root of the merkle tree is posted on-chain where users can view and access it, how do they get their branch in the tree in order to be capable of exiting without permission when they want to? Proper RollupsIn a proper rollup, the information is put directly into the blockchain everytime that new off-chain transactions are confirmed and the state of the rollup accounts change. Not the entire tree, that would be absurd, but the information necessary to reconstruct the tree. In a naive implementation, the summary of all existing accounts in the rollup would have balances and accounts simply added in the transaction updating the rollup.In more advanced implementations, a balance diff is used. This is essentially a summary of what accounts have had money added to or subtracted from them during the course of an update. This allows each rollup update to only include the changes to account balances that occur. Users can then simply scan the chain and “do the math” from the beginning of the rollup to arrive at the current state of account balances, which allows them to reconstruct the merkle tree of current balances. This saves a lot of overhead and blockspace (and therefore money) while still allowing users to guarantee access to the information needed for them to exit unilaterally. Including this data in a formal rollup that uses the blockchain to make it available to users is mandated by the rules of the rollup, i.e. a transaction that does not include the account summary or account diff is considered an invalid transaction. ValidiumsThe other way to handle the problem of data availability for users to withdraw is to put the data somewhere else besides the blockchain. This introduces subtle issues, the rollup still needs to enforce that the data was made available somewhere else. Traditionally other blockchains are used for this purpose, specifically designed to function as data availability layers for systems like rollups. This creates the dilemma of security guarantees being as strong. When the data is posted directly to the Bitcoin blockchain, consensus rules can guarantee it is correct with absolute certainty. However when it is posted to an external system, the best it can do is verify an SPV proof that the data was posted to another system. This entails verifying an attestation that data exists on other chains, which is ultimately an oracle problem. Bitcoin’s blockchain cannot verify anything completely except what occurs on its own blockchain, the best it can do is verify a ZKP. A ZKP however cannot verify that a block containing rollup data was actually publicly broadcast after being produced. It cannot verify that external information is actually publicly available to everyone. This opens the door to data withholding attacks, where a commitment to the data being published is created and used to advance the rollup, but the data is not actually made available. This renders users funds beyond their ability to withdraw. The only real solution to this is to depend entirely on the value and incentive structure of systems completely external to Bitcoin. The Rock and Hard PlaceThis creates a dilemma in terms of rollups. When it comes to the data availability issue, there is essentially a binary choice between posting the data to the Bitcoin blockchain or somewhere else. This choice has massive implications for both rollup security and sovereignty, as well as their scalability. On one hand, using the Bitcoin blockchain for the data availability layer introduces a hard ceiling on how much rollups can scale. There is only so much blockspace, and that puts an upper limit on how many rollups can exist at one time and how many transactions all rollups in aggregate can process off-chain. Every rollup update requires blockspace proportional to the amount of accounts that have had balance changes since the last update. Information theory only allows data to be compressed so much, and at that point there is no more potential for scaling gains. On the other hand, using a different layer for data availability removes the hard ceiling on scalability gains, but it also introduces new security and sovereignty issues. In a rollup using Bitcoin for data availability it is literally not possible for the state of the rollup to change without the data needed by users to withdraw being atomically posted to the blockchain. With Validiums, that guarantee depends entirely on the ability of whatever external system is being used to resist gaming and data withholding. Any block producer on the external data availability system is now capable of holding Bitcoin rollup users’ funds hostage by producing a block and not actually broadcasting it to make the data available. So which will it be, if we ever do get to an ideal rollup implementation on Bitcoin that actually enables unilateral user withdrawal? The rock, or the hard place? "

Bitcoin Magazine,Japan's Largest Power Company TEPCO is Mining Bitcoin Using Renewables,"Mon, 09 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/japans-largest-power-company-tepco-is-mining-bitcoin-using-renewables,"Japan's largest power company TEPCO has begun mining Bitcoin through its subsidiary using excess renewable energy, showing how Bitcoin can incentivize green energy growth.","Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), Japan's largest electricity provider, has begun mining Bitcoin through its subsidiary Agile Energy X using excess renewable energy that would otherwise be wasted, as per reports from Asahi.JUST IN: 🇯🇵 Japan's largest power company TEPCO is mining #Bitcoin using surplus energy. pic.twitter.com/ZrsmbV7mv6— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 9, 2024  With over 27 million residential and business customers, TEPCO established Agile Energy in 2022, and now they are exploring Bitcoin mining powered by surplus renewable energy. The subsidiary has installed mining rigs next to solar farms in Japan's Gunma and Tochigi prefectures.The initiative helps reduce wasted green energy from solar and wind farms that are forced to curtail production to avoid overloading Japan's grid. This energy is now being diverted to generate Bitcoin.""Green energy producers have to operate their businesses on the assumption that part of the power they generate is wasted,"" said Agile Energy President Kenji Tateiwa. ""If bitcoins were to provide a new source of income for similar power producers, who are being exposed to overinvestments, that would prompt more green energy to be introduced.""The project shows how Bitcoin mining can incentivize renewable energy growth by providing producers with additional revenue streams. Tateiwa said Bitcoin profits could encourage further investment in clean energy to power the mining.Other countries are also tapping excess renewables for Bitcoin mining, like El Salvador, which uses its geothermal energy. This dispels the myth that Bitcoin is environmentally hazardous, as much mining uses energy that would otherwise be wasted. More and more companies and countries are figuring out how to turn waste and surplus energy into the hardest money on earth. As more renewables come online, Bitcoin mining will help reduce wasted power and emissions."

That’s about 15,000 to 30,000 votes,” he added.“When you add up how many people in our state are investors in crypto, that number is far greater than the margin of victory.”Far greater is an understatement, as 385,000 Nevadans own crypto, according to the Stand With Crypto Alliance. This number was plastered across screens at the event for the entirety of the evening.“In my business, we always say the market will decide,” began Conine.“Well, guess what, folks? You're the market, and your vote matters. Elections in this state are always very close, and they're not close because everybody votes and both sides are even. They're close because some people vote, but a lot of people stay home,” he added, before urging those in the audience who weren’t registered to vote to do so while stressing that the crypto vote can sway the ballot in upcoming elections at both the state and federal levels.Rouch, a resident of Nevada, also issued a call to action from the stage.“We need you guys this election,” she said.“It is critically important to figure out where the politicians in your district, in the state, stand on crypto — to really ask them the hard questions — and to tell your friends and family to get out there and vote.”Nevada as a Home to the Bitcoin and Crypto Industry“Las Vegas is a city of opportunity — above and beyond the casino floors,” shared Vinuya from the stage.“Nevada is home to an emerging center of technology and financial innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth,” he added before citing that the Governor’s Office of Economic Development facilitated $5 billion in economic investment last year and that the state saw 4% job growth in the same time period.  Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine addresses the audience.  Part of this trend was fueled by Nevada’s embrace of the crypto industry.“Amidst all of these exciting achievements under the leadership of Governor Lombardo and Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman, Nevada has also become a home for innovators in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency,” he explained.Vinuya then pointed out that next year’s Bitcoin conference will be based in Las Vegas.“Here in our state, we have a good concept coined by Governor Lombardo called ‘the Nevada way,’ which means that as Nevadans, we never give up, we never give in, and we never stop dreaming,” he concluded. “The spirit of the Nevada Way is alive and well in the Bitcoin community, and we welcome your innovation and big dreams in Nevada.”Capitalizing on Political MomentumAccording to Rouch, we’ve hit the point of no return with crypto, and politicians can no longer afford to not take a stance on the issue, which is why Coinbase supports the Stand With Crypto Alliance.“What we're really saying here is ‘pay attention,’” Rouch told Bitcoin Magazine. “This matters to a lot of voters.”After citing that 52 million Americans of varied backgrounds, ethnicities and socioeconomic status now own crypto, Rouch explained that politicians, up the federal level, now see how big of an issue this is and are acting accordingly.“We've seen undeniable change in Washington, DC over the last year from both parties,” she said.“We had FIT21 pass in the House with a bipartisan vote. That was really unprecedented. We also have politicians making their statements on crypto known for the first time, and I feel very optimistic about that,” she added.Rouch wasn’t the only speaker or performer at the event feeling optimistic.Before beginning his DJ set, 3LAU told the story of how he met the Winklevoss twins, early bitcoin buyers and owners of the Gemini crypto exchange, at a gig a decade ago. He shared how they explained what Bitcoin was to him at that event, and that it gave him hope.  3LAU giving a thumbs up to Bitcoin and crypto voters during his DJ set.  “Bitcoin changed my life, and it’s been that way for the past 10 years,” said 3LAU to the crowd before he started his DJ set.“This election is probably the most important in my life. We have a choice — to make the future of the financial system or follow the legacy bullshit that we’ve had to put up with,” he added.“And we’re all going to fucking vote for crypto.”"
Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin's Potential Rally Amid U.S. Dollar Weakness,"Fri, 06 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoins-potential-rally-amid-u-s-dollar-weakness,Analyzing the recent drop in the Dollar Strength Index and its implications for Bitcoin.,"Bitcoin and the U.S. dollar have a long-standing inverse correlation, notably when observing the Dollar Strength Index (DXY). When the dollar weakens, Bitcoin often gains strength, and this dynamic might now be setting the stage for restarting the BTC bull cycle.DXYThe Dollar Strength Index (DXY) measures the value of the U.S. dollar against a basket of other major global currencies. Historically, a declining DXY has often coincided with significant rallies in Bitcoin's price. Conversely, when the DXY is on the rise, Bitcoin tends to enter a bearish phase.  Figure 1: Bitcoin and DXY have historically been inversely correlated. View Live Chart 🔍  We have recently seen a significant decline in the DXY, which could be signaling a shift toward a more risk-on environment in financial markets. Typically, such a shift is favorable for assets like Bitcoin. Despite this downturn in the DXY, Bitcoin's price has remained relatively stagnant, raising questions about whether BTC might soon experience a catch-up rally.  Figure 2: Recent downturn in DXY. View Live Chart 🔍  Sentiment ShiftingCoinciding with the decrease in demand for the U.S. dollar, the high-yield credit data suggests increasing demand for higher-yielding corporate bonds. This indicates that investors are more eager to obtain outsized returns, and historically this appetite has resulted in more significant capital inflows and higher prices as a result for Bitcoin.  Figure 3: High Yield Credit demand is increasing, indicating a shift to a more ‘risk-on’ sentiment. View Live Chart 🔍  Lagging Behind?In comparison, the S&P 500 has seen substantial growth in recent weeks, while Bitcoin has remained relatively stagnant. However, the increasing correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P500 suggests that Bitcoin might soon follow the upward trend we’ve seen in traditional equities.  Figure 4: S&P500 has recently outperformed BTC, and given the strong correlation between S&P500 & Bitcoin there’s a chance we’ve got some catching up to do. View Live Chart 🔍  ConclusionIn summary, while Bitcoin has been slow to react to the recent decline in the DXY, the broader market conditions suggest a potential for a bullish phase in our current cycle. We’ve seen a shift in sentiment amongst traditional market investors and, subsequently, a period of outperformance for the S&P500.Whether the market is overestimating the impact of the dollar's decline remains to be seen, but the potential for a rally is there.For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out a recent YouTube video here: The US Dollar Decline Will Be the BTC Bull Market Catalyst"
Bitcoin Magazine,"Politicians, Founders Motivate Crypto Voters on Day One of the America Loves Crypto Tour","Thu, 05 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/politicians-founders-motivate-crypto-voters-on-day-one-of-the-america-loves-crypto-tour,Prominent politicians and crypto industry leaders from Arizona encourage pro-crypto voters to head to the polls in November on the first stop of a five-date swing state tour.,"On a 100°F evening in Phoenix, crypto enthusiasts from Arizona came out with gusto for the first night of the America Loves Crypto tour.The tour, organized by the Stand With Crypto Alliance, a non-profit on a mission to get America’s 52 million crypto owners out to the polls in November, will roll through five swing states in the coming weeks, bringing awareness to the importance of voting for candidates who support pro-crypto policies in the upcoming US elections.On this evening in Arizona, politicians such as Senator Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) and Arizona House Speaker Pro Tempore Travis Grantham (R) spoke to the audience alongside crypto industry founders before making way for the psychedelic soul grooves of the Black Pumas.The Mission and the Margin“A huge priority for us is turning out the crypto vote,” Logan Dobson, Executive Director of Stand With Crypto, told Bitcoin Magazine.“Our only cause is crypto. We’re not pushing for specific candidates. We’re not pushing for specific parties. We’re just getting the crypto vote out,” he added.“And I can tell you that in multiple swing states already, there are more people who have signed up with Stand With Crypto than the margin of victory was in 2020.”Dobson’s final point is particularly pronounced in Arizona, where, in the 2020 presidential election, President Biden beat former President Trump by about 10,500 votes. Stand With Crypto has signed up almost three times the amount of crypto advocates — 27,231 — than the amount of voters who accounted for Biden’s margin of victory in the previous election.Encouragement from PoliticiansSenator Sinema kicked off the event, urging audience members to fearlessly vote for candidates who support pro-crypto policies.“You guys are a real force in Arizona and it’s important that we use this election cycle to ensure that the crypto community’s voice is heard,” said Senator Sinema.“We’ve got to push for policies that fuel innovation so the financial system works for everyday people. We’ve got to make sure that candidates up and down the ballot — state legislatures as well as at the federal level — understand crypto and are working towards a great political climate for crypto rather than one that’s based on misinformation, fear and old-school regulations that hinder the industry,” she added.Sinema concluded her brief speech with what seemed like a mild jab at the Democrats, the party she parted ways with in December 2022.“Don’t be afraid to support a candidate or an elected official who takes risks,” she said.“You all understand the value of taking risks. The crypto industry wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for risk taking,” Sinema added.“We want to look for candidates who are reasonable but are willing to take risks and speak out against the party line rhetoric that’s trying to stop or slow the innovation of this industry.”Following Sinema was Grantham, a proponent of the freedom with which bitcoin and crypto provides its users.Grantham didn’t mince words from the stage. He discussed how politicians are abusing the US dollar by spending more of it than they have and printing it at will. He made the case that it’s up to Gen Z and Millennials especially to vote for pro-crypto politicians to allow for assets like bitcoin to compete against the dollar. He was even more explicit on this topic in an interview backstage with Bitcoin Magazine.“There’s a large group of elected officials who think the government is the solution to our monetary problems, that this fiscal irresponsibility doesn’t matter and that the dollar is going to be the end-all-be-all forever — and that’s just a crazy way of thinking,” Grantham told Bitcoin Magazine.“One of the reasons [crypto] is becoming so popular is because of what we’re doing to the dollar,” he argued.  Arizona House Speaker Pro Tempore Travis Grantham (R) addresses the crowd.  For this reason, Grantham felt it’s essential for voters to support candidates who don’t believe in regulating crypto out of existence, and to vote for politicians who support freedom as opposed to those who seek control.“It’s a freedom and control issue,” said Grantham.“[Some politicians want] control by keeping everybody married to one currency and not allowing anything else to break through, which crypto is doing. Competition is a good thing, especially when the person who controls the only thing is abusing it so badly,” he concluded.Founders Aren’t Asking For MuchNext, a panel of crypto founders based in Arizona took the stage. The panel featured Thor Abbasi, co-founder of DeFi protocol Zivoe; George Mekhail, VP of Operations for Bitcoin Magazine and co-organizer of the Arizona Bitcoin Network; and Shelton Beascochea, co-founder of DevilsDAO and Stand With Crypto Arizona Chapter President.The industry leaders asked for little more than clear rules of the road from the US government, so that they could operate their businesses on-shore and compliantly. In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Abbasi discussed the anxiety that crypto founders have faced due to unfair treatment by federal regulatory agencies under the Biden administration.“One of the toughest things for our project is [knowing] how the industry can interact with banks,” Abbasi told Bitcoin Magazine.“We've all probably heard about Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” he added, referring to the government’s unconstitutional crackdown on the politically unfavorable, but not illegal crypto industry, which resulted in the debanking of many crypto companies.“If we had regulation describing what crypto companies need to do in order to be banked, that would be hugely beneficial.”  George Mekhail addresses the crowd as part of a crypto founders panel.  Mekhail ended the spoken portion of the night’s programming on a high note, highlighting that the crypto industry has made notable progress, which will likely only gain steam moving forward.“Think about where we were four years ago,” said Mekhail.“We couldn’t have an event like this. The fact that 15% of Americans own some form of crypto is crazy, especially thinking about what it’s going to be four years from now,” he added.“The momentum is behind us. It’s events like this and just showing up and demonstrating that we have a voice that is really important.”The second date of the America Loves Crypto tour is scheduled for this evening, September 5, at The Space in Las Vegas, NV. You can RSVP to the event here."
Bitcoin Magazine,Venezuelan Opposition Leader María Corina Machado Calls Bitcoin a “Lifeline” in Exclusive Interview,"Thu, 05 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/venezuelan-opposition-leader-maria-corina-machado-calls-bitcoin-a-lifeline-in-exclusive-interview,"María Corina Machado, Venezuelan opposition leader, discusses Bitcoin as a ""vital means of resistance"" for Venezuelans suffering from hyperinflation under the Chávez and Maduro regimes.","In an exclusive interview with Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer of the Human Rights Foundation (HRF), Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado discussed Bitcoin’s vital role in combating Venezuela’s economic collapse and authoritarianism. The interview, first published on Bitcoin Magazine, highlights the catastrophic impact of hyperinflation caused by the Chávez and Maduro regimes, which have devastated the Venezuelan bolívar.Machado noted that under Chávez and Maduro, the bolívar has lost 14 zeros, with inflation skyrocketing to 1.7 million percent in 2018. She described the economic destruction, stating, “This financial repression rooted in state-sponsored looting, theft, and unchecked money printing” crippled the economy despite Venezuela's vast oil wealth.During the interview, Gladstein emphasized how some Venezuelans turned to Bitcoin as a way to escape hyperinflation, protect their wealth, and fund their escape from the country. Machado echoed this, calling Bitcoin a ""lifeline"" for Venezuelans, a way to bypass government-controlled exchange rates. She proposed including Bitcoin in Venezuela’s future national reserves as the country seeks to recover its stolen wealth and rebuild from the dictatorship.“Bitcoin bypasses government-imposed exchange rates and helps many of our people... It has evolved from a humanitarian tool to a vital means of resistance,” Machado stated.Machado also spoke of the Venezuelan people’s determination to reclaim democracy, noting their historic efforts in confronting the regime. She hailed the use of technology like Bitcoin to ensure financial autonomy and help rebuild a new, free Venezuela.Looking to the future, she envisions Bitcoin playing a key role in ensuring transparency, property rights, and economic freedom as part of Venezuela’s recovery plan, stating, “We envision Bitcoin as part of our national reserves, helping rebuild what the dictatorship stole.”Those interested in supporting the Venezuelan opposition party's efforts for a peaceful transition and the recognition of their victory can do so via the HRF here."
Bitcoin Magazine,Advancing Bitcoin Security: The Journey from Basic Wallets to Advanced Protocols,"Thu, 05 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/advancing-bitcoin-security-the-journey-from-basic-wallets-to-advanced-protocols,A look at the history of the evolution of Bitcoin wallets.,"Security strategies within the Bitcoin network are in a constant state of progression, and in this exploration, we will assess how these strategies have evolved from simple digital wallets to complex multi-signature mechanisms. This includes an overview of the latest advancements in cryptographic technologies, such as Schnorr signatures. In simple terms, we will examine these technologies that help to provide the necessary fortifications that act as the foundation behind Bitcoin’s security framework. We will also consider some of the major security incidents in recent years and the lessons that were learned. The overall aim of this piece is to emphasize the importance of the Bitcoin community in developing new ways to secure Bitcoin infrastructure and strengthen blockchain technology - this need is further emphasized by the impending threat of quantum computing … How Has Bitcoin Security Has Evolved Over The YearsSince Bitcoin’s launch in 2009, the world of finance and technology has been completely transformed, moving toward ultimate financial freedom as an ambitious yet noble goal. As a decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has surged in value and become the 13th major currency in the world. However, this value has also presented a range of security challenges. To think that, just a decade and a half ago, the most we could do with Bitcoin was to buy a pizza, it’s not hard to see how we ended up with today’s wallet standards. Bitcoin initially relied on rather basic security solutions such as digital wallets that stored cryptographic keys to facilitate transactions. These wallets, although effective in basic terms, lacked the necessary security to prevent malware threats and cybersecurity threats which quickly became more sophisticated as the years passed - requiring innovations to keep Bitcoin safe. Software WalletsEarly digital wallets were basic software that sat on a person’s hard drive, storing private, cryptographic keys that allowed users to access and transfer their Bitcoin. As Bitcoin’s value grew and cybercriminals became aware of its potential, the need for better security became paramount to prevent widespread hacking and theft. Initially, digital wallets were improved with better encryption and dedicated user interfaces but this did little to stem the tide of a growing number of cyber threats. Improving and maintaining software wallets became a somewhat futile task for developers who were forced to constantly run API penetration tests, stress tests, and various other security exercises to ensure a high level of security. As a result, a new, more practical solution was created. Hardware WalletsThese hardware devices stored private keys offline and negated a lot of the threats that were linked to software wallets that were connected to the internet. Hardware wallets came in the form of a small device that connected to a computer via USB — two popular hardware examples were Ledger and Trezor. Although hardware wallets were offline and required a pin code to access, and if lost, recovering these pin codes was a multi-faceted process. This higher level of security led to these devices growing in popularity as they were not susceptible to malware attacks, private keys never left the device, and transactions were completed within the wallet before being confirmed on the blockchain.Multi-signature WalletsThese advanced wallets required multiple signatures or approvals from multiple users before any transactions could be executed. This drastically reduced the chance of any unauthorized access and this method was favored by businesses and organizations who regularly made large-scale Bitcoin transactions. To make a transaction, two or more private keys are required to authorize the activity, similar to written contracts that require multiple signatures. This way, even if one private key has been hacked, the Bitcoin within the wallet still cannot be accessed. Advancements/ Taproot and Schnorr SignaturesTaproot was a significant upgrade to the Bitcoin network that was designed to improve scalability and brought about a series of enhancements. One such enhancement was Schnorr signatures which offered multiple benefits over the previous Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) mechanism which facilitated the generation and verification of private keys. The key benefits of Schnorr signatures were that they allowed for smaller signature sizes, offered quicker verification times, and provided better protection against certain cyberattacks. Key aggregation was the most significant enhancement of Schnorr signatures which reduced the size of multi-sig private keys so they take up less space in a block and incur the same transaction fees as a single-party transaction. Another important upgrade was the non-malleability feature that prevents cybercriminals from modifying a valid signature to allow them to commit malicious activity. Schnorr signatures also improve the privacy of multi-sig wallets, increasing their complexity significantly when compared to single signatures. Preparing For Future Threats To BitcoinThe rise of quantum computing poses a significant threat to Bitcoin, as these machines can solve extremely complex problems that standard computers cannot. This can include deciphering cryptographic keys. Should this technology become more accessible and fall into the hands of cybercriminals, the risk of unauthorized access to all types of wallets becomes significant and could lead to the complete collapse of the cryptocurrency market if there is no solution. The Bitcoin community has been busy conducting ongoing research to assist in the development of quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. The hope is that the development of these advanced algorithms will provide sufficient protection against this impressive computational power but the key challenge is the successful implementation of them into the Bitcoin network. This process will be extremely complex, requiring a precise orchestration of all users, from developers to miners. Creating algorithms that even a quantum computer cannot crack is a monumental task and is described as post-quantum cryptography. Although the development of these cutting-edge algorithms is still in its early stages, more and more developers are lending their hand to the cause and things are expected to accelerate in the next few years. High-Profile Bitcoin Security IncidentsLet’s consider two recent Bitcoin security incidents that have caused major disruption and helped to change the way we think about securing cryptocurrency. Ronin Network breach - In March 2022, the highest-value cryptocurrency attack was the breach of the Ronin Network which powered the extremely popular Axie Infinity blockchain gaming platform. By breaching this network, cybercriminals stole around $625m worth of cryptocurrency. North Korean state-backed hackers, Lazarus Group are thought to be the culprits and It is believed they obtained five of the nine private keys held by transaction validators that were required to access Ronin Network's cross-chain bridge (a decentralized application that facilitates transactions). Binance Exchange hack - Back in October 2022, one of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance was hacked, with $570m stolen. Hackers targeted the BSC Token Hub, a cross-chain bridge, and exploited a bug in a smart contract to extract Binance coins. As well as high-profile cases such as this, the countless number of individuals that cybercriminals have targeted is an even bigger concern. Some people can become complacent when it comes to securing their Bitcoin keys, while various platforms can employ outdated processes or need to provide more security. For example, If a wallet, platform, or application has a QR code for registration, this can be a significant security flaw, especially given that hackers have already targeted features like this. Conclusion - What Have We Learned?These high-level cybercrime cases show that even the most advanced and high-profile cryptocurrency institutions struggle to keep up with the latest cybercrime techniques. In addition to vast and complex blockchain networks and secondary-level, third-party applications, the resources needed to secure Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are substantial. Although multi-sig wallets provide impressive protection, they are not ironclad. This is why developing advanced algorithms, such as those created to fend off quantum computing attacks is the key focus to ensure the future of cryptocurrency. This is a guest post by Kiara Taylor.

Bitcoin Magazine,Blockstream Opens New Funding Round For Its Second Bitcoin Mining Security Token,"Thu, 05 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blockstream-opens-new-funding-round-for-its-second-bitcoin-mining-security-token,Blockstream’s second Mining Note — the BMN2 — is designed much like the successful BMN1.,"Today, Blockstream opens the series 3 round for its second Mining Note — the BMN2.The note will be available to eligible non-US investors and has been repriced from the series 1 and 2 rounds, which occurred on July 18. This round of the BMN2 is priced at $31,000 petahash per second (PH/s), or a hash price of $21.23. Investors who purchased the BMN2 in the series 1 and 2 rounds, during which the note sold at a higher price, will be awarded extra BMN2 to make up for the difference in price between the first two rounds and the third.The issuance of the BMN2 comes on the heels of the success of the first Blockstream Mining Note, the BMN1, which provided a 32% return over BTC.Details of the BMN2The BMN2 will be a hashrate-backed security token offering (STO) issued on Blockstream’s Liquid Network by Luxembourg-based virtual asset service provider (VASP) Stokr. The note offers 1 PH/s at Blockstream’s North American mining operations for four years.“Hashrate contracts are typically 30 days up to six months,” James Macedonio, Senior Vice President of Global Sales at Blockstream, told Bitcoin Magazine, highlighting how the duration of Blockstream’s note differs from other financial products like it. “Rarely do you see [contracts] even go to 12 months.”Blockstream is offering the note in 1 PH/s increments because petahash has become the industry standard for measuring hash price, and the contract’s duration corresponds with the four-year Bitcoin halving cycle.“We wanted to lock in a hash price for customers for four years, which will basically run until the next halving,” he said.The minimum investment for professional investors is $10,000, while non-professional investors have a $115,000 minimum investment threshold. Shares of the STO will be fungible and will be available for trading, in both full and fractionalized form, on secondary markets including Bitfinex, SideSwap and Merj Exchange. Macedonio explained that Blockstream’s pricing is competitive, as the note will sell for a 50% discount to the current spot hash price.“If you're looking to buy hashrate, this is going to be a lot cheaper than buying a hashrate contract on the open market,” he said.The Success Of BMN1The BMN1, which offered 2 PH/s over a 36-month term, mined 1,242 bitcoin, delivering up to 103% cash-on-cash returns and the aforementioned 32% return over BTC. Blockstream is aiming to provide similar returns to investors with the BMN2.“We priced the BMN2 to a level at which we feel investors will get the same type of return,” said Macedonio.“We sold BMN1 at about a 60% discount to what would have been the hash price at the time. With the BMN2, we're selling at about a 50% discount to the current spot hash price. Future series pricing will be dependent on what the hash price is at that time,” he added.Blockstream will reward investors who roll over from BMN1 to BMN2 with a 3% bonus in additional BMN2 securities.BMNs Stand Apart From Similar ProductsBlockstream Mining Notes offer investors looking to gain exposure to bitcoin mining a unique value proposition.“We get really cheap energy rates and we get good pricing on equipment, as well,” said Macedonio. “So, we can offer a hashrate at a really cheap price compared to other folks.”Macedonio highlighted that the BMN2 is priced at the equivalent to hosting mining equipment at 4.5 cents per Kilowatt hour (kWh), whereas large customers currently pay upwards of 6.5 cents/kWh for hosting arrangements.He also noted that, with BMNs, investors don’t have to buy machines, nor do they have to worry about machine failures or power curtailment. Plus, investors don’t experience a lag in putting the money down for their investment and machines going online when they purchase BMNs.“I don’t think there’s another product out there that competes with it,” said Macedonio."
Bitcoin Magazine,Coinbase CFO Says Kamala Harris Campaign Accepts Crypto Donations: Fortune,"Wed, 04 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/coinbase-cfo-says-kamala-harris-campaign-accepts-crypto-donations-fortune,Fortune reports that Coinbase CFO said Kamala Harris is using Coinbase Commerce to accept cryptocurrency donations for her presidential campaign.,"According to Fortune, Coinbase’s Chief Financial Officer, Alesia Haas, said that U.S. Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is using the company’s Commerce platform to accept cryptocurrency donations for her campaign. The statement was made during a conversation with Citigroup’s Director of Payments, Peter Christiansen, at the Citi 2024 Global TMT Conference in New York, in which Fortune reviewed a recording of the conversation.JUST IN: Coinbase CFO says Kamala Harris campaign is using Coinbase to accept crypto donations — Fortune 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/EWhSFY205R— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 4, 2024  “She is accepting crypto donations,” reportedly said Haas. “She’s using Coinbase Commerce now to accept crypto for her own campaign.”However, pro-Harris advocacy group Crypto4Harris said that they were unaware of this move. Additionally, Harris's official fundraising site does not yet display crypto donation options. So far, Harris’s campaign and Coinbase were reached out to for comment, but Fortune has not heard back yet at the time of writing.The ""Crypto for Harris"" initiative, launched last month, aims to garner support from crypto enthusiasts as Harris seeks to strengthen her presidential bid. “She has a huge opportunity, we’re cautiously optimistic,” Haas reportedly continued. “She has not rolled out the details yet, but she has made overtures that she would like to drive crypto legislation.”Harris’ decision to accept cryptocurrency donations marks a strategic move to rival her opponent Donald Trump, who earlier this year embraced Bitcoin Lightning Network donations for his campaign. Trump's alignment with the Bitcoin community was further solidified when he spoke at The Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville—an event Harris notably declined to attend."
Bitcoin Magazine,Choose Privacy,"Wed, 04 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/choose-privacy,"Technological capability, on its own, is not enough to create Bitcoin privacy. Unless users and society actively defend and demand privacy, it will die. From ""The Privacy Issue"".","This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine's ""The Privacy Issue"". Subscribe to receive your copy.Privacy is a fundamental issue in using a public blockchain system like Bitcoin. Numerous projects and proposals have been made over the years to either build privacy preserving tools on top of Bitcoin, or fundamentally add privacy at the protocol layer itself. Satoshi himself discussed briefly the idea of zero knowledge proofs being a mechanism to enable greater privacy before he left. This is all the original whitepaper had to say on the topic of privacy:10. PrivacyThe traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the ""tape"", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.    As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.—----------------That’s it. That is the only consideration Satoshi gave in releasing Bitcoin to the transactional privacy of its users. Don’t reuse addresses, and carefully think through when you spend a coin together with another one because it will create transparent ownership links on the blockchain. Fifteen years later we have a comprehensive enough body of knowledge and experience to know that this section in the whitepaper is woefully incomplete. It was nothing more than an abstract description of the model within which private, or non-private, use of Bitcoin would evolve over the coming decade. His advice to avoid spending coins together is no more practical than someone advising you to never spend more than a single cash note when buying something for the rest of time. It was inevitable that in the course of using Bitcoin as a currency people would regularly have to spend multiple coins together, inextricably linking their funds together over the time in the course of successive transactions. Basic heuristics such as spending coins together form the basis of blockchain analysis, and the unraveling of people’s transaction history. If multiple coins are spent together in a single transaction, it's a good assumption that all of those coins are owned by the same person. If an address is used to receive multiple coins from different people, those are all owned by the same person. When large groups of coins get spent together and connected over time, this forms a cluster. All of these, and other, basic heuristics are why Bitcoin’s blockchain are not private. You can watch transactions on-chain and apply these heuristics to them. Now before I go any further, that was a critical point to make early on to ensure people could reason about it correctly, but it prescribed no reasonable or useful models for how to proactively maintain your privacy as a user. This is one of Bitcoin’s fundamental shortcomings. The protocol itself does not provide any tool or architecture to inherently protect the privacy of its users, that is left entirely up to them. Choosing PrivacyMany protocols have been designed over the years to try to address this problem:Coinjoins: Protocols where users collaborate to spend their coins together, allowing them to send the same amount of coins to each of their addresses in the same transaction, confusing observers as to who’s coins went where. Coinswap: Protocols where users can privately perform a swap involving two transactions where they exchange their coins with each other. As long as both parties cooperate with each other, no connection is visible on the blockchain between the two transactions. Chaumian Ecash Mints: Protocols allowing a centralized issue to mint cryptographically blinded tokens structured in a way that they cannot tell which token is which when a user goes to redeem them. It facilitates centralized yet highly private transactions. Confidential Transactions: One of the components that is critical to Monero, it was originally developed by a developer working on Bitcoin. It obscures the amounts cryptographically blinding them, and providing a proof that the outputs to a transaction are equal to or less than the inputs without showing them. It was highly inefficient at the time it was proposed, and would have exacerbated Bitcoin’s scaling issues. It also allows a quantum attacker to secretly inflate the Bitcoin supply without being detected, or unravel everyone’s transaction history, if they can break the cryptographic assumptions Bitcoin depends on, depending on which types of cryptographic commitments it uses. Zerocoin: A scheme created to allow depositing coins into a single “escrow pool”, withdrawing later with no connected on-chain history to before verified by a zero knowledge proof. It was never implemented because the scheme was very computationally intensive to use at the time.The first two of these proposals are application layer proposals, they are things that can be built on top of Bitcoin right now. No changes are necessary, and anyone can build software and tools allowing users to utilize either protocol. The second two are fundamental upgrades to Bitcoin at a protocol level. They cannot just be done now, and require convincing people to upgrade Bitcoin in a way that comes with non-negligible trade offs. In my opinion those upgrades will most likely never happen. That leaves us with things we can build now. Many tools have already been built, and many more will have to be built, but our path forward is paved with privacy tools that people have to choose to use. If no one makes use of them, they are useless. No one can achieve privacy alone in a public system like Bitcoin, you need other people in order to achieve privacy on a blockchain, you need a crowd to hide in. This is very much an individual choice, yet at the same time each individual’s choice has a profound impact on the whole of everyone using Bitcoin. It is one of the most important choices there is to make regarding Bitcoin. If people do not value their privacy enough to act to preserve it, then privacy on Bitcoin will die. It will become verboten, something ostracized at first, then actively penalized and punished as time goes on. Governments will stigmatize it, regulate it away, and relegate it to an obscure minority on the fringes of society. At that point, privacy on Bitcoin will have failed. Even Eric Hughes, the author of the Cypherpunk Manifesto, coiner of the phrase “cypherpunks write code,” realized later on that code alone was not enough: “Perhaps the single most important lesson I've learned from cypherpunks is that code alone doesn't cut it. Not code alone, not code widely distributed, not even code widely used. Some measure of toleration in society for activities conducted in private is necessary for long term success. Not convenient, not easier, but necessary.” -Eric Hughes, Cypherpunk Mailing List Mar 14, 1996. People must choose to value privacy at large. It must be a valuable thing to them, valuable enough that they will act even in the face of coercion and intimidation to achieve it. It must be widely tolerated in society, the same way that free speech is in America, or the right to bear arms. It must be something so widely supported that even in the face of fierce opposition from some segment of society, governments will not act to outright stifle it in the face of the size of its support. People must disobey such attempts in such large numbers that it is socially and practically intractable to actually enforce them. This decision, and the actions that follow it, is very much a political decision. A political act. People must act, or this battle is already lost. Building PrivacyWe are going to assume for now that people will act, and in sufficient numbers to be successful. So what exactly do they do? Without fundamental changes to the protocol people have to opt into specific tools in order to preserve their privacy. What tools? How do they work? We went over a handful of tools above, but we did not really go into a deeper or holistic view of how they work. It’s important to understand how different tools can interact with each other. Seen in a vacuum, it's easy to walk away thinking that any individual privacy tool on Bitcoin can never be good enough on a technological level, but when you start to look at all of them interacting together it should be apparent that a very strong degree of privacy can be achieved. If users adopt all of these tools together. Almost everything in Bitcoin is composable, none of the tools people have at their fingertips exist in a vacuum. Different things can be used in synergistic ways, whether that takes the form of being combined outright into single tools or multiple tools being used in tandem. Let’s go through the current state of things from top (upper layers) to bottom (the base layer). Chaumian EcashChaumian ecash mints are an old idea predating Bitcoin by decades. David Chaum came up with the concept in 1982. Chaumian ecash utilizes blind signatures to create a private payment mechanism. In the scheme, a central mint server acts as a token issuer, facilitating the creation of new tokens backed by deposits and redeeming tokens for new ones to process transactions. The private nature of the transactions it processes are powered by blind signatures. Each token is essentially just a random value signed by the mint. In the naive case of such a scheme, the mint would be able to track the redemption of each token it signed, correlating the one being redeemed with the one being issued and viewing each token chain's transactional history. By blinding each token value before submitting to the mint for signing, the mint is unaware of the exact value it signed. After acquiring the mint’s signature, they can unblind it, resulting in a perfectly valid signature from the mint on the plaintext of the token value the user generated. The mint would only see a plaintext token whenever it was redeemed to be issued a new one, and because the token was blinded when it signed it, it would have no idea when or for who it signed. This allows for centralized, but incredibly private, transactions. The mint will have no idea who is paying who when it redeems tokens for new ones. For the cost of trusting the operator to custody funds, users can realize a level of almost perfect privacy. It also has no requirements for receiving liquidity or other shortcomings protocols like Lightning suffer from. Any user anywhere willing to trust a mint can receive money privately simply by receiving a token from another user and redeeming it for a new one from the mint. The utility of ecash goes far beyond just private scalable payments as well, ecash tokens can be made programmable. When someone uses a Chaumian mint, they are trusting the operator to process payments honestly and not steal everyone’s money. There is no reason at that point why they can’t also do more than process payments. They can also enforce smart contracts. The same way that Bitcoin script allows people to program conditions on when their bitcoin can be spent, mints could use script or other programming languages to allow users to program conditional spending requirements into ecash tokens. Rather than just generating a random value to blind for the mint to sign, users could generate a script program to blind. After the mint signs it, when someone comes to redeem that token they will see the script it is programmed with. The mint simply refuses to authorize a redemption unless the script is fulfilled. There are a few different trust models possible now, with more surely to come as people think more about how they can be built. The simplest and most straightforward is a single operator. This is the same as any custodial system like Coinbase. The next is a federated operator, distributing the trust across multiple parties. This puts ecash on par with many other systems built in this space people consider decentralized. There are even suggested models that invert the entire risk relationship, where the chaumian mint issues tokens backed by its own money, lending them out to users and periodically calling in the debt. So, even right now, we can achieve an enormous amount of privacy…but at the cost of a loss of sovereignty and control over our own funds. This is far, far from ideal, but it’s a path forward that is open to us now. We just need there to be enough people operating these, and a solution for people using different mints to interact with them. Enter the Lightning Network. It allows seamless deposits and withdrawals by users interacting with a mint, and a quick settlement mechanism for a receiving user to cash in a mint from one token and transfer it to another mint they prefer using or trust more.Lightning NetworkLightning is a network of bi-directional payment channels, allowing users to route payments off-chain across this network. Users collaborate with one another to lock funds in a two party multisig address, using pre-signed transactions to ensure each party can claim their funds back without any help if necessary. After being established, the balance of funds can be updated off-chain by signing a new set of transactions and exchanging “penalty keys” that would allow the other party to confiscate the entirety of a cheating user’s funds in the channel if they attempted to use any old transactions on-chain. Lightning, while far from perfect, is a massive improvement in terms of privacy compared to on-chain bitcoin use purely by virtue of not recording every transaction that occurs on the blockchain. Rather than every transaction a user makes permanently recording the history of where coins came from and where they went, the only visible history on the blockchain is the creation of the payment channel. Nothing about payments made or received is visible to the general public, only the counterparty the channel was opened with. As far as the off-chain footprint is concerned, things are a bit more nuanced. Receivers for instance currently reveal their Lightning node to anyone paying them. This could be addressed with BOLT 12, a proposal incorporating a scheme called blinded paths which obscures the receiver’s Lightning node from the sender by having them compute the last few hops in the payment route. Senders however currently have excellent privacy, with the receiver learning nothing about their Lightning node or funds. Lightning has some rough edges for end users to deal with though. Namely the requirement to have liquidity allocated by their channel counterparty to receive money, and the inability to receive more money than their channel counterparties have available to route to them. It functions amazingly as a payment routing network, assuming users have addressed the liquidity issues. Most users address these by making use of a Lightning Service Provider (LSP). They fill the role of providing liquidity for users to receive money, but the trade off of solving that problem comes with privacy trade offs. The LSP is a large entity serving many users, and in the process learns about a large number of users’ payment activity. In some cases, particularly LSPs that make use of Trampoline Routing (a scheme where the LSP calculates a payment route for you), they even learn the destination of all their users’ payments. Some of these issues can be addressed by bolting Chaumian ecash mints on top of Lightning. By having many users “use” a single Lightning node operated by the mint, liquidity allocated so the mint can receive funds can be shared more efficiently by all users. The private nature of ecash also helps shield users from some of the privacy shortcomings of Lightning. Even if the mint, the Lightning node operator, knows where payments it makes across the network are going, it doesn’t know which user(s) made them. Overall use of Lightning directly by a user is not as private as Chaumian ecash, and does come with the added issues of having to source receiving liquidity and interact with LSPs, but it does not require relinquishing control of your funds. It can’t scale as well as ecash, and is more complicated to use, but it has a far superior trust model. One thing Lightning doesn’t do however, is completely obscure the ability to track coins moving on-chain. It might hide and obscure individual payments conducted off-chain, but it is still possible to track coins into a channel, and track where they go when that channel is closed. Coinjoins Coinjoins are a protocol that enables multiple users to collaborate together to craft a transaction structured in a way to make tracking their coins difficult or impossible. Heuristics like common input ownership and clustering are the basis of tracking people’s funds. Breaking these is how to protect your privacy. Coinjoins accomplish this by structuring the amounts going in and out of a transaction properly.Assume you have five people who want to obscure their transaction history, by combining their coins together in a single transaction and all creating outputs of the same denomination they create a false positive for common ownership by spending their coins together and create a false cluster. Because the outputs are of the same denomination, no one can be sure when they are spent in the future whose coins they actually are. Now consider a Lightning user again. Even if realizing the maximum privacy benefits possible with Lightning, they still need to consider the privacy implications of interacting with the blockchain. Imagine a user withdrew coins from a KYC exchange and opened a Lightning channel. He might be able to make thousands of transactions back and forth over Lightning, but when he closes that channel with less funds than he put into it, the exchange can see that he at least spent that much somewhere in his off-chain activity. When he spends those coins with other coins known to be his, or opens a new Lightning channel associated with his node with them, the exchange can be even more confident they are still under his control. These connections need to be broken and obfuscated. That is the role coinjoins can play. Coinjoin was the most widely deployed protocol for base layer privacy, the two largest examples being Wasabi by ZKSnacks and Whirlpool by Samourai. Samourai was recently shut down after the founders were arrested, and Wasabi voluntarily discontinued the operation of their coordinator shortly after. Both of these systems depended entirely on a centralized coordinator server to help users actually construct their coinjoin transactions. Joinmarket is another option that is operational currently, using a decentralized model where “takers” (users) select from a market of “makers” (liquidity providers) to coordinate coinjoins. Joinmarket however is not as well developed or maintained as there is no company behind it. It is a purely open source project. These are not the only options by any means. People can spin up a Wasabi or Whirlpool server again if they want, people can even design new coordination models for serverless coordination. The coinjoin transaction itself, and how it is coordinated, are very separate things despite being related. There are many different ways the goal of coordinating the creation of the coinjoin can be accomplished. And importantly, it is permissionless to try new ways. The Holistic StackNow that we’ve gone through these pieces, think about how they all interrelate. How they form together to create a holistic synergy at every layer to maximize privacy. Users transacting with an ecash mint have a massive degree of privacy even from the mint operators, those mint operators in using Lightning can themselves achieve substantial privacy for themselves and their users interacting with other mints, and in reorganizing liquidity on the base layer coinjoins can keep even that activity done on a public blockchain obscured. Even without radical changes to Bitcoin itself, there is a path forward from where we are now to a private and censorship resistant Bitcoin. It is not ideal, it does require either costs and complexity or compromising on the desired goal of trustlessness, but it is possible. Going forward, it can be made even better with each improvement made to the Bitcoin protocol. Covenant schemes that improve scalability could address some of the issues with systems like Lightning. This would allow more users to be able to interact with Bitcoin in a private way self-custodially, rather than having to delegate control of their funds to a chaumian mint. Some of these scaling improvements might even reduce the need for on-chain privacy schemes such as coinjoins. Having more people share custody of a single coin in a trustless manner would introduce natural ambiguity as to who is doing what when withdrawals are made from that coin. We have a path forward even now, and that path will get brighter with each improvement made to the Bitcoin protocol. People just have to choose to actually walk down it. A Future With Privacy, Or A Future WithoutPrivacy might seem to some like a thing not worth caring about, or not that important. “What do you have to hide anyway?” I think those people simply don’t appreciate the implications of having no privacy. Look around at the world today, look at how quick people are to ostracize and shame someone publicly for innocuous things. Holding the wrong opinion, saying the wrong thing, voting for the wrong politician. More and more the lack of privacy in regards to personal life is causing disastrous and traumatizing consequences for people. It is vitally important that people actually have control over what information about themselves is or is not made available to the public. This is not just a matter of criminals wanting to hide nefarious or horrific things, it is about everyday people being able to protect themselves from the whims of the mob. Going even further than that, people living under totalitarian or oppressive governments around the world have much more to lose than a job or social standing if they are not able to maintain privacy. They can literally lose their lives. Privacy can be the difference between physical safety and danger even for people living in a safe and free jurisdiction. Imagine if in the course of transacting with someone you revealed that you own a sizable amount of bitcoin, you have now in a very real sense opened yourself up to the possibility of physical danger. There are numerous documented cases of kidnappings, physical assault, even torture by criminals attempting to steal bitcoin from individuals who have revealed themselves to be wealthy. Even domestic violence is an example of a situation where privacy is of utmost importance. One of the biggest reasons people do not leave abusive relationships is the financial inability to. How can someone in that situation attempt to work their way towards financial independence to leave without privacy? Without the ability to save and earn money without their partner discovering it? Privacy is important. To come back to Bitcoin, one of the chief properties it is valued for is its censorship resistance. The ability to transact however and whenever you want, without permission, without someone else having the ability to stop you. Transactions have two parties though, a sender and a receiver. A buyer and a seller. If governments, regulators, the mob of the public, all can track your payments and coins in public, how can you have censorship resistance? How can that exist when any government or mob can coerce and threaten people to not transact with you? How can Bitcoin be censorship resistant when everything you do can be followed, and when you become persona non grata, the weight of government and social pressure can prevent others from interacting with you? Remove that choice from the individual of whether to transact with you or not, and impose a decision on them? When a merchant has to worry that if they receive “the wrong coins” the government will track them down and seize them, resulting in them losing money? It can’t.If coins can be distinguished from each other in any meaningful way, and tracked as they move around, Bitcoin starts breaking down and not even functioning properly as a money. Money has to be fungible, i.e. two coins must be indistinguishable from each other from a merchant’s point of view. To be fungible, it has to be private. Privacy, fungibility, and censorship resistance are all facets of the same thing. They can only exist together.People have to choose to value privacy, or Bitcoin will lose its censorship resistance. Most people won’t choose privacy over purely ideological grounds, or political grounds, they will need to be shown it is actually useful. They need to actually see and use something that lets them donate to a cause important to them without being shamed or attacked for it. They need to see that people in a totalitarian state can actually use it to accomplish something meaningful. They need to actually see the eerie and creepy omnipresent ads online disappear or become wildly inaccurate as they make purchases privately, out of sight of the big data fishing net. This is the most important battle Bitcoin will ever face, and we are at an inflection point in that fight right now. The outcome of this fight will shape Bitcoin for the rest of its existence. Will it be a tool for sovereignty and freedom, or one for surveillance and oppression? That is up to us to decide. I do not want to live in a world where I have no privacy of thought, of interaction, of transaction. Where every action I take, every thought I utter, or even think, is put under the scrutiny of the government and the mob of the public. Where the slightest misstep leads my life to ruin, with no room for dissent or dialogue or debate. I choose privacy. I choose censorship resistance. I choose freedom. "

Bitcoin Magazine,UTXO Research Report: State Of The Bridges,"Wed, 04 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/state-of-the-bridges,A research report analyzing the different trust models and functioning mechanisms of proposed and existing two-way pegs for Bitcoin layers.,"As we enter a new era of development on Bitcoin, it has become very hard for most people to understand the nuances of the L2 debate, and ever harder to follow some of the technical jargon associated with it. Sidechains, rollups, sequencer, multisig, ZKP…. In this report, we’ll try to shed some light on those concepts by outlining the UTXO thesis for Bitcoin L2s and by answering the following questions: Does Bitcoin even need Bridges? What are the differences between sidechains (BOB, Botanix, etc..) and rollups designs (Alpen, Citrea)? What are the strategies employed to convince Bitcoiners to bridge their BTC? What are the different BitVM implementations and how do they revolutionize Bitcoin Bridges? Can rollups compete with existing L2 designs such as Lightning? Table of contents:Questioning the Necessity of BridgesThe Current State of Bitcoin BridgesUnderstanding the Friction Between Solving Technical Challenges and Growing a Sustainable User Base.The Future State of Bitcoin Bridges (BitVM and others)The Thesis for Bitcoin Rollups and Bridge InnovationKey Takeaways:Delivering on the promises of Bitcoin Season 2 will require a lot more funding and research toward bridge design, blockspace dynamics, and interoperability. Sidechains exist on a spectrum and the Bitcoin “L2” category is a victim of ambitious marketing despite harboring a great deal of innovative new bridge systems that provide a valuable alternative to rollups. Rollups are going to be more impactful on Bitcoin than they’ll ever be on Ethereum and have the potential to reach over $133 billion in TVL over the next five years. BitVM and ZKP research is at the forefront of Bitcoin innovation and will become the most important topic of this cycle. Investment in companies capable of solving the upcoming problems related to Bitcoin rollups is paramount, including MEV research, data availability, decentralized sequencing, attestation chains, and of course, UX.    Questioning the Necessity of BridgesWhen we talk about scaling Bitcoin, the same questions inevitably arise to remind us of the scale of the challenge. Among them, the question of whether the Bitcoin base layer should scale was answered long ago during the Blocksize Wars: Bitcoin will have to scale in layers. Layers, however, are a heterogeneous bunch and many different mechanisms exist to build them. One of the oldest and simplest ways of bringing scale to Bitcoin is sidechains. But sidechains are not technically a true “layer” of Bitcoin since they often lack the unilateral exit component that makes them trustless for users, i.e., with the same trust assumptions as the base layer. That is why, for the many years that followed the introduction of SegWit, the Bitcoin community focused a lot of energy on building the Lightning Network (a true L2 that depends on Bitcoin security to provide users with unilateral exit options) instead of sidechains. In order for users to join a sidechain, they first have to execute what we call a “peg-in” transaction (or “peg-out” to exit) — basically sending their BTC to an address controlled by the operators of the sidechain. The mechanism securing this system is called a bridge. The reason why bridges are so tricky is that they often rely on a multisignature wallet holding all the sidechain’s funds, and in order to execute withdrawals, users have to trust that a majority within the multisig will cooperate to accept it. For example, a group of 20 companies would set up a bridge contract together, requiring at least 12 (could be less or more) companies to confirm a withdrawal transaction. For obvious reasons, this never was an optimized security model and created great incentives for companies (or individuals) to potentially collude and steal user funds. A few examples of interesting sidechain design emerged during that time, such as Liquid (federation of companies) and RSK (merged-mined sidechain), but they never truly succeeded at scale. Before we go any further, let’s add some definitions from the researchers that have spent the most amount of time thinking about this — Bitcoin Layers. Sidechain is an L1 that exists to add more functionality to BTC, the asset. L1s are sovereign in technical architecture but typically exist as subsets of the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. It’s common for sidechains to enshrine a BTC bridge into their consensus mechanisms or involve Bitcoin miners in consensus — through merge mining or fee sharing.Rollup is a modular blockchain that uses a parent blockchain for data availability. The blockchain stores its state root and enough transaction data to reconstruct the state of the blockchain from genesis in the parent blockchain. Rollups are L2s.Two-way pegs are systems that facilitate the minting and burning of BTC-backed tokens on a Bitcoin layer or alternative L1. These systems are also known as bridges.So, if bridge designs have existed for a long time and they haven’t generated a lot of traction, why do we need them now? While Lightining dominated the L2 space for a long time, 2023 saw the introduction of a new idea that would challenge that dominance: BitVM. In a nutshell BitVM can allow Bitcoin to be more programmable, which could lead to the introduction of new L2 designs such as rollups. These new designs all rely on an old friend on sidechains: the bridge mechanism that allows users to go from the base chain to the sidechain. However, the promise of BitVM relies on the idea that we could make bridges more decentralized than with traditional sidechains by introducing a challenge mechanism that could punish dishonest actors in a federation. Therefore, rollups on Bitcoin would not be completely trustless but trust-minimized. You would still need to rely on an honest actor (we’ll dive into the specifics later in this report) to exit the chain (rollup) but this is a trade-off that many users could get comfortable with, given the potential scaling and programmability benefits. BitVM (and Robin Linus) essentially revived the idea of Bitcoin bridges, and brought more legitimacy to them as a way to scale Bitcoin. Bridge design is now part of every scaling discussion, and several Bitcoin companies are now fully dedicated to researching innovative ways of improving them. Now that we’ve seen why Bridge has made a comeback as a legitimate way of scaling Bitcoin, one could still argue that rollups enabled by BitVM will suffer the same fate as previously mentioned Liquid or RSK — a very limited user base. While this could be true, the success of rollups on Ethereum indicates a very strong demand from users and a lot of appetite from investors. The screenshots below, taken from the leading ETH rollups analytics platform L2Beat, show that the top 10 rollups on ETH have managed to accumulate close to $40 billion in assets bridged. Arbitrum, Base (Coinbase), and Optimism together have over 71% market share. Furthermore, over the past year only, the amount of ETH locked in rollups went from $6.1 million to $13.1 million, a 114% increase.   Source: https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvl    Source: https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvl  In fact, rollups are going to be more impactful on Bitcoin than they’ll ever be on Ethereum. If we assume the same level of rollup utilization (10.4% for ETH) and take the size of both networks as of July 2024 — $383 billion for ETH vs $1.276 trillion for BTC — we could make the simple calculation that the total addressable market for Bitcoin rollups could be around $133 billion. While this number is impressive, one could even argue that Bitcoin will require even more scale than ETH as it is poised to become the settlement network for all economic applications, and therefore rollups would have the potential to become even larger still.   Seeing this potential, a ton of developer mindshare came back to Bitcoin and sparked a true renaissance for the space. Anticipating that Bitcoin users will be interested in bringing more utility (yield) to their holdings, sidechains came back in full force at the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024. Over 70 projects launched with the promise of decentralizing their bridge design once the technology was available, while others created innovative bridge designs. The no-bridge meta. Although not the focus of this research piece, it is important to mention that many projects in the L2 space are trying to scale Bitcoin without the need for complex bridge systems. These protocols will play an integral part in the race for scalability on Bitcoin as they provide a valuable alternative for users not willing to make certain trade-offs. Arch: The Arch Network employs an innovative approach to state management on Bitcoin’s layer 1, utilizing ordinals through a unique “state chaining” process. State changes are committed in a single transaction, reducing fees and ensuring atomic execution. Built to add programmability without necessarily sacrificing self-custody, Arch makes it possible for Bitcoin users to develop and interact with decentralized applications without taking on additional trust assumptions. Its novel architecture consists of a two-piece execution platform: The Arch zkVM and the Arch Decentralized Verifier Network.QED: QED solves the fundamental scaling problem of blockchains by using zk-PARTH, a novel state model which enables massively parallel transaction proving and block generation. This allows QED to scale to millions of transactions per second, while guaranteeing security via proof of math.RGB++: RGB++ protocol is not BitVM even though it can provide native Turing-complete capability on Bitcoin layer 1. It neither relies on any new OP codes nor does it require hard forks or soft forks but rather directly provides programmability on layer 1. It also is not an EVM or a rollup, and it does not need a bridge. The RGB++ protocol attaches additional data as an extra program logic to the original Bitcoin UTXO. A single Bitcoin UTXO is linked with an off-chain data cell (or what is termed a Turing-complete UTXO). By connecting every on-chain UTXO with off-chain data and extra execution logic, the off-chain UTXO is transferred — despite being constrained by the script on the UTXO — whenever the original UTXO is transferred or spent. This allows the transfer of additional bits or assets from one UTXO to another, executing the script and effectively forging an off-chain transaction with off-chain state transfer from one state to another.The Current State of Bitcoin Bridges Now that we’ve established that new bridge designs can be of revolutionary value for Bitcoin as a settlement network, let’s dive into the current landscape of Bitcoin bridges, their architectures, optimizations, and different variants. Let’s take a look at a few different L2/sidechain designs, and how teams are thinking about mitigating certain trade-offs associated with their bridging mechanism.    In a nutshell, we can identify four different types of bridge designs: Traditional Bridges: Normal bridges as described above. Reinforced Bridges: Reinforced bridges are bridge designs that have an additional layer of security added in order to mitigate some aspects of the protocol that could be too centralized. In the case of BOB (Built on Bitcoin) for example, phase 2 of the roadmap is planning to remove trust in (centralized) sequencers with Bitcoin miners running full nodes of BOB and thereby verifying that the sequencer is producing valid blocks. This offsets trust in the sequencer and thereby provides Bitcoin security through mining to a rollup. This will be achieved using an alternative version of merge-mining called Optimine.  Source: https://docs.gobob.xyz/docs/learn/bob-stack/roadmap  Optimized Bridges: Optimized bridges are bridge designs that innovate by distributing trust among the participants of the multisig. A great example of an optimized bridge design is Botanix. The bridge multisig is constantly distributed among different users; it can evolve and change between blocks. In the case of Botanix, the bridge is also reinforced with a proof-of-stake (POS) system that becomes complementary to the FROST-based architecture. Trust-Minimized Bridges: These bridges are currently being developed by rollup teams and will feature near trustless assumptions, with the possibility of users even outside of the multisig to participate in the protocol.    Understanding the Friction Between Solving Technical Challenges and Growing a Sustainable User Base. 1. The birth of an L2: choosing the best go-to-market strategy. For Bitcoin builders in 2024, there are only two options that can make sense in the context of the Bitcoin L2 paradigm: Choosing to focus on the technical challenges of bridging architecture and rollup design to build a trust-minimized layer with complex zero-knowledge proofs and BitVM optimizations. This is the Technological approach. Choosing to focus on the fastest go-to-market strategy by making calculated trade-offs with bridging architectures and execution environment in the hope of decentralizing those once the technology is available. To differentiate from current competitors and protect themselves from future ones, companies have to bring additional incentives in the forms of points or tokens to acquire users. This is the Community Moat approach. With the Community Moat approach specifically, the trade-off is simple: sacrifice decentralization in the medium term in order to gain TVL and a solid user base in the short term. While this approach may be criticized by hardcore Bitcoiners, it reflects a business-first mindset that is often lacking to many projects that end up failing despite being technologically superior. Execution is EVERYTHING. Those different approaches are the reason why having an intellectual debate on Bitcoin L2s has been so difficult recently. People tend to conflate the goals of companies attempting to solve a Technological problem with companies attempting to solve a User Acquisition problem. These companies have fundamentally different go-to-market strategies and therefore will use fundamentally different methods to convince users that they are, indeed, the best Bitcoin L2 (or the first). 2. Sidechains vs rollups: being on the spectrum. That’s really what it comes down to. There’s going to be Bitcoin sidechains, Bitcoin rollups, and everything in between. Bitcoin L2s exist on a spectrum, where the extreme is dominated either by builders going for the Technological approach or the Community Moat approach. Let’s dive into the spectrum.    As Janusz from Bitcoin Layers would say, “Not every Bitcoin layer is made equal” and most people in the space have a tendency to discard companies choosing to focus on the faster go-to-market sidechains approach while admiring the complex work done by BitVM/ZKP researchers. (Please refer to the definitions of sidechains and rollups at the beginning of this piece if you’re struggling to understand why their approach is different.)While we can understand that point of view from a Bitcoin Maximalist perspective, I think it is a fundamental mistake from a free market perspective. While the technology approach might be more intellectually pleasing, and the perspective of having a truly decentralized L2 exciting, actual users tend to have different priorities.    While this spectrum can be a useful tool to understand the trade-offs that companies make, ultimately, users will decide on their own how to prioritize UX, cheap fees, fast settlement, and protocol security. When you look at the current state of the crypto market, it isn’t clear that the technology-first approach can compete with the memetic power of a protocol like Solana. How many people in the world know of Solana compared to how many people have even heard the word rollup? At UTXO, we believe that there is value to be captured by both rollups and sidechains, especially if sidechains can deliver on their promises to decentralize over time. While this hasn’t been the case with other chains historically, we believe that once the technology is reliable and available, Bitcoin users expect trust-minimized solutions to become a standard and not just a protocol preference. 3. Do you want to make money or do you want to be right? The incentive programs of new Bitcoin layers. Let’s dive into existing projects’ go-to-market strategies and understand the opportunity size for early users and liquidity providers. The strategies described below are not exclusive to each project but we chose to focus on the ones that are the most characteristic for them. A) Point system (BOB): The BOB point system has been by far the most successful iteration of this strategy in the Bitcoin sphere. BOB Fusion is the official points program of BOB, where users can harvest BOB Spice (points) based on their on-chain activity on the BOB mainnet. B) Ecosystem first (Botanix): Choosing not to release a token at launch for their sidechain, Botanix’s approach is one of the smartest we’ve seen so far. Botanix is choosing an Application first approach but letting project building on top of Botanix shine. By partnering with Botanix, ecosystem projects will be supported with TVL from day one, and speculators’ only way to get exposure to Botanix launch will be to invest in its ecosystem apps. As we know, having a real and sticky user base actually using the application is the only way for L2s to survive in the long run, and Botanix is taking a radical approach to ensure this. C) Research (Bitlayer): With one of the most technically advanced teams in the space, one of the key differentiation points for Bitlayer has been their research-first approach, a rarity outside of rollup-only projects. Since the early days of BitVM, the Bitlayer team has been active in furthering our collective understanding of the idea and has released a number of extensive research papers on the subject. Furthermore, the team is actively exploring new ways to improve current BitVM designs and will likely be considered one of the most innovative L2 teams in the space once their research comes to fruition. The Future State of Bitcoin Bridges (BitVM and others)When we look at bridge designs it becomes apparent that the most decentralized ones will be developed with variations of BitVM. Indeed, BitVM is not a monolithic entity that one can just refer to in order to be understood in the context of Bitcoin rollups. A few teams are working on competing (and synergistic) adaptations of the initial proposal by Robin Linus. The main differences to understand in these variations of BitVM come down to a few key parameters: Trust assumptions: What is the level of decentralization of the bridge when it comes to the ability of users to trustlessly exit the rollup? In the case of BitVM and optimistic rollups, who can challenge the state of the rollup? Assumptions range from anyone (best) to only a majority of actors in the multisig (worst). Challenge response: Once a challenge has been issued to the optimistic rollup, how much time and resources (number of transactions + size of transactions at a given fee rate) are necessary for “justice to be done”? Assumptions range from months with multiple on-chain interactions (worst) to hours with a single interaction (best). From the Snarknado whitepaper: “BitVM, is, however, not without overhead. Like optimistic rollup, the proof needs a withdrawal period to allow challengers to come in. Notice that a fully on-chain challenge-response can require tens of roundtrips between the prover (called Paul in BitVM) and the challenger (called Vicky), and since Bitcoin has a block time of 10 minutes, it can be quite a long time. It is also a little bit unsure what would happen if many challengers want to challenge at the same time and whether it would affect the latency and the finality.”Capital efficiency: What are the capital requirements for operators of the rollup? How much BTC do they have to ensure that all users can withdraw funds and make transactions without any constraints? There is no good metric to objectively measure this but we can imagine a combination of “cost of capital required to lock funds for X time” + “multiple of BTC deposited by users required to be locked by operators.” Assumptions range from “high cost of capital with high BTC multiple” (worst, i.e., the incentive of operating a rollup does not make sense) to “low cost of capital with a BTC multiple of 1” (rollups can outcompete Lightning and Ark). “an operator will initially cover user withdrawal requests out of pocket then aggregate the necessary proofs into a single submission to the network. If other operators suspect foul play, they can challenge the submission. Successful challenges result in the dishonest operator losing their initial bond and being removed from the network. If the operator’s submission is not challenged, they can then reclaim the equivalent amount they disbursed from users’ original deposits.”   Despite all this innovation at the bridge level, one cannot separate the bridge from its foundation, and in the case of rollups, the foundation has to come from a few key choices in the very design of the rollup itself. For all the security and trust-minimization of BitVM bridges, in order to make a fair comparison between sidechains and rollups, we have to compare them “dans leur ensembles” (in their whole outfits). One of the herculean choices that teams will have to grapple with is the one of data availability (DA): “The publishing of transaction data which is required to verify transactions, satisfy proving schemes, or otherwise progress the chain. Specifically, a node will verify data availability when it receives a new block that is getting added to the chain. The node will attempt to download all the transaction data for the new block to verify availability. If the node can download all the transaction data, then it successfully verified data availability, proving that the block data was actually published to the network.” There are only two ways of ensuring data availability: post it directly to Bitcoin or post it somewhere else. In the case of Bitcoin rollups, by definition, one would expect that DA would always be posted to Bitcoin. However, this is a costly choice to make that will have negative consequences for both user transaction costs and rollup teams’ ability to generate net margins. In response to this, some teams have chosen to trade very real gains in security for cheaper transactions and additional scalability. The DA dilemma:    Once again, trading off security for user experience may be considered sinful by Bitcoiners, but we have seen that in the case of sidechains or certain ETH rollups, some users may prefer it. In that sense, the DA dilemma is not so much a technical challenge as it is a social one. Yes, posting DA on Bitcoin in the only way to be considered a true Bitcoin L2, but will that matter if the only rollups with users are the ones with no Bitcoin DA? Some more definitions before going further: Optimium: Optimium is an optimistic rollup that stores transaction data on-chain. This ensures availability and security, but increases costs and reduces scalability versus off-chain options. However, users need not trust third-party data providers.Validium: Validium is an optimistic rollup variant that stores transaction data off-chain. This enables high scalability and low costs, but risks potential data censorship or unavailability issues without on-chain backups. Users must trust data providers are honest and resilient.An interesting investment opportunity that arises from the situation is the development of a potential DA layer with a strong relationship to Bitcoin — the Celestia of Bitcoin. While we’re not there yet, exploring different ways of mitigating consensus failures for rollups is a big area of focus for UTXO, and has in part informed our decision to invest in CHAR by Jeremy Rubin (Bitcoin Core developer, BIP-119 author). CHAR is based on attestation chains where nodes commit to signing a single unconflicted sequence to organize transactions. By acting as a layer 2 for scale and functionality, CHAR will bring new security to BitVM with L1 bonds while incentivizing operators by distributing rewards.This new way of thinking about protocol security (consensus orchestration) will make the on-chain resolution of challenges on BitVM more efficient and incentive-aligned.While LN attempts to solve the scalability in a peer-to-peer fashion, resulting in liquidity problems, rollups take transaction execution off chain — but the current architectures make it costly to use Bitcoin as a DA layer. All systems will eventually leverage centralized solutions to improve user experience, and at this point it’s difficult to tell which trade-off is worse.Looking ahead, Citrea plans to introduce volition, a hybrid model balancing on-chain security with off-chain cost efficiency. This allows applications to choose their data storage method based on their specific needs. This is something we haven’t seen before and that would deserve more attention when it comes to the DA dilemma for Bitcoin rollups. “So depending on your usage, if you want to deploy now a gaming application, you can use off-chain data. It is very cheap, very fast, but still gets this Bitcoin interoperability. If you want to build a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin application, you can use on-chain data so your stablecoin is fully on-chain secured, fully Bitcoin secured. A bit expensive but you still get this interoperability between the gaming application and the stablecoin application.”Other challenges with Bitcoin as a DA layer. The best way to learn about this is to read the latest Galaxy Research report on Bitcoin as a DA layer. However, one of the specific challenges where we would like to spend more time is the issue of blockspace demand and fee rate dynamics.Blockspace scarcity will/could lead to centralizing forces for rollups and ultimately for pools as well. Because of the large amount of data required to settle rollup activity on Bitcoin, rollup operators may be tempted to optimize their transaction flow by using the services of pools, such as Marathon, with slipstream. These kinds of OOB (out-of-bands) agreements with miners are a centralizing force as they provide additional revenue streams to pools that are not accessible transparently on-chain. On the other hand, it is perfectly normal in a free market for competing actors to find differentiation points and does not represent a fundamental threat to Bitcoin by altering the game theory of mining (i.e., only the most cost-effective miners survive in the long term). Fee rate dynamics will once again change with the introduction of another blockspace buyer of last resort, but this time will be different. Constant demand for blockspace no matter the fee rate, is not something that Bitcoin has witnessed in its recent history. In the case of ordinals, degens minting jpegs have an incentive to always make transactions as long as blocks are not full, acting as a natural buyer of last resort for blockspace. However, ordinals and Runes/BRC-20 are time-preference aware (they can choose to wait, paying low fees, or pay high fees for fast inclusion in a block) while rollup operators cannot be. Their proofs will be submitted, at a fixed rate in time, no matter the fee rate. This kind of agnostic demand is most reflexive on fees precisly because it competes not just to be included in a block (4MB x size of the mempool) but for the very next block (only 4MB available). As the utility for Bitcoin as the settlement chain for all economic activity continues to grow, we can expect these types of demand to increase, further impacting fees to the upside. In that case, the economic case for rollups may become less clear as their attractiveness compared to the Lightning Network in terms of costs starts to be less competitive. In SOTB_2, the second part of this research series, we’ll dive deeper into how the activation of different opcodes could affect the efficiency and decentralization of Bitcoin rollups. In the meantime, we can just leave readers with the following idea: Governance discussions are always difficult ones to have, but I do believe that more of them are warranted when it comes to Bitcoin rollups. The way I see it, it is a typical chicken-and-egg problem: We want to have rollups to scale and bring new functionality to Bitcoin. The only way to have them now is by reactivating OP_CAT, but OP_CAT enables other things that are not necessary for rollups while being inefficient at verifying zero-knowledge proofs. Should we prove the demand for optimistic rollups without a new op_code first, then activate a dedicated op_code to optimize them? Or should we activate OP_CAT first to prove the demand for rollups at the risk of them being inefficient, which could turn users away from them? We do not have the answer to this question but we can only hope that rollup teams will come up with an answer by the end of the year. In the meantime, other covenant proposals such as LNHANCE (including CTV) or TX_HASH could help Bitcoin to scale outside or rollups.    The Thesis for Bitcoin Rollups and Bridge Innovation In this new landscape of Bitcoin L2s, the competition between sidechains and rollups will be fierce. As we’ve outlined, a common misconception within the space is that sidechains are not interesting because they are more centralized than L2s and that rollups are just a new form of sidechains. For sidechains, the bullish case is that bringing EVM compatibility to the Bitcoin ecosystem will spark the resurgence of defi activity for Bitcoiners in search of yield opportunities. As a reminder, over $9.3 billion is currently locked in WBTC according to DeFillama. Bringing this activity back to more Bitcoin-native solutions is imperative if Bitcoin is ever to succeed as a settlement chain for economic activity. Furthermore, we believe that the innovations brought by new sidechain designs can help to mitigate some of the centralizing issues plaguing previous designs. Both Optimized and Reinforced Bridge designs have interesting value propositions that could convince enough users and institutions to participate in these ecosystems. When talking about Bitcoin sidechains, we have to remember that their primary goal remains disintermediated economic activity, not censorship resistance for peer-to-peer cash. As such, participants in those networks will have different priorities, with economic incentives being at the top of the list. For rollups, the innovation of BitVM can bring them very close to actual Bitcoin L2s, with trust minimization at the core of their designs. Sure, rollups on Bitcoin will have a ton of challenges to overcome, but they are being built in the true spirit of Bitcoin cypherpunks. Teams leveraging zero-knowledge-proofs represent an invaluable opportunity for Bitcoin to increase its scalability while preserving privacy and cryptographic security. The reason why it can be hard for critics to see value in these innovations is what we’re calling the “low fee rate bias.” For years now, bitcoin fees have been artificially low because its adoption has been slowed down by speculation and usage of off-chain exchanges to settle transactions. However, this bias will rapidly disappear once fees become unbearably high for most users. This is when the panic will hit, and when the limitations on the base chain will start to become obvious. When this moment happens, we expect sidechains and rollups to become immediate successes as users rush for the exits. In his piece titled “The bridge race is on. Godspeed my friends,” Janusz from Bitcoin Layers correctly outlines that sidechains and rollups are now in a race — a race for dominance of all of the capturable capital either sitting in Bitcoin wallets or altcoin protocols. “Thus, I’m at least concluding that, based on our research of sidechains and L2s, Bitcoin benefits from conversations related to improved bridging mechanisms. I believe that the most successful Bitcoin L2s, long-term, will either be supported by a variation of BitVM2, proposed opcode changes, or a combination of both. A takeaway I had from Nashville is that these systems may even be complimentary.”The rise of sidechains is only a consequence of projects trying to front-run what is shaping up to be the biggest narrative for Bitcoin in the coming years. A new narrative that will be accompanied by billions of dollars in new capital is looking to find attractive opportunities within the most secured and largest digital asset — bitcoin. Revolutions are messy, chaotic, and by definition, they tend to surprise the people who are the least expecting it. The L2 revolution on Bitcoin follows the same path. It might be hard to make sense of everything that has been happening, however, the direction of this revolution has never been clearer. We are heading for the next step in the journey toward hyperbitcoinization.

The hackers are using advanced social engineering techniques to breach the security of companies associated with these financial products, the FBI stated.   According to the FBI, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has been conducting highly targeted social engineering attacks on employees within the decentralized finance (DeFi) and cryptocurrency industries. These attacks involve detailed pre-operational research and customized scenarios designed to exploit the victim's specific interests and connections.""North Korean malicious cyber actors conducted research on a variety of targets connected to cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (s) over the last several months,"" the FBI said. ""This research included pre-operational preparations suggesting North Korean actors may attempt malicious cyber activities against companies associated with cryptocurrency ETFs or other cryptocurrency-related financial products.""The FBI emphasized that North Korean cyber actors are a persistent threat to organizations managing large quantities of cryptocurrency. Their tactics include impersonating trusted contacts, creating fake scenarios involving job offers or investments, and deploying malware through prolonged and convincing interactions with their targets.The agency urged businesses in the cryptocurrency sector to adopt stringent security measures, including multi-factor authentication, limiting access to sensitive information, and verifying the identities of contacts through multiple channels. The FBI also recommended that companies with access to significant cryptocurrency holdings take extra precautions to safeguard their assets against these sophisticated cyber threats."
Bitcoin Magazine,"Privacy and Pain: Craig Raw, Creator Of Sparrow Wallet, On Self-Custody","Tue, 03 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/privacy-and-pain-craig-raw-creator-of-sparrow-wallet-on-self-custody,"An interview with Craig Raw, creator of the popular Sparrow Wallet, on Bitcoin privacy best practices and pain as a teacher. From ""The Privacy Issue"".","This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine's ""The Privacy Issue"". Subscribe to receive your copy.When Craig Raw talks, you listen.His deep voice has a gravity to it, bolstering the urgency of the points he makes.It’s like that voice in the back of your head that you hear when you’ve left too much bitcoin on an exchange for too long. Or that voice that persists when your bitcoin stash isn’t quite as secure as you know it could be.It’s an uncompromised voice, constantly reminding you to follow best practices when it comes to storing and using your bitcoin.Weeks after interviewing Raw — creator of let Sparrow Wallet, a free and open-source Bitcoin desktop wallet beloved by Bitcoin enthusiasts worldwide — for this piece, both the tone of his voice as well as what he shared with me in our interview are still fresh in my mind.He’s concerned that the rhetoric around the importance of privacy and self-sovereignty as it pertains to Bitcoin is eroding and wants to remind you that both of these concepts are of the utmost importance as we move into an era where more and more bitcoin is KYC’d and/or held custodied within walled gardens (e.g., spot bitcoin ETFs).So, if privacy and self-sovereignty mean something to you, please heed Raw’s words. Learn from the tips he shares, highlighted in this piece, as well from simply using and (carefully) experimenting with Sparrow Wallet.If you choose not to, you may end up experiencing a certain pain, which, while it may be a good teacher, would otherwise have been avoidable.PRIVACYWhen it comes to storing and using your bitcoin privately, it’s important to start with the basics, according to Raw.“The first thing is to try and understand what Bitcoin is — to try and understand the UTXO model,” Raw told Bitcoin Magazine.“Try and understand the ways in which you can be more private without using any particular kinds of privacy tools,” he added.He went on to provide two examples of how to do this:Example 1: Don’t Reuse Addresses“Address reuse is unnecessary and generally is [a] very, very poor [practice],” warned Raw. “It leads to transactions being correlated on-chain.”Example 2: Don’t Use Rounded Amounts“If you create a transaction and your amount is a round number, then there’s a change output and it’s very easy to see which is which,” he explained.To expand on what Raw means in this second example, when you spend an uneven amount of bitcoin (e.g., 0.0010126 BTC), it’s more difficult for someone watching the blockchain to decipher which UTXO is the payment and which is the change. This makes it more challenging for the observer to follow your UTXO into the future.The inverse is true if you spend an even amount of bitcoin (e.g., 0.001 BTC). The observer can more easily intuit which UTXO is the payment and which is the change.Both reusing addresses and using rounded amounts are “common pitfalls that people don’t necessarily consider,” said Raw.In addition to employing these two practices, you can use Sparrow Wallet to further increase their privacy.“Sparrow offers two forms of transactions,” explained Raw. “You can either use the efficiency form, which minimizes fees, or you can use the privacy form, which constructs what we call a ‘fake two person coinjoin.’”Raw on Sparrow Wallet’s privacy form transactions:“The privacy form is a more complex transaction where it looks like you could have two people bringing funds into a transaction and then two outputs of the same amount. Anyone looking at that is looking at a transaction with more entropy, with more confusion in it. Even if you know that it's a fake two-person coinjoin, you still have to follow both of those two outputs if you're trying to follow a change of ownership flow in that transaction graph. So, that's more expensive, but it's a useful way to be able to create a more private transaction.”But what about those who don’t want to bother with UTXO management? Isn’t it just easier to use hardware wallet interfaces like Ledger Live or Trezor Suite that handle UTXO management for you?Raw seemed unaffected as I played the role of devil’s advocate in posing these two questions. He made the case in his gravelly voice that users sacrifice privacy, or their funds, when they neglect UTXO management.“You can't really abstract yourself away from the complexity of what Bitcoin is,” posited Raw. “If you want to transact on Bitcoin, you’re going to need to, at some stage, be aware of what you're doing. Otherwise, you’re likely to lose your funds or destroy whatever privacy you have.”He went on to share that wallets with simplistic interfaces that display your Bitcoin balance as if it were a bank account balance are doing a disservice to the user.“The wallet is handling a lot of the detail for you underneath,” shared Raw. “And it simply doesn’t know — it cannot know — the right decisions to make.”Raw then contextualized this statement, highlighting the fact that certain wallets don’t know the right decisions to make IF you’re looking to preserve privacy in your transactions.“If you received some funds from somewhere and then you spent those funds somewhere else, you are creating a cryptographic link on the chain which anyone can see,” he explained. “If somebody knows the identity of either of those two sides, they can start to link things up. That is a dangerous thing that I don't think people are aware of.”He likened this scenario to all of your text messages suddenly becoming public — with your name linked to them.“It’s like if we all had our chat apps and everybody could see everything everyone said and associate an identity to it,” Raw explained. “What we're talking about is the same thing, but on a financial level.”Raw doesn’t think most Bitcoin users are ready for this level of transparency.He believes people should consider whether or not they’re comfortable with publicly broadcasting information that can lead others inferring what they earn or with whom they transact. If they’re not, then they might consider taking UTXO management more seriously with the help of Sparrow Wallet, which displays users’ UTXOs by default instead of hiding them.“Sparrow is trying to give users an ability to understand what it is that they are doing, to be more safe in their transactions from a security and privacy point of view by giving them the information that they need in order to be able to manage that kind of thing.”One of the most refreshing things about Raw is that he doesn’t underestimate Bitcoin users. He seems to think of them as both capable and willing to learn, which is, in part, driven by the fact that we all value our privacy — whether we’re conscious of it or not.“Even those who say, ‘I don't need to be private’ [might change their mind] if they just spent a moment considering that they wouldn’t like their bank accounts or their email inbox and so forth to be open to everyone in the world. And that is effectively what we have with an open blockchain,” explained Raw.“I don't think it is nearly well understood enough, even amongst Bitcoiners, exactly how open and transparent the blockchain is,” he added.“They may not have privacy from their bank or their government today, but they certainly have privacy from other individuals.”THE THREAT TO PRIVACYWhile neglecting UTXO management is a threat to privacy, it’s not the threat to privacy, according to Raw. The threat, said Raw, is the ability — and desire — of Bitcoin users to self-custody their bitcoin.To illustrate how dangerous giving up custody of your bitcoin is, Raw provided a theoretical example of what relinquishing self-custody would look like if taken to the extreme:“Let’s say we have one bank in the world and that bank says, ‘Give me your bitcoin and I will give you an IOU.’ In that situation where everyone transfers their bitcoin over to that bank and the bank issues IOUs, the bank effectively has carte blanche to issue as many IOUs as they want. We’re effectively then back in the fiat world, even if we have bitcoin. I think that that's the biggest risk that Bitcoin faces today — the desire for people to self-custody the funds that they have.”Does this mean that if you use a custodial bitcoin platform for even a second, you’ve betrayed a core Bitcoin tenet and should be excommunicated from the Church of Bitcoin Maximalism?No.At least not in Raw’s estimation.“I think we just need to be very careful about relinquishing too many of those original ideals,” said Raw about ideals like oft-cited ‘not your keys, not your coins.’”At the same time, Raw believes that “Bitcoin doesn’t exist in a vacuum” and that it’s the “product of the environment in which we live today.”He shared that Wallet of Satoshi, a custodial Bitcoin Lightning wallet, has been a useful tool for the Bitcoin Ekasi project — a circular Bitcoin economy based in Raw’s home country of South Africa.While Raw admitted that Wallet of Satoshi is “obviously not ideal from a self-custody point of view,” he also shared that “it does nevertheless get people used to [using bitcoin], and there’s something powerful about that.”Raw seemed less concerned with the idea that people would use Wallet of Satoshi for small, everyday transactions and more concerned with the idea that many stop after downloading and using a custodial app like Wallet of Satoshi and don’t get around to learning about self-custody.Like many of us who’ve tried to onboard friends and loved ones to Bitcoin, stressing to them the importance of holding one’s own keys, Raw gets that many unfortunately still don’t get it, partially because many have yet to feel the pronounced sting of currency debasement.“We clearly get the pushback of ‘Why should I care? Why should this matter to me?,’” said Raw.The idea of having to exit the traditional monetary or financial system in efforts to preserve your wealth “doesn't seem very real” to many around the world, he argued.But for those who’ve lived in highly inflationary environments, learning how to properly use bitcoin isn’t a cognitive exercise — it’s something they resort to instinctively.“If your currency gets devalued by 25% overnight, then it really does become quite material to you to think ‘How do I protect myself against this?,’ Raw added.This is why Raw advises people to learn best practices when it comes to using Bitcoin before they’re thrown into a scenario in which they have to start using it. He makes this case despite the fact that he understands quite well that the greatest Bitcoin teacher is not a person or a certain class, but a feeling that we all often do our best to avoid: pain.PAIN“Maybe they start with the Wallet of Satoshi, and maybe, if the worst comes to worst, that particular service goes away,” theorized Raw.“They lose their funds, they have a painful lesson, and then they look for something better in future. I'm sure you are familiar with that journey. [Author’s note: Of course I am.] Many of the people I'm sure you have spoken to have lost funds and have learned painful lessons along the way [Author’s note: Of course they are. Many have told me this directly.],” he added.“What’s interesting, I find, is they often don't walk away for good. They come back; they try again. They try with those learnings that they've managed to gain.”So, does Raw wish this pain on people? I didn’t get that impression.He’s not cruel; he’s concerned.He also comes off as more of a realist than an idealist.And he thinks that pain will not only compel people to be more careful about how they store the private keys but about how private they keep their transactions, as well.“We don't have nearly enough focus on public opinion behind privacy, and I think the only way we're going to get there is, as is often said in the space, from people touching the stove,” said Raw.“We need that collective pain — unfortunately. I wish it weren't so, but unfortunately, I think it is necessary in order for people to take the idea of privacy seriously,” he added.Raw went on to share that he believes that collective pain is coming and that it’s likely necessary for us as a society to truly recognize just how much we value privacy — a cornerstone of civil society.“Without the ability to be private, we cannot have a free society. It is simply not possible,” deadpanned Raw. “So, if people want to be free, and I believe that, in general, that is true, then they will need to realize at some point that they need this concept of privacy and the ability to have it in their own lives in order to achieve that goal.”The good news is that while this wave of collective pain may wash over society, you can do something to insulate yourself from it. You can download Sparrow Wallet after you finish reading this article and begin to work through some of the discomfort that comes with learning to use new technology — which will likely be less painful than having your financial information doxxed.The Less Painful PathLuckily for us, Raw designed Sparrow to be intuitive, leading more curious users down a path that educates them if they’re willing to spend some time tinkering with the software.“Sparrow was always designed to be not just a Bitcoin wallet but an educator, as well,” explained Raw.“That's why I've tried to put as much detail as I can into it. I designed it in a way, and I hope I've got this right, that gradually reveals information to people who want to dig deeper into things,” he added.“You can use Sparrow in a fairly light way, and you should when you're just getting into it. But, as time goes on, there's no harm in clicking or hovering over things, reading the tool tips, and trying to understand more about what you're doing.”What’s perhaps most remarkable about what Raw has built is that he’s created it and given it to the world for free. Raw doesn’t monetize Sparrow Wallet. As mentioned earlier, it’s free and open-source software that he continues to iterate upon for no reason other than he “believe[s] that it has some value.”For someone who realizes just how much is at stake in a world where the powers that be are trying their best to trap us in a panopticon, Raw’s work keeps him optimistic.“Ultimately it comes down to, for me, the simple idea that Bitcoin is hope,” Raw concluded, with his stern voice softened for just a moment.“What is hope? Hope is the idea that tomorrow can be better than today, that one can look forward to something. Bitcoin represents that. That's why it’s the key driving force above everything else to me.”Download Sparrow Wallet: https://sparrowwallet.com/download/Questions From The Plebs:The following questions were crowdsourced from X.Will you ever create a Sparrow mobile app?The desktop computer is the most capable device that many people have when they are looking to do self-custody of their funds. That's really what Sparrow is for.When it comes to the real important self-custody operations, you want to use the most capable device that you own. It gives you the most screen real estate to display the full context of what you're trying to do.There's a limitation on mobile devices, which is natural just due to the size of the screen. You can see the obvious difference if you are using a mobile app versus using something like Sparrow. There's a big difference in terms of the amount of information that you can show. So, for me, it was natural to want to focus on the desktop.I think that there are pros and cons in terms of security on both. Personally, I believe that the desktop can be made a more secure device than the phone. Again, I recognize that there are certain times when that isn't true, but in general, I think it's true. That's the most important thing.The decisions you make at the start of a project echo throughout its life. It's really important to make good architectural decisions at the very start because that will inform everything further down the road.Is using ecash created from protocols like Cashu and Fedimint a good way to preserve transaction privacy?It's too early to say. If you're talking about a project that hasn't really even reached a meaningful production level yet, it's just really too early to say. They haven't been put to the test.They’re certainly interesting. I think really from a technological point of view, there's a lot of positive things to be said, but from an actual implementation and a regulatory point of view, they haven't been put to the test yet. We'll just have to see.I will obviously keep an eye on all of those things, but I think people should treat any new technology with a great deal of caution before they trust any significant amount of funds to it.Will you ever integrate Lightning into Sparrow Wallet?The best I can say is not at this time. I'm really focused on the ideal of financial self-sovereignty and that's really, at this stage anyway, on the sort of on-chain level.Now, there might be a time in the future where, for example, fees are too high and it's not practical to do that anymore. We simply don't know the way that things are going to play out.Right now, Sparrow is a desktop app. It's a client app. It's not designed to be a server. It's not designed to be run all the time.If you’re trying to design something for Lightning, you very quickly run into this idea of needing to be online to receive funds. As soon as you start to work with that requirement, you get into a lot of complexity around “Am I online? What happens if I’m not online? Do I then need a third party involved?”As I said, the decisions you make at the start of a project echo through its life. Sparrow is good at what it does. It's an app that is designed for self-custody, for cold storage, and the important thing about cold storage is that it should be cold. You shouldn't be necessarily running your cold storage wallet open on Sparrow all the time. That wallet should be closed, and you should be able to close Sparrow, as well.So, as soon as you start to move away from those key goals, you're trying to find some kind of compromise, and that needs to be treated with a lot of caution because it's a different thing than what I'm building today."
Bitcoin Magazine,Relai’s Bitcoin Mission: Bringing Europeans the Orange Coin Despite the Red Tape,"Tue, 03 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/relais-bitcoin-mission-bringing-europeans-the-orange-coin-despite-the-red-tape,"Relai co-founder and CEO Julian Liniger wants to onboard as many EU and UK citizens as possible to Bitcoin, even if that means having to jump through regulatory hoops.","Company Name: RelaiFounders: Julian Liniger and Adem BilicanDate Founded: July 2020Location of Headquarters: Zurich, SwitzerlandAmount of Bitcoin Held in Treasury: One-third of Relai’s treasuryNumber of Employees: 30Website: https://relai.app/Public or Private? PrivateJulian Liniger is on a mission to give more Europeans exposure to Bitcoin — despite regulatory bodies making it more difficult for Bitcoin businesses like the company he co-founded, Relai, to operate on the continent.Liniger, a clean-cut Swiss entrepreneur who was one of Forbes’ 30 Under 30 in 2022, believes that there is much work to be done in bringing bitcoin to Europeans, even if new regulatory regimes like Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) create more red tape around serving EU and UK citizens.“We are working to make Bitcoin more accessible, easier to use and easier to buy for normal people,” Liniger told Bitcoin Magazine.“We're mainly targeting newcomers — the 90% of the people that don't have easy access to bitcoin yet or that just haven't tried yet because they were also not educated yet. In Europe, around 8% to 10% of people have bitcoin and 90% still don't,” he added.To reach this 90%, Liniger and the team at Relai have had to obtain the proper licenses and follow certain regulatory procedures, like requiring that customers complete Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures in order to use the app. Keeping Relai compliant is a tedious process, but Liniger, Libertarian-minded yet pragmatic, sees it as a necessary evil.“I try to build the best company and onboard as many people as possible to Bitcoin in the most Bitcoiner way possible, which is certainly self-custodial and Bitcoin only, but we also need to stay in the realm of what is legal,” Liniger explained.“So, we adhere to these regulations, whether I as an individual like it or not. As a business person, I need to make these decisions,” he added.Wise words from someone who’s no stranger to taking the hard road.The Road To RelaiLiniger was first introduced to bitcoin and cryptocurrency in 2015 and quickly went down the broader crypto rabbit hole.In his early 20s, he watched bitcoin’s price skyrocket from $1,000 to $20,000 and experienced the Ethereum ICO boom from up close as he spent a portion of 2017 in San Francisco, then a hotbed for crypto developer activity, on an exchange semester while pursuing his master’s degree in business administration (MBA).Upon returning home to Switzerland in 2018, he turned down a well-paid consulting job in the world of traditional finance and instead founded Bravis, a crypto consulting firm. During this time, he helped banks prepare to offer Bitcoin services.“[We] helped them to position strategically in this new world and also to conceptualize some products, like actually starting to offer Bitcoin custody, trading, etc., which was inconceivable back then,” said Liniger. “Now, a lot of Swiss banks are doing it.”By 2019, Liniger’s entrepreneurial drive had kicked into a new gear. He wanted to build something bigger than a consulting firm. This urge coincided with his personally adopting a bitcoin-not-crypto investment thesis and realizing that no app in the Swiss or broader European market allowed users to buy, non-custodially hold, and use bitcoin (all of which Relai does).That same year, Liniger and his soon-to-be co-founder at Relai, Adem Bilican, participated in a hackathon and made it into the finals with their concept for the company. By 2020, the two had built a prototype and had raised money from two angel investors. By summer of that year, the Relai app went live with the intention of first providing access to bitcoin and then offering other crypto assets.The Bitcoin community didn’t like the latter notion, though.Bitcoin OnlyLiniger recalled introducing Relai’s promo phrase “easy crypto investing” and the instant backlash it drew from Bitcoiners.“They were like ‘Why crypto? Just stick to Bitcoin and make it really great,’” said Liniger, adding that Relai’s users urged him and his partner to simply make the app as easy-to-use as possible and to incorporate then-new Bitcoin technology like Lightning, both of which Relai have done.Liniger, who’d first conceptualized Relai as a Bitcoin-first crypto app, made the decision to make it a Bitcoin-only app.“[I thought] it wouldn’t hurt to also have a couple other [cryptos],” recalled Liniger.“But then I realized it actually would hurt. All the other [cryptos] don't make sense in the long run if you want to be a savings app. Bitcoin is a savings technology; it's digital gold,” he added, noting that other crypto assets neither purport to be or act as a store of value. Liniger also noted that by 2020, both Bitcoin-only venture capital firms and more Bitcoin-only companies were beginning to arise, and he felt that Relai could be a part of this trend.“We had River in the US, Bull Bitcoin in Canada, etc, and we were thinking we could be the leader of this category in Europe,” said Liniger.Developing A European User BaseBased in Switzerland, Liniger and the Relai team had a leg up on the rest of Europe, as regulations in Switzerland are a bit more relaxed than those in the European Union. Liniger, however, did not want to just serve Swiss citizens for two reasons.The first is that the percentage of Swiss citizens that own bitcoin is closer to 20%, according to Liniger, as compared to the 10% or so of Europeans from other countries. There’s less of a market for those who are new to Bitcoin to go after in Switzerland as compared to those living in the EU and UK.The second reason is that Switzerland’s population is about 8.7 million, whereas the total population of the EU plus UK is over 500 million.In the past four years, Relai has acquired 120,000 users across the continent and Liniger says the growth curve is accelerating even as the company faces certain regulatory impediments.“We are not currently allowed to actively acquire users in the EU for regulatory reasons,” explained Liniger. “We can do active marketing tactics in Switzerland, but not in all the EU countries.”Even in the absence of marketing, Relai continues to grow its user base, especially in Germany, Italy and France.The number of Relai users in these countries will likely continue to grow rapidly as the company is in the process of obtaining licensing from France that will allow the company to advertise to EU customers.“Probably by the end of this year, we will get the French license approval,” said Liniger. “Then, at the beginning of next year, there's going to be MiCA and this [French license] is going to transition into a MiCA license, which will then allow us to actively acquire customers in all the EU.”Once this happens, Liniger believes that upwards of 90% of bitcoin purchases in the EU and UK will happen via Relai.The Cost Of ComplianceWhile Liniger, notably calm and level-headed, talks about the process of overcoming regulatory hurdles, one can’t help but imagine how frustrating the process has been for him and his team.He stated that regulatory bodies and requirements have become significantly more intrusive for not only startups like Relai, but established financial institutions, as well.“I heard stories from our CFO who used to work at ING, a huge bank, four or five years ago,” shared Liniger. “He was in one of these risk management compliance departments, which, when he joined, was like three or four people and the team has 10x’d in the four or five years since.”Liniger went on to explain that many of Relai’s peers have up to a third of their team focused on regulatory compliance.While he’s hopeful that the likes of Coinbase and Kraken fighting the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in court will set some sort of precedent that will get regulators to back off, he doesn’t see the trend of regulatory overreach reversing just yet, which seems slightly worrisome to him.“We don't have these resources at all,” said Liniger, comparing Relai’s funds to the type of money that Coinbase and Kraken have in their coffers to fight regulators in court.This is part of the reason Relai didn’t fight back in court when regulators told them they had to KYC all of their customers.KYC Required, But Do Not DespairRelai recently announced that all users would have to provide their personal information by October 31, 2024 to continue using the app, after four years of being able to offer services without requiring users to do so.“We were just basically forced to by the EU regulators and, increasingly, also from the Swiss regulators,” said Liniger in regard to having to make customers complete the KYC process. “The EU is pressuring Switzerland.”While Liniger didn’t sound particularly happy about this, he also didn’t sound defeated. Instead, he seemed as focused as ever on his mission to bring bitcoin to the 90% of EU and UK citizens who still don’t have any.“50% plus of the people will want some access to Bitcoin just because it’s a savings technology,” explained Liniger, which means he still has about 200 million customers (a 170x of Relai’s current users base) to reach in the broader jurisdiction Relai serves.Admittedly, he knows some of these potential customers will opt to buy bitcoin or bitcoin ETFs that major financial institutions custody for them instead of using Relai, though he believes that the youth, who are more distrusting of established financial institutions, will opt to use Relai.“The more progressive younger people will want to take custody themselves,” explained Liniger. “They will use something like Relai where they can buy directly into self custody and set up a savings plan, using it as a sovereign way of saving their money and their purchasing power into the future.”"
Bitcoin Magazine,Why The DNC Doesn't Care About Bitcoin,"Tue, 03 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/why-the-dnc-doesnt-care-about-bitcoin,"Politicians cater to their voting base, it's that simple. If you want politicians to care about Bitcoin, their voters need to care.","Two weeks ago I attended the Democratic National Convention. The chief reason I did so was to try and encourage an impartiality to our coverage of politics as it relates to the election and Bitcoin here at Bitcoin Magazine. Earlier this year we were invited the the Republican National Convention at the last minute, after David Bailey’s coordination with the Trump campaign began preceding his speaking at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville in July. It bothered me to see people associated with this company taking such a one-sided stand with the Republican Party, despite the reality that in fact many more Republican politicians support Bitcoin compared to Democrats. The Republican Party even formally integrated Bitcoin into their public policy platform at the convention. The Democrats have not. That is not to say that no Democrats support Bitcoin. At the national level Representative Ro Khanna from California, Ritchie Torres from New York, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand also from New York have been vocal supporters of Bitcoin in Congress. These politicians exist, they are vocal, but they do not seem to have the same resonance with the rest of the party or their voting base that exists in the Republican Party. During the first day that I attended, Bitcoin was not mentioned a single time. It wasn’t a very prominent topic at the RNC, but it was mentioned. It was included in the party policy platform. No such inclusion took place at the DNC. The focus of the first day was on the coming election, Kamala versus Trump. I do have to say that not much of the discussion centered around policy. It was mostly rhetorical, and focused on general issues concerning Democratic voters, interspersed with the type of rah-rah language one would expect at an event focused on candidate selection for the Democrat party this election cycle. While no policies explicitly were touched on, many of the issues that Democrats find important were. Minority inclusion, women’s rights, well paying jobs and union security, healthcare (especially as it relates to Covid which is still circulating even though people don’t place the same focus on it), and the perceived attempt by Republicans to roll back progress from the point of view of Democrats on many of these issues. A number of union leaders spoke either in person or with recorded messages during the convention’s first day, the Arizona Pipefitters and Pumbers Union, the Communications Workers of America Union (CWA), International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), the American Federation of State, County, and Munipical Employees (AFSCME). All of them had much to say on the topic of lost jobs during Covid, and the recovery of jobs that took place under the Biden Administration. Another big issue was union pension funds. Union jobs are generally sought, and coveted, due to the benefits and retirement security that comes along with them, not simply the good base pay. Is anything standing out to you? Maybe the fact that Bitcoin actually can synergize and help advance these goals that Democrats seem to care about? Bitcoin can absolutely help minorities suffering economically, at least over long time horizons. Ignoring the aberration of this current market cycle, people holding bitcoin over long time periods have absolutely benefited from increased purchasing power. While obviously it takes money to make money, and people starting with less will realize less in terms of appreciation, anyone with money to save has historically in the long term wound up with more purchasing power. This won’t help people in poverty as much as those with a large surplus of money to invest, but it will help. Bitcoin can also assist women in maintaining access to healthcare that is increasingly being banned in parts of the US. Financial institutions have increasingly been censoring financial transactions deemed troublesome culturally, despite their legal status. There is no reason to assume that this activity will continue only affecting people on the right side of the political spectrum. Bitcoin is an alternative to traditional financial institutions. And I shouldn’t need to tell people that it can function even for services that are outright deemed illegal. Pension funds for workers have also recently started taking conservative exposure to bitcoin, which again looking at historical long term performance can be a huge benefit to solvency issues in the long term facing pensions all over the country. Bitcoin can even be a massive boon to renewable energy, something liberals care very deeply about as it relates to mitigating the consequences of global climate change and maintaining our natural environment. Bitcoin miners are in a very unique position, with AI operators only recently starting to fill a similar niche, to be buyers of stranded renewable energy before it becomes connected to the grid. This allows revenue the instant these projects are finished, rather than having to wait to be connected to retail energy consumers on the grid. That is to say nothing about the general open access nature of Bitcoin, and how it can advance the philosophy of freedom and inclusion globally by providing people with an option in the face of fighting and resisting totalitarian regimes worldwide. Bitcoin is a natural fit for many of the proclaimed beliefs and principles of Democrats. So why is there no attention from the Party at large? Why is there no mention or inclusion in their policy platform similar to Republicans? It’s the base. The recent American Bitcoin Survey by the Nakamoto Project showed us that bitcoin ownership is a bipartisan thing, that it is not concentrated on the right as is generally perceived in the public. So why does that perception continue to exist? Narratives. Stories. Messaging. The reason the Democratic Party does not care as widely about Bitcoin as a policy issue isn’t because Democrats and liberals don’t use it or hold it, it is because of the wider narratives. The perception is that Bitcoin is a rightwing thing. The associations made between Bitcoin and important issues come across as rightwing. Democratic politicians at large are not going to care about Bitcoin in terms of policy, and cater to Bitcoiners with positive policy, unless those narratives and associations change. This is the reality of politics, politicians cater to their voters. They do not generally take forward thinking initiatives on their own unless they see some benefit in terms of positive voter reaction and perception towards that initiative. This is politics. Shouting at politicians won’t change that, demonizing them for apathetic or negative reactionary responses to the perception of it being rightwing in a polarized political climate won’t change that. You need to reach the voting base. That is the only thing that will cause a change in attitude and action on the part of Democratic politicians. People who are on the left need to be shown that Bitcoin is something that aligns with and can advance their political goals and agendas, the same way that wider perception has been propagated on the right. It will definitely be an uphill battle given the baggage of past and existing perception, but this is the only way that the increasingly cemented perception of Bitcoin being a rightwing thing can be pushed back against. Without concerted effort to demonstrate and build narratives showing left leaning people that Bitcoin can, and does, align with their values, Bitcoin is doomed to be forced into a left/right partisan paradigm. "
Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Hashrate Records New ATH Surpassing 740 EH/s,"Tue, 03 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-hashrate-records-new-ath-surpassing-740-eh-s,"The Bitcoin network hashrate hit a new all-time high of 746 EH/s on September 3rd, showcasing improved security and fundamentals. This comes as Bitcoin prices decline, underscoring the disconnect between short-term pricing and long-term network health.","The Bitcoin network hash rate reached a new all-time high on September 3rd, surpassing 740 exahashes per second (EH/s). This comes even as Bitcoin prices trade below $60,000.JUST IN: #Bitcoin's hash rate hit a new ALL TIME HIGH 🚀 pic.twitter.com/BiLY3pRRIV— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 3, 2024  A higher hash rate reflects more computational resources spent processing transactions and mining new Bitcoin. This is despite Bitcoin sliding over 10% this week, which highlights the disconnect between network fundamentals and short-term pricing.Leading mining companies such as Whatsminer and MicroBT are launching advanced machines to take advantage of the surge in hash rate. Whatsminer has introduced four new mining rigs and a forthcoming solar-powered mining container system. Meanwhile, MicroBT has rolled out its M6XS+ miners, capable of processing between 190 and 450 terahash.Riot Platforms also purchased Block Mining for $92.5 million to enhance its hash rate and broaden its market presence. Additionally, miners are looking into AI integration and potential acquisition opportunities to address persistent identity challenges in the industry.Bitcoin's rising hash rate indicates strong confidence in its long-term sustainability. With significant advancements in mining technology and supportive political conditions enhancing profits, miners are rapidly expanding their infrastructure to handle transactions and secure the Bitcoin network.While the hash rate doesn't directly influence Bitcoin's price, it reinforces the underlying network security. Hashrate milestones also tend to precede bullish market moves and Bitcoin's halving events."
Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoiners and Wobblies: Labor Day Edition,"Mon, 02 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoiners-and-wobblies-labor-day-edition-,"A look at the history of the American and global Labor Movement, and the parallels between Bitcoin's and the labor movement's evolutions. ","Recently, I’ve been reading about the foundations of the American Labor Movement. Specifically, the birth of the Industrial Workers of the World and a group called the Wobblies, a nickname given to IWW Members. At its peak, the IWW had over 150,000 members in 1917, with global memberships and significant power and influence. While the IWW was a socialist leaning organization in theory, many of its core values were intertwined into the DNA of the American Labor movement, and was undeniably pivotal to the development of organized labor and a strong working class following the industrial revolution. The parallels between some of the IWW’s origins and ideologies and Bitcoin are significant, and shall be demonstrated with quotes rather than boring you to death with in depth history.All quotes are attributed to the book “Wobblies: A Graphic History of The Industrial Workers of the World (Buhle/Schulman.Origins and Genesis“No one can say exactly where the inspiration for the IWW came from. The origins are too numerous both in the U.S. and abroad…”Similarly, the nickname of the Wobblies, has no clear origin. Naturally, some of the mythology around Bitcoin comes to mind, and while Bitcoin’s origins are clearly documented via white paper and email communications, its creator or creators is or are shrouded in mystery. As Bitcoin caught gained popularity, its growth was decentralized and organic. In another parallel, while the IWW and American Labor Movement had prior inspirations, it was a pioneer in the sense of organizing labor across ethnic, gender, religious and other demographic differences. “After the Civil War, massive industry grew up faster than anyone could have imagined, with previously unthinkable wealth accruing to the bankers but with millions of desperately poor working people, employed at low wages or unemployed in the frequent economic recessions”From the financial crisis, to post-covid wealth accumulation within the ranks of billionaires, to a current AI, robotics and self-automation boom underway, this story is all too familiar. However, recessions have been all but outlawed, replaced by government intervention, currently placing systems as large as Pensions and Social Security on the equivilant of government welfare and dependence.Wobblies and Bitcoiners“The Wobbly, male or female, Asian or Occidental, black, brown, red or white, was only an ordinary human being in physique”We feel the same about Bitcoiners. We have all met some of the most inspiring people in our lives in this space. It is both the character, grit and determination that allows individuals to discover and understand Bitcoin, as well as the character building journey a Bitcoiner must take to fully grasp Bitcoin and share it with a world that rounds out what many of us believe is the most talented and motivated communities in the world.“Their story was collaborative, collective, not reliant on any one hero or heroine-as heroic (or tragic) as individual Wobblies lives might be.”Kill your heroes. Death to Ego. Bitcoin doesn't need any of us.Solidarity: A movement greater than the individual“The world of the Wobblies was one realized in its best moments by solidarity across race, ethnic, gender and nationality lines”The beauty of Bitcoin is it requires no trust between those who transact with each other. And in doing such, Bitcoin allows humans to deconstruct the daily head to toe analysis we perform on each other daily; an analysis that instinctually calls out our differences, with roots in paranoia and fear. While blind solidarity amongst Bitcoiners is the antithesis of “dont trust, verify,” there is a strong natural bond between Bitcoiners. I believe the future of Bitcoin, when facing its largest tests ahead, will very much depend upon a deepened solidarity between those who subscribe to Bitcoin’s Genesis, core values, and blind commitment to being honest, true and trustless.AFL vs. Knights of Labor“The earliest mass movement for an eight hour workday during 1885-86, highlighted the different roles of two kinds of labor movements. The American Federation of Labor, founded in 1883, sought to organize skilled workers (almost entirely white and male) only…whereas the Knights of Labor, founded in 1869 as a secret society..extended its membership to almost all workers (except Chinese), including African-Americans and women.”The AFL and its exclusive country club brand of membership outlasted the ultimate demise of the Knights of Labor and still exists today as the AFL-CIO. In reading about the different philosophies of the AFL and Knights of Labor it brings up parallels within the Bitcoin community, frequently heard criticisms of Bitcoin Maxi’s, as well as Bitcoin v. Crypto. I leave you the reader to draw your own thoughts here, as parallels are in their nature loose affiliations at best.The Movement“In the industrially advanced United States, the working class had been prepared ready to assume control of society and to replace “politics” and the “State” with a government of direct rule. As Marx had pointed out about the Paris Commune (and Lenin would repeat for the Soviets), the existing government apparatus could not be infiltrated and taken over piece-meal; it had to be dissolved and repalced by a truly democratic, modern form of government”There are two camps of thought in Bitcoin, one that calls for a full collapse of the current financial system, and migration to a Bitcoin Standard, and another that insists Bitcoin can co-exist with and even surpass the current financial system without the latters' collapse. While money is not identical to government in this parallel, the amount in which money is entrenched in the legacy financial system, is prodigious, and this always sparks interesting debate between Bitcoiners.“For the IWW..the familiar problem of the socialist movement being notoriously small in the US could be solved in a new way. ‘Educating’ workers into becoming socialists, through newspapers, speeches and election campaigns, was too passive and not very successful. Workers needed to educate themselves, in and through their own actions and self-organization.”Some opposing parallels here. Immediately, I think of a core value of Bitcoiners, which is that, no one can walk this path for you. Proof of Work can not be sidestepped or bypassed. No individual or group can cheat the quest for knowledge, both about Bitcoin and the system it sits poised to replace. The Bitcoin journeys of individuals and membership-based orgs, absent continuous learning and education, often end up in loss or disappointment. Those who do the work, find that their knowledge of money blossoms, and few if any have ever turned back after coming to deeply understand Bitcoin.Simultaneously, my mind shifts to the oligarchy’s attempts at no less than a 10 year negative media blitz on all things Bitcoin. It slowed the train but it did not work. The other day, I randomly asked people at the 3rd Street promenade in Santa Monica, to share their thoughts on Bitcoin. Overwhelmingly positive, and having some foundation in accuracy. The movement to dissuade people from finding Bitcoin was a delay of the inevitable at best. Because nothing can stop an idea whose time has come.ConclusionsOn this labor day, I gaze upon the deeply polarized two party political system of the dominant world power today. And as I see labor unions align with one party, at the expense of creating division within their ranks, I see a labor movement that has drifted from its original foundation. While the IWW rose and fell, its pinnacle represented an unwavering movement, a solidarity and commitment to the worker above everything else. And there is power in that. I see parallels today in Bitcoin.The core principles of Bitcoin transcend our differences and are worth fighting for. At Proof of Workforce, our method of fighting for these values is through education-based Bitcoin adoption for workers, unions, pension funds and municipalities. And in doing so, we are sharing not just bitcoin the asset, or Bitcoin the Network, we are communicating the Genesis of Bitcoin and its values, so that they may not be lost in the progression of time.Finally, Bitcoin is a natural evolution of the labor movement, sharing many similarities and parallels. However, unlike the labor movement, the worker can rely on Bitcoin, absent any allegiance to any political party, leader or oligarchy. And in this sense, Bitcoin and its system of values stands to be adopted by unions all over the world. And in doing so, unions around the world can become re-aligned to their Genesis Story. A story where solidarity comes above all, a story where workers come together to hold onto the very productive property dependent upon their labor. A story where, as many workers stand to be phased out of relevance due to automation and AI, the unions representing them look forward and claim ownership of the most accessible and promising productive property available to them today; Bitcoin.This is a guest post by Dom Bei.

In most of these cases, the insinuation that the fighting stage has begun was overblown, however; perhaps inspired by little more than a comment from some politician or finance professional.But on April 24 of this year, the quote finally rang true.On that day, the US Department of Justice (DoJ), via the District Court of the Southern District of New York, announced the indictment of Samourai Wallet co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill. Rodriguez, Samourai Wallet’s CEO who pseudonymously operated the @SamouraiWallet handle on Twitter/X, was arrested early that morning in his home state of Pennsylvania. Hill (AKA TDev, or @SamouraiDev on Twitter), meanwhile, was arrested in Lisbon, Portugal, where he resided; at the time of writing this article, the DoJ intends to extradite him to the US.Both of them are accused of running an unlicensed money transmitter, and earning millions of dollars in fees doing so. For this, Rodriguez and Hill each face a maximum prison sentence of five years.On top of that, the duo was charged with money laundering as well. According to the DoJ, Samourai Wallet was used to launder over $100 million dollars of crime proceeds from dark net markets, fraudulent schemes and other illicit activities. This could add a whopping maximum 20 years to their sentence.Samourai Wallet’s web servers and domain (samourai.io) were also seized, rendering the wallet largely unusable. (Though users could still recover their bitcoin through other wallets, using their backup seeds.)Around the same time as the Samourai Wallet developers’ arrests, the FBI issued a public warning to cryptocurrency users, stating that they may lose their funds due to criminal seizures if they don’t move their holdings to regulated entities. Although Samourai Wallet was not mentioned by the agency, the timing of the note suggests the warning was no coincidence.Together, it seemed to represent a step change for Bitcoin and Bitcoin development.

In a world where money is increasingly going digital, Cypherpunks have since the 1990s attempted to create a form of electronic cash in order to prevent an Orwellian future where every transaction can be monitored and potentially censored. Similarly, Douglas Jackson around the turn of the millennium offered a gold-backed digital payment system with privacy features called eGold, which eventually had to shut down operations because Jackson did not register his company as a money transmitter.eGold required a money transmitter license because it held gold in reserve on behalf of its users, but it has since then generally been assumed that creators of non-custodial wallet software did not qualify as money transmitters. As long as developers never took control of user funds themselves, they did not need to register with the United States Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and therefore also wouldn’t need to apply anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) checks on their users— or so it was thought.Crucially, this assumption was in large part based on guidance from FinCEN itself, published in 2013.By extension, many presumed that developers wouldn’t be held accountable for how their software is used. If non-custodial Bitcoin wallets are used to launder money, those engaged in the activity itself would be breaking the law, but it was generally not believed to be the responsibility of the creators of these wallets to prevent this from happening in the first place.Samourai Wallet was, indeed, a non-custodial wallet. Users stored their own private keys in their wallet software, so Rodriguez or Hill at no point controlled these bitcoin. By default, the Samourai Wallet application did communicate with a central server to send and receive transactions, but even this could be sidestepped by connecting to the Samourai Dojo: a personal, internet-connected device that embedded a Bitcoin node.Importantly, Samourai Wallet was marketed as a privacy wallet, and its main privacy feature—Whirlpool—did fully depend on the Samourai server. Specifically, Samourai Wallet users could, coordinated through this central server, collaborate to make CoinJoin transactions. In groups of five, users would contribute an equal amount of bitcoin (for example 0.01 BTC) to a transaction, which sent back the same amount to each of them.Because there is no way to link specific transaction inputs to specific transaction outputs, this essentially “mixed” their coins. Blockchain analysts would be unable to trace back the history of these coins, except to the extent that they’d know they must have come from one of these five inputs. Furthermore, Whirlpool users could opt to automatically repeat such mixes, even further obfuscating their transaction history.In addition, Samourai Wallet offered a service called Ricochet. This enabled users to send bitcoin to newly generated addresses they controlled themselves multiple times, somewhat frustrating blockchain analysis as well. (Although this is possible with any Bitcoin wallet, Samourai Wallet automated the process.)The allegation, as put forth by the DoJ, is that these tools were, indeed, used to launder money. What’s more, the federal department argues that the Samourai Wallet co-founders intended this to be the case. This accusation is largely based on public as well as private communication about their service, including some statements by Rodriguez and Hill on Twitter and in their pitch decks intended for investors, which mentioned that individuals who engaged in “illicit activity” on “restricted” or “dark/grey” markets would be among their user base.Whether these statements truly indicate that Rodriguez and Hill intended their software to be used for illicit purposes—as opposed to it just being “tough marketing talk” from developers who ultimately wanted to offer financial privacy tools—will have to be proven in court.And perhaps more importantly, the Samourai Wallet arrests challenge the long-standing assumption that developers don’t have to register as money transmitters and perform the associated AML and KYC checks.Though, this assumption had already been put to question in a different corner of the cryptocurrency space…Tornado CashIn August 2022, the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) added Tornado Cash, a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, to its OFAC list. It made interacting with the smart contract illegal under US law.Later that same month, Alexey Pertsev was arrested by the Dutch police. In the years prior, Pertsev had, along with Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, founded and operated software development company PepperSec. Key to their efforts had been the development of Tornado Cash as well as supporting infrastructure.As a smart contract, Tornado Cash technically functions autonomously. Although Pertsev helped develop the tool, it exists across thousands of Ethereum nodes around the world. After it was released, Pertsev had no way to control how it was used, or who used it. Anyone could send an amount of ETH to the smart contract, which—utilizing a cryptographic trick called zero-knowledge proofs—enabled them to withdraw that same amount from the smart contract, but to a different account. Here, too, there was no way to link the ETH going into Tornado Cash to the ETH going out, thus the smart contract essentially functioned as a “mixing” service.To make this feature effective, PepperSec also developed supporting infrastructure, which in part relied on relayers: basically, Ethereum users could be tasked with paying the Tornado Cash fee, for which they in turn were rewarded TORN tokens. This aspect of the design—the relayers and the TORN tokens—centered around a different smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, which technically was implemented as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).In addition to that, PepperSec operated a service that offered an easily accessible graphical user interface (GUI) for the smart contract and its surrounding infrastructure.Importantly, Tornado Cash as well as the supporting infrastructure was all non-custodial software. Pertsev, Storm and Semenov developed code, but they at no point controlled any of the ETH going into the smart contract. Although they couldn’t control how Tornado Cash could be used, it’s less obvious to what extent the same was true for the supporting infrastructure. (Like many things Ethereum, claims of “decentralization” were at least in part grounded in marketing more so than in technical reality.)In either case, for the Dutch prosecutor, the fact that Pertsev and his colleagues never took custody of any ETH did not make much of a difference. In her view, PepperSec was de facto ran as a business, which—albeit indirectly through the TORN token—earned an income from Tornado Cash and the supporting infrastructure. She argued this made Pertsev responsible for how Tornado Cash was used, and by whom.In particular, she pointed out, Tornado Cash had been used to launder well over a billion US dollars, for example by North Korean state-funded hackers known as the Lazarus Group. Pertsev knowingly facilitated this kind of activity through the software he developed, she argued, and did nothing to prevent it. He had to be held accountable.And as it would soon turn out, it wasn’t just the Dutch prosecutor who held this belief. About a year after Pertsev’s arrest in the Netherlands, his PepperSec co-founders Storm and Semenov were indicted in the United States, with the former (who resided in the US) arrested. (Semenov does not live in the United States; at the time of writing this article his whereabouts are unknown, but he is likely in a country without an extradition treaty with the US.)Much like Pertsev, both of them are charged with money laundering, as well as running an unlicensed money transmitter business and sanctions violations. Storm will stand trial in New York this September.Chilling EffectThe various arrests quickly appeared to have a chilling effect on other Bitcoin developers.Even before Pertsev’s arrest, Bitcoin privacy wallet Wasabi Wallet—Samourai Wallet’s main competitor—in March of 2022 decided to implement AML checks in their mixing software, and reject coins that were suspected to have been used for illicit activity. (Although Wasabi Wallet, like Tornado Cash and Samourai Wallet, was fully non-custodial, the company behind the wallet—zkSNACKs—coordinated CoinJoin mixes through a central server.)This new policy was harshly criticized by—among others—the Samourai Wallet team and other privacy focused bitcoiners. Rodriguez and Hill loudly and proudly proclaimed that their mixing service was open for business to anyone, and on social media adopted a much more adversarial attitude towards regulators and their KYC/AML regime. Indeed, it was exactly this attitude that may have gotten them in legal trouble.More recently, the Samourai Wallet arrests moved other Bitcoin developers to take additional precautions as well. Just one day after the indictment, Sparrow Wallet, which had been compatible with Samourai Wallet’s Whirlpool, for example released a new version of its software that disabled this feature. Shortly after, development company ACINQ announced that its Phoenix Wallet (a Lightning wallet) would be removed from US app stores, citing on Twitter that “[r]ecent announcements from US authorities cast a doubt on whether self-custodial wallet providers, Lightning service providers, or even Lightning nodes could be considered Money Services Businesses and be regulated as such.”And in what was arguably the biggest setback for privacy in Bitcoin’s short history, Wasabi Wallet soon after announced to discontinue its mixing service altogether. With Whirlpool already down, the other major CoinJoin coordinator would seize operations per June 1st of this year.The First VerdictJust weeks after the Samourai Wallet developers’ arrest and the events that unfolded immediately after, on May 14th of this year, it was time for Pertsev’s sentencing.In the courthouse of ’s Hertogenbosch, a small city about an hour south of Amsterdam, the Tornado Cash developer received the bad news. The panel of judges essentially agreed with the prosecutor on all counts, and in some ways went even further than the prosecutor was willing to go. The judges ruled that Pertsev was fully responsible for how the smart contract was used; the fact that some of the code that PepperSec produced was “unstoppable”, was not considered a valid excuse.“Tornado Cash functions in the way the defendant and its co-founders developed Tornado Cash,” they stated. “So the operation is completely their responsibility.”Pertsev was sentenced to 64 months in Dutch prison— though he did file for appeal, which at the time of writing is pending.The next Tornado Cash court case will take place in New York, where Pertsev’s PepperSec co-founder Storm will stand trial. While the Dutch verdict should technically not affect the outcome of the American proceedings, the case and sentencing in the Netherlands might offer an indication of what can be expected: the Dutch prosecutors shared many of their files with their American colleagues.Meanwhile, the first hearing for Samourai Wallet’s Rodriguez took place in New York last May as well. He will be awaiting the full trial on home arrest in Pennsylvania.Still, despite these significant setbacks for Bitcoin privacy, the prospects of bitcoin mixing are not altogether dead. Most obviously, all American trials are yet to take place. (And even if Rodriguez, Hill and/or Storm are found guilty, they, too, can appeal to higher courts.) Meanwhile, JoinMarket—a tool that lets users create CoinJoin transactions without a central coordinator—continues operations uninterrupted. And while Wasabi Wallet has taken its central coordinator offline, the wallet itself will still be maintained.What’s more, alternative Wasabi Wallet coordinators have already started offering their services: while not operated by zkSNACKs, this enables users of the wallet to create CoinJoin transactions between them in much the same way. Because such coordinators can even be operated anonymously over Tor, future prosecution of such services may be even harder as well— regardless of the outcome of the upcoming trials.The fighting stage, indeed, has begun— and the fight is far from over. Whether the adage will ring true, and the winning stage follows next, remains to be seen."
Bitcoin Magazine,The Impact of Institutional Investors on Bitcoin,"Fri, 30 Aug 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-impact-of-institutional-investors-on-bitcoin,The Institutional Paradox: How Big Money is Reshaping Bitcoin’s Future,"For years, Bitcoin enthusiasts have been expecting a significant change in the value due to the involvement of institutional investors. The concept was simple: as companies and large financial entities invest in Bitcoin, the market would experience explosive growth and a sustained period of rising prices. However, the actual outcome has been more complex. Although institutions have indeed invested substantial capital in Bitcoin, the anticipated ‘supercycle’ has not unfolded as predicted.Institutional AccumulationInstitutional participation in Bitcoin has significantly increased in recent years, marked by substantial purchases from large companies and the introduction of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) earlier this year.  Figure 1: Bitcoin company treasury holdings. Access Live Chart 🔍  Leading this movement is MicroStrategy, which alone holds over 1% of the total Bitcoin supply. Following MicroStrategy, other prominent players include Marathon Digital, Galaxy Digital, and even Tesla, with significant holdings also found in Canadian firms such as Hut 8 and Hive, as well as international companies like Nexon in Japan and Phoenix Digital Assets in the UK; all of which can be tracked via the new Treasury data charts available on site.  Figure 2: Detailed analysis of BTC treasuries for publicly traded companies. Access Live Chart 🔍  In total, these companies hold over 340,000 bitcoin. However, the real game-changer has been the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs. Since their inception, these financial instruments have attracted billions of dollars in investments, resulting in the accumulation of over 91,000 bitcoin in just a few months. Together, private companies and ETFs control around 1.24 million bitcoin, representing about 6.29% of all circulating bitcoin.A Look at Bitcoin's Recent Price MovementsTo understand the potential future impact of institutional investment, we can look at recent Bitcoin price movements since the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January. At the time, Bitcoin was trading at around $46,000. Although the price dipped shortly after, a classic ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" scenario, the market quickly recovered, and within two months, Bitcoin's price had surged by approximately 60%.  Figure 3: Bitcoin price action following the ETF approvals. Access Live Chart 🔍  This increase correlates with institutional investors' accumulation of Bitcoin through ETFs. If this pattern continues and institutions keep buying at the current or increased pace, we could witness a sustained bullish momentum in Bitcoin prices. The key factor here is the assumption that these institutional players are long-term holders, unlikely to sell off their assets anytime soon. This ongoing accumulation would reduce the liquid supply of Bitcoin, requiring less capital inflow to drive prices even higher.The Money Multiplier Effect: Amplifying the ImpactThe accumulation of assets by institutional players is significant. Its potential impact on the market is even more profound when you consider the money multiplier effect. The principle is straightforward: when a large portion of an asset's supply is removed from active circulation, such as the nearly 75% of supply that hasn’t moved in at least six months as outlined by the HODL Waves, the price of the remaining circulating supply can be more volatile. Each dollar invested has a magnified impact on the overall market cap.  Figure 4: Bitcoin HODL waves outlining the illiquidity of BTC. Access Live Chart 🔍  For Bitcoin, with roughly 25% of its supply being liquid and actively traded, the money multiplier effect can be particularly potent. If we assume this illiquidity results in a $1 market inflow increase in the market cap by $4 (4x money multiplier), institutional ownership of 6.29% of all bitcoin could effectively influence around 25% of the circulating supply.If institutions were to begin offloading their holdings, the market would likely experience a significant downturn. Especially as this would likely trigger retail holders to begin offloading their bitcoin too. Conversely, if these institutions continue to buy, the BTC price could surge dramatically, particularly if they maintain their positions as long-term holders. This dynamic underscores the double-edged nature of institutional involvement in Bitcoin, as it slowly then suddenly possesses a greater influence on the asset.ConclusionInstitutional investment in Bitcoin has both positive and negative aspects. It brings legitimacy and capital that could drive Bitcoin prices to new heights, especially if these entities are committed long term. However, the concentration of Bitcoin in the hands of a few institutions could lead to heightened volatility and significant downside risk if these players decide to exit their positions.For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out a recent YouTube video here:"
Bitcoin Magazine,BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Saw Outflow For the First Time Since May,"Fri, 30 Aug 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-saw-outflow-for-the-first-time-since-may,"BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, saw an outflow of $13.5 million on Thursday, marking the first withdrawal since May 1st amid a third straight day of outflows from Bitcoin ETFs.","BlackRock's spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the iShares Bitcoin Trust, experienced an outflow of $13.5 million on Thursday. This was IBIT's first outflow since May 1st. Thursday's outflow was the second ever for the iShares Bitcoin Trust since its launch in January. The ETF has seen consistent inflows almost daily, cementing itself as a dominant Bitcoin investment product.Prior to Thursday's $13.5 million outflow, the last time the fund saw withdrawals was May 1st when $37 million was pulled out. That coincided with Bitcoin hitting a local low of $56,000.The outflow comes as spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a third straight day of withdrawals totalling $71.8 million on Thursday. Competing Bitcoin ETFs from Grayscale, Fidelity, Valkyrie and Bitwise also posted outflows ranging from $8 million to $31 million.Meanwhile, ARK's Bitcoin ETF saw an inflow of $5.3 million, bucking the negative trend. The mixed flows highlight diverse investor outlooks amid Bitcoin's stagnation under $60,000. BlackRock's IBIT seeing an outflow for the first time in months is a notable development. It might indicate that the bottom is in like the last time, or this might be the start of more outflows. Nonetheless, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF has still attracted a staggering over $20 billion in net inflows over its lifetime. It remains the dominant spot Bitcoin fund with over 350,000 BTC under management, making it one of the largest institutional Bitcoin holders."

Bitcoin Magazine,The Privacy Issue: Letter From the Editors,"Thu, 29 Aug 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/the-privacy-issue-letter-from-the-editors,"Bitcoin is code. Code is speech. And writing code is not a crime. Announcing ""The Privacy Issue"".","Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.Bitcoin finds itself yet again at another crossroad. On one side, the easy road, paved with Number Go Up, highly regulated ETF products, and surveillance state-endorsed stablecoins as the scaling solution for the next billion users. The other path is objectively more difficult to traverse, a darker way forward, despite the illuminating words of Eric Hughes and other pioneers in the field of open source cryptographic tooling. On March 3, 1993, Hughes published A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto, articulating the direction of the recently-formed Cypherpunks: a Bay Area group of hackers and activists composed of Hughes, Tim May, John Gilmore and others under the moniker created by St. Jude Milhon.

We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence. It is to their advantage to speak of us, and we should expect that they will speak.How did we get here? How have we spent the last year arguing about what constitutes spam, and ethical use of Bitcoin, while completely ignoring the overflowing regulatory moat? There were more than enough signs. There were more than enough warnings. Congress is putting together drafted legislation for further internet regulation, stablecoin bills, social media application bans, while the state continues to redefine in real time what a cryptocurrency even is.To try to prevent their speech is to fight against the realities of information. Information does not just want to be free, it longs to be free. Information expands to fill the available storage space. Information is Rumor's younger, stronger cousin; Information is fleeter of foot, has more eyes, knows more, and understands less than Rumor.Bitcoin is a database. Bitcoin is speech. Bitcoin is code. The compliance-driving hypnotists will tell you we must ask permission from our local governing offices for the embrace of bitcoin. So that we can pay our taxes in bitcoin and service our legal debts. Samourai, TornadoCash, Wasabi Wallet… they wrote code. Code that users across the globe, in myriad legal jurisdictions, utilized to exchange alphanumeric strings.People have been defending their own privacy for centuries with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret handshakes, and couriers. The technologies of the past did not allow for strong privacy, but electronic technologies do.Writing code is not a crime. Code is speech. Distributing code is an expression between parties of bytes, reduced to bits, to ones and zeroes. Any precedent that establishes anything other than this is in direct violation of the First Amendment, and furthermore, against the natural code of freedom of expression. Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do, we're going to write it.There are plenty of ways that Bitcoin the network can spread itself across the globe, and how bitcoin the asset can monetize to astronomical heights without bringing an ounce more freedom to the populace of the world. Bitcoin's definition has been gaslit by the hypnotists to be within the purview of the regulatory moat, and thus Bitcoin is in dire need of a redefinition. Bitcoin was never about dollar denominated value, it was never about perpetuating the UST market via Treasury-backed tokens utilized by captured, KYC-demanding on- and off-ramps. Bitcoin was never about embracing the state and the furthering of the reach and influence of the psychopathic criminals obsessed with changing the definition of speech and expression, of code and of numbers. Bitcoin is a tool of empowerment and Bitcoin is for enemies. Well, now our enemy, the state, is empowered.We know that software can't be destroyed and that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down.Writing code is not a crime. We sat and argued over culture signaling with all the class of drunken sport rivals while watching the bookkeepers take their red felt pen to change the meaning of words, slowly bringing the frogs, and their dictionaries, to a boil.Privacy only extends so far as the cooperation of one's fellows in society. We the Cypherpunks seek your questions and your concerns and hope we may engage you so that we do not deceive ourselves. We will not, however, be moved out of our course because some may disagree with our goals.Bitcoin is just a ledger.

Bitcoin Magazine,Proton Wallet Review: A Bitcoin Software Wallet That Simplifies Transactions,"Thu, 29 Aug 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/reviews/proton-wallet-review-a-bitcoin-software-wallet-that-simplifies-transactions,"Proton’s new bitcoin wallet lets users send bitcoin as easily as sending an email, but don’t hold your breath waiting for transactions to settle.","Proton, the Swiss company behind ProtonMail and ProtonVPN, has released a beta version of the newest offering in its suite of products that help to preserve online privacy — Proton Wallet.The wallet is great for those looking to send bitcoin on-chain with relative ease, but it leaves some to be desired for more advanced users or for those who want to make smaller payments quickly and cheaply.Pros And ConsProton Wallet’s standout feature is that it allows you to send bitcoin using nothing more than a recipient’s email address, which doesn’t have to be a ProtonMail address. The non-custodial bitcoin-only wallet is also free to use and has an easy-to-navigate user interface (UI).However, it lacks in that it only allows users to make transactions on the Bitcoin base chain — not over Lightning — which can take upwards of hours to settle, and it doesn't allow users to manage their UTXOs. Plus, it’s a software wallet and cannot be disconnected from the internet like a hardware wallet, which increases the risk of the wallet’s private keys being compromised.Getting Started With Proton WalletTo use the beta version of the product, you need an invitation either from the company or another user. The wallet is currently available via web browser, as an Android app and as a TestFlight version of an Apple app and takes 5 to 10 minutes to set up and begin using.Once you’ve received an email invitation to use the wallet, you can click on the “Start using Proton Wallet” link in the invitation email to get started setting it up. (Email addresses have been blacked out below and throughout this review to preserve privacy.)  Invitation email for Proton Wallet  You’ll be taken to a “wallet setup” page where you’ll simply click a button to get started with Proton Wallet. You won’t be prompted to write down the 12-word seed phrase as you set up the wallet, which was a nice touch by Proton to help users to more simply get started using the wallet. You can write down the seed phrase later if you please, though.  Wallet setup  As you set up the wallet, Proton makes it clear that your Proton Wallet is a non-custodial Bitcoin wallet, which means that managing the wallet is your responsibility and your responsibility alone.  Warning message  The home screen of the wallet is straightforward and incredibly easy to navigate. It’s as pared down so as to include little more than the basics you need to send, receive and buy bitcoin.  Home screen  Depositing Bitcoin In Proton WalletTo begin using the wallet, you’ll first have to deposit some bitcoin. You can deposit bitcoin from another wallet you manage. To do so, you’ll need to copy the bitcoin address by clicking on the “Receive” button on the home screen and then clicking the “Copy Bitcoin address” button in the window that pops up on the right of the screen.  Receiving bitcoin  You’ll copy that address into the proper field from the wallet you're sending it from. It’s good practice to double check that the address you’ve pasted matches the address you’ve copied.  Sending bitcoin from an exchange  The bitcoin won’t appear in your Proton Wallet balance immediately. It usually takes at least a few minutes for the transactions to process, as this depends on how long it takes for block confirmations to occur. Some transactions can take much longer — upwards of hours.You can see that the funds are on their way, though, in the “Transactions” section of the home screen. You’ll continue to see an “In progress” notification until the necessary amount of block confirmations has occurred.  ""In progress"" notification  Buying Bitcoin With Proton WalletIf you don’t have any bitcoin to send to your Proton Wallet, you can also use the wallet to buy some. This process is relatively straightforward.You can click the “Buy” button on the home screen and you’ll be taken to a page that serves as an interface for crypto asset service providers Ramp and Banxa.  Selecting your location  Complete the fields for how much bitcoin you want to purchase, choose whether you want to use Banxa or Ramp and select your payment method.  Selecting your payment method  Instructions from this point vary depending on the payment method you choose.Sending Bitcoin With Proton WalletYou can send bitcoin as simply as clicking the “Send” button on the home screen and then inputting either a bitcoin address or an email address. Note that your recipient doesn’t need a ProtonMail address.I used an email address to send some bitcoin.  Sending bitcoin with an email address  Next, you’ll be taken to an “Amount” page, where you’ll input the amount of bitcoin you’d like to send, denominated either in either a fiat currency or sats.  Selecting the US dollar amount of bitcoin to send  On the “Review” page, you can leave a message for the recipient. It’s optional to do so.On this page, you’ll also be presented with the total amount of your transaction and be given the option to increase or decrease the priority of your transfer.You won’t be presented with the option to select UTXOs to spend, an option that a desktop Bitcoin wallet like Sparrow provides you with.If you’re comfortable with the amount you want to send and the fee, you can click the “Confirm and send” button.  Reviewing transaction details  If you'd like to increase or decrease the speed of your transaction, you can select a higher or lower network fee by clicking the arrow to the right in the ""Network fee"" section of the page.When you do so, a new window will pop up, allowing you to select different network fees.  Selecting a network fee  ""High priority"" transactions process fastest are the most expensive. Transactions via Proton Wallet default to ""Median priority"" if you do not select the level of priority you prefer.You’ll be able to see whether or not your transaction has cleared by looking at the “Transactions” section.In my case, the recipient was notified that the bitcoin was on the way before the transaction received the required number of confirmations on the blockchain.  Transaction details appear at the bottom of the home screen  I sent this transaction with ""Median priority,"" and it took over an hour to complete.Securing Your Proton WalletProton Wallet lets you secure and back up your wallet in different ways.The first level of security for the wallet is the password you use to log in to it, which you create when you set up the wallet.Proton Wallet lets you add a second level of security by offering two-factor authentication (2FA).To set this up, you can click on the “Secure your wallet” tab in the top right hand corner of the home screen. You’ll then be presented with the option to set up 2FA for your wallet.  Securing your wallet  If you want to add 2FA protection to your account, you can click the “Set up 2FA to secure your account” button. When you do so, you’ll be taken to a page on which you can toggle a switch to set up 2FA for the account. If you choose to do this, toggle the “Authenticator app” switch and follow the subsequent instructions.  Enabling 2FA  Backing Up Your Proton WalletProton Wallet allows you to back up your wallet’s seed phrase whenever you’d like. To do so, you can click on “Backup this wallet’s seed phrase” on the home screen.You’ll then be taken to a screen that explains what a seed phrase is and why it’s important to safely back it up. Click the “View wallet seed phrase” button to view the seed phrase for your wallet.It’s best practice to store your seed phrase offline (e.g., written on a piece of paper or imprinted on steel) so that it can’t be compromised.  Obtaining your seed phrase  Discover and Customer ServiceProton Wallet has a substantial “Discover” section in which you can learn more about everything from what Bitcoin is to Proton Wallet’s security model.  The ""Discover"" section  Proton also makes it relatively easy for you to get in touch with customer service staff, though, response times are currently unknown.  Contacting customer service  ConclusionProton Wallet is a good Bitcoin wallet for beginners, especially those looking to send bitcoin with relative ease, using nothing more than an email address.The pros of this non-custodial wallet are that it’s free to use, easy to set up and secure. It’s also bitcoin only and open-source.However, one notable con of the wallet is that it only allows you to transact on the bitcoin base chain, which means your transactions may incur high fees and take over an hour to fully process. For this reason, you wouldn’t want to use Proton Wallet if you're looking to make cheap, fast micropayments — the types of transactions you can make over Lightning.Another drawback of the wallet is that it doesn’t permit you to manage UTXOs. And it’s a software wallet, which means it’s less secure than a hardware wallet in certain regards.With that said, if you’re new to Bitcoin and already familiar with the interfaces for Proton products, then this wallet may be a good option for you."
Bitcoin Magazine,Jack Dorsey-Backed Nostr Emerges as Bitcoin's Social Layer at Riga Conference,"Thu, 29 Aug 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/jack-dorsey-backed-nostr-emerges-as-bitcoins-social-layer-at-riga-conference-,NostrWorld's Nostriga event highlighted strong synergies between Bitcoin and the nascent social protocol.,"The third edition of NostrWorld's unconference series took place last week in the picturesque city of Riga, Latvia, bringing together advocates and developers of the Nostr protocol. Spearheaded by Block CEO and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, NostrWorld's free gatherings are a platform for open-source enthusiasts to exchange ideas, foster collaboration, and ignite initiatives aimed at shaping a freer, more decentralized version of the internet.Bitcoin Magazine was on the ground in Riga to explore how the evolution of the Nostr protocol could influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. While Nostr’s budding community has famously attracted prominent Bitcoin advocates, Nostriga—as this third NostrWorld conference was dubbed—offered a fresh lens on the growing synergies between these two technologies. Conversations with attendees and observations throughout the two-day event revealed a clear trend: Bitcoin’s path appears increasingly likely to intertwine with Nostr’s promising social network technology.What’s Nostr?Nostr is an open-source protocol designed to create a decentralized, censorship-resistant social network. Unlike traditional platforms that rely on centralized servers, Nostr operates on a network of relays where users can publish and receive messages. Nostr is quickly gaining traction as a social layer for Bitcoin, enabling features like micropayments and digital identity management. Beyond social media, Nostr presents an opportunity to build a new internet architecture that frees users from reliance on centralized platforms. This approach empowers individuals by removing the need for intermediaries that typically own user data, monetize attention, and control or censor access.Micropayments Market FitA standout moment of the conference came when Strike CEO Jack Mallers shared a personal story about an acquaintance he had been trying to convince of Bitcoin’s potential for years. It wasn’t until she got onboarded onto Nostr and received Zaps to her account that the power of the technology finally clicked for her.Zaps are small Bitcoin payments, often sent as tips or rewards on Nostr, allowing users to support content creators directly through the Lightning Network. This micro-payment feature has become a popular way to demonstrate Bitcoin's utility and value in a social contextThe concept of micropayments predates even Bitcoin, but Nostr advocates believe Zaps represent the first successful large-scale implementation of the idea. On a panel alongside Primal CEO Miljan Braticevic, Jack Mallers emphasized the significance of this achievement:""I think that's very underappreciated. Something that has been desired on the web for many decades. From anonymous cypherpunks to the most powerful people in the world, all have desired this use case and we seem to have achieved that.”Micropayments through Nostr introduce a new bootstrapping mechanism that could reshape the traditional Bitcoin onboarding process. Individuals who might not be swayed by Bitcoin’s economic or political narrative might appreciate its unique value once exposed to casual internet tipping and microtransactions. This shift opens Bitcoin up to a broader audience by making it accessible in everyday social interactions already familiar to internet users.Setting the stage for the Ecash economyEcash, one of Bitcoin’s up-and-coming technologies was a recurring theme throughout the event. Cashu protocol developer CalleBTC made a passionate argument for the central role Nostr could play in an ecash-driven economy.Proposed as a system for private, scalable payments using blind signatures, ecash enables users to transact without revealing their identities, preserving financial privacy. However, this privacy comes with a tradeoff: ecash introduces trusted entities known as mints, which custody users' Bitcoin deposits in exchange for tokens, often referred to as notes. For ecash to function effectively, a robust market of mints is necessary to provide users with options for whom to trust. As the concept gains traction, this reliance on multiple mints introduces various coordination and discovery challenges—challenges developers believe are ideally suited to be addressed by Nostr’s social features.Examples of this are bitcoinmints.com and cashumints.space, two Nostr-based websites that offer a Yelp-like interfaces for users to discover new mint providers and for mints to advertise their services and build a reputation. Although the initial implementations are fairly basic, the potential integration of Nostr’s social graph could enable users to make informed decisions about which mints to trust. By leveraging connections within their network and trusted reviews from friends, users could more confidently choose mints based on the relationships and experiences shared by those they know. Eventually, the expectation is that similar Nostr-based services will be integrated directly into Bitcoin ecash wallets, offering users a seamless onboarding experience that avoids imposing trusted defaults. Similarly, Nostr’s infrastructure provides various methods to bolster the resilience of ecash mints, enabling future implementations to operate independently of the internet’s centralized DNS services. This would allow users to establish direct connections with mints, reducing their exposure to third-party interventions and enhancing the overall security and decentralization of the ecash system.Another fascinating concept emerging from the convergence of ecash and Nostr communities is the idea known as “nutsack.” Introduced by Nostr developer PabloF7z, Nutsack, or NIP-60, allows users to store ecash notes on Nostr relays, effectively distributing them across the network and tying them to the user’s identity. In effect, the scheme allows universal access to a user's ecash balance across any Nostr client that supports the feature. This means that, in the future, users could log into any website or online service and have their ecash balance seamlessly follow them, enabling effortless spending across multiple platforms.Communities and Web-Of-TrustOne of the biggest opportunities—and perhaps the most significant challenge—for Nostr is its ability to reach new internet communities beyond the Bitcoin-centric groups that currently dominate the platform. Announcements like developer Alex Gleason’s Ditto, made last week, have the potential to extend Nostr's reach into the broader landscape of existing internet communities, such as Mastodon, paving the way for wider adoption.“With Ditto people find websites they want to join because of a community and then they discover Nostr as a side effect, which gives them the opportunity to learn what it is and why it matters,” explained Gleason in his presentation. This amplification of Nostr’s network effect could have significant implications for Bitcoin adoption. With features like Zaps, Nostr offers a unique opportunity to introduce non-technical users to the power of an internet-native currency, making Bitcoin more accessible and relatable in everyday digital interactions.“Bitcoin is revolutionary and I believe it is key to Nostr’s success but social media needs communities.”Looking ahead, the formation of communities and the adoption of Nostr as an identity system could pave the way for digital economies rooted in the web-of-trust concept. By building social graphs based on cryptographically signed messages, users can carry their reputation across the internet, laying the groundwork for secure, decentralized commerce that operates independently of traditional laws, contracts, and enforcement mechanisms— with Bitcoin at the center of it all."
Bitcoin Magazine,The New Mission Critical Facilities: Bitcoin Mining Farms,"Thu, 29 Aug 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-new-mission-critical-facilities-bitcoin-mining-farms,A look at the operational dynamics and needs of data centers as it relates to Bitcoin mining.,"Life embodies evolution, change, adaptation, and the willingness to thrive. Throughout history, we have experienced numerous changes that have forced society to evolve, adapt, and grow. From the inception of trading to the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, we have witnessed events that have transformed the world. One of the most important and influential sectors in the world is finance. The world of finance has been shaped by pivotal events that have impacted economies, influenced policies, and altered the course of global markets. One of the most exceptional developments in the past 15 years is the invention of Bitcoin and the emergence of the crypto industry. The crypto industry, while not yet accessible to everyone, has witnessed remarkable growth and evolution since Bitcoin's launch in 2009. In the following years, the industry became a dynamic and influential force, drawing the attention of investors and enthusiasts worldwide. In this article, I will share my opinion on why crypto will become a very stable market, potentially replacing current financial or banking methods. This discussion will touch on key topics such as safety, circular economy, and sustainability, which combined with current high potential businesses like Data Centers, will shape the new future. Crypto Infrastructure and Energy Consumption The servers supporting the cryptocurrency infrastructure are primarily used for cryptocurrency mining, transaction verification, smart contract execution, and decentralized applications (DApps) hosting. These servers typically possess the following specifications: • High-performance CPUs and GPUs • Large memory and storage capacity • Advanced networking capabilities • Robust security features These characteristics translate into expensive, high-power consumption servers. Therefore, we need a robust and reliable space to store these servers and ensure they function as expected. Energy Consumption Data transmission currently consumes nearly 3% of the total electricity used worldwide. To ensure data is not only transmitted correctly but also stored and processed properly, we rely on physical spaces known as data centers. These data centers are considered mission-critical facilities. But why are data centers deemed mission-critical? Mission-critical facilities are broadly defined as operations that, if interrupted, would negatively impact business activities, ranging from revenue loss and legal non-compliance to, in extreme cases, loss of life. Data centers, hospitals, laboratories, and military installations are just a few examples of such facilities. Data center facilities are highly regulated by various organizations and standards for both physical and data infrastructure. This stringent regulation is crucial because data loss can result in massive consequences for millions of people, given the sensitivity of the stored information. Gradually, the blockchain industry along with emerging markets like AI (Artificial Intelligence) is playing an increasingly significant role in the modern world. The demand for distributed facilities to store nodes that validate crypto transactions and execute smart contracts is rising significantly. Are current Data Centers ready for Blockchain technology? Blockchain presents challenges not only for Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP) infrastructure but also for enterprise infrastructure. To accommodate the demanding workloads associated with blockchain technology, facilities will need to enhance both infrastructure security and MEP capabilities. Currently, the average power density in a data center is around 10 kW per rack. For context, according to several reports, the average power consumed by a home in the United States that uses electricity for heating and hot water is approximately 10,715 kWh per year. A single rack in a data center, by comparison, consumes nearly 9 times more power per year (8,760 kWh per year), with some facilities designed to provide peak power above 100 MW. Constructing these facilities requires significant investment, and sometimes the efficiency of the facility is not as desired, leading to higher costs for data management. One issue with current data centers is partial loads, meaning that if the facility consumes determined amount of Watts, the original design was for 1.5 times those Watts. This results in lower performance and efficiency. The closer the facility's consumption is to its designed energy consumption, the easier it is to improve and control overall efficiency. The key difference between blockchain and traditional data computation is decentralization. In a decentralized system, the failure of a single node does not impact the performance of the entire digital infrastructure, whereas in traditional systems, a node failure can cause significant and irreversible damage to many businesses. This necessity for high reliability and redundancy explains why data centers typically have high initial costs (CAPEX), with multiple layers of security to ensure continued operation even in the event of equipment failure. However, the decentralization inherent in blockchain technology offers a distinct advantage: it reduces the need for expensive and redundant facilities to accommodate all crypto servers, as the failure of some nodes does not disrupt the entire system. This raises an important question: what is the solution to integrating traditional data transmission methods with new blockchain technology? Combining current needs with new Crypto needs In the data center industry, the terminology of ""Tiers"" as defined by the Uptime Institute is widely used and accepted globally. This classification system is similar to the levels of redundancy specified by TIA or BICSI standards. While those familiar with the data center market are well-versed in these Tiers, here is an explanation for crypto users who may be new to this terminology: There are four Tiers, each representing a different level of redundancy in a facility: 1. Tier I: No redundancy. 2. Tier II: Redundancy. 3. Tier III: Concurrently maintainable. 4. Tier IV: Fault-tolerant. These Tiers also correlate with the initial investment required to create the facility. Moving from one Tier to the next typically involves doubling the capital expenditure (CAPEX). Most data centers are ranked as Tier III, indicating they are designed to be concurrently maintainable. This ensures the facility can be kept in optimal condition to prevent failures at any time. It is crucial to note that some IT equipment hosted in a data center is essential for the daily operations of our lives; even traffic lights rely on these services. For blockchain infrastructure, there is no need to significantly increase CAPEX to ensure the proper operation of the equipment. It is essential to accommodate the servers in an environment where they function correctly with minimal downtime. Since the loss of individual servers does not affect the functionality of the entire blockchain, these operations do not require high availability. Although downtime can affect users earning revenue from transaction validation, it is crucial to evaluate whether the cost of reducing downtime justifies the increased CAPEX.Therefore, the Tier level of these facilities can be reduced. In some areas of the data center that are not critical to powering the crypto nodes, the Tier can be lowered to Tier II or even Tier I. This approach optimizes resources without compromising the overall blockchain infrastructure. Crypto Mining as a Single Business? To support our previous discussions and to foster new ones, consider the following data: Following the Bitcoin halving on April 20, 2024, the return on investment (ROI) per miner has decreased by 50%, irrespective of variations in total hashrate or Bitcoin price. This reduction tightens the overall financial outlook. For instance, a miner costing $2,000, producing 120 TH/s, and requiring no additional capital expenditures (CAPEX) beyond the miner itself, now faces this ROI decrease. For an installation comprising 100 miners, the total CAPEX investment for the entire facility (including land for one container, MEP infrastructure, and miners) is estimated at around $503,000. The following analysis illustrates the approximate ROI over the next four years (until the next halving) for a facility operating 100 miners, each consuming 3.3 kW and with a price per kilowatt hour equal to 0.08$. To try to make it more accurate, this analysis assumes the hashrate increases by 50% annually, and uses traditional air cooling solutions. The projected future Bitcoin price used in this analysis is $250,000, based on various studies and speculations.    The projected ROI over the next four years, considering a future Bitcoin price of $300,000, shows that crypto mining alone might not be a highly profitable business. This raises the question of why companies continue to invest in crypto mining. The answer is speculation. In bullish times, crypto facilities were highly profitable, but now these facilities need additional revenue streams.Heat Reuse: A Disruptive Side Hustle One innovative side hustle is converting these facilities into heating power facilities. Most power consumed by miners/servers is converted into heat. What if we could capture that heat and sell it as energy? For example, selling this energy to a nearby farm for greenhouses at $0.03/kWh makes the business model more viable. Considering a supposed extra investment of $750,000 (please bear in mind that the extra investment has to be calculated according to facility limitations and in this case a ball park number was taken into account for the exercise).    Upon initial analysis, the business model appears to be viable. The integration of a heat reuse side business has effectively doubled the return on investment (ROI). It is important to note that the ROI calculation is based on a four-year period, coinciding with the next Bitcoin halving event. While the facilities may no longer be optimal for the same cryptocurrency operations post-halving, the infrastructure will remain valuable for selling the generated heat.Moreover, if we consider combining this model with the data center market, the ROI extends beyond the next four years. This represents a long-term investment where the efficient use of electricity could become increasingly significant. Conclusion The crypto industry is gaining more importance in our lives. Several companies are adding stablecoins to their portfolios as financial assets, and new technologies are emerging on the blockchain that will require specialized facilities like current data centers (like BlockDAG architecture, Ordinals/NFTs, BRC20 and, most importantly, Runes). We are at the beginning of a market that will stay and change the current scenario. Combining legacy data centers with crypto-specific areas to facilitate additional businesses like heat reuse is likely just a matter of time, a run to become sustainable. Those who lead this transformation will be the ones to benefit the most.This is a guest post by Jose Farrona.

In very few words they can announce a half-truth; and in order to demonstrate that it is incomplete, we are obliged to have recourse to long and dry dissertations.” — Frédéric Bastiat, Economic Sophisms, First Series (1845)“The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it.” — Williamson (2016) on Brandolini’s LawFor too long, the world has had to endure the fallout of subpar academic research on bitcoin mining’s energy use and environmental impact. The outcome of this bullshit research has been shocking news headlines that have turned some well-meaning people into angry politicians and deranged activists. So that you never have to endure the brutality of one of these sloppy papers, I’ve sacrificed my soul to the bitcoin mining gods and performed a full-scale analysis of a study from the United Nations University, published recently in the American Geophysical Union’s Earth’s Future. Only the bravest and hardest of all bitcoin autists may proceed to the following paragraphs, the rest of you can go back to watching the price chart.Your soft baby ears might have screamed with shock at the strong proclamation in my lede that the biggest and squeakiest research on bitcoin mining is bullshit. If you’ve ever read Jonathan Koomey’s 2018 blog post on the Digiconomist–also known as Alex deVries, or his 2019 Coincenter report, or Lei et al. 2021, or Sai and Vranken 2023, or Masanet et al. 2021, or… Well, the point is that there’s thousands of words already written that have shown that bitcoin mining energy modeling is in a state of crisis and that this is not isolated to bitcoin! It’s a struggle that data center energy studies have faced for decades. People like Jonathan Koomey, Eric Masanet, Arman Shehabi, and those nice guys Sai and Vranken (sorry, we’re not yet on a first-name basis) have written enough pages that could probably cover the walls of at least one men’s bathroom at every bitcoin conference that’s happened last year, that show this to be true.My holy altar, which I keep in my bedroom closet, is a hand-carved, elegant yet ascetic shrine to Koomey, Masanet, and Shehabi for the decades of work they’ve done to improve data center energy modeling. These sifus of computing have made it all very clear to me: if you don’t have bottom-up data and you rely on historical trends while ignoring IT device energy efficiency trends and what drives demand, then your research is bullshit. And so, with one broad yet very surgical stroke, I swipe left on Mora et al. (2018), deVries (2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023), Stoll et al. (2019), Gallersdorfer et al. (2020), Chamanara et al. (2023), and all the others that are mentioned in Sai and Vranken’s comprehensive review of the literature. World, let these burn in one violent yet metaphorically majestic mega-fire somewhere off the coast of the Pacific Northwest. Reporters, and policymakers, please, I implore you to stop listening to Earthjustice, Sierra Club, and Greenpeace for they know not what they do. Absolve them of their sins, for they are but sheep. Amen.Now that I’ve set the mood for you, my pious reader, I will now tell you a story about a recent bitcoin energy study. I pray to the bitcoin gods that this will be the last one I ever write, and the last one you’ll ever need to read, but my feeling is that the gods are punishing gods and will not have mercy on my soul–even in a bull market. One deep breath (cue Heath Ledger’s Joker) and Here… We… Go.On a somewhat bearish October afternoon, I got tagged on Twitter/X on a post about a new bitcoin energy use study from some authors affiliated with the United Nations University (Chamanara et al., 2023). Little did I know that this study would trigger my autism so hard that I would descend into my own kind of drug-induced-gonzo-fear-and-loathing-in-vegas state, and hyper-focus on this study for the next four weeks. While I am probably exaggerating about the heavy drug use, my recollection of this time is very much a techno-colored, toxic relationship-level fever dream. Do you remember Frank from the critically acclaimed 2001 film, Donnie Darko? Yeah, he was there, too.As I started taking notes on the paper, I realized that Chamanara et al.’s study was really confusing. The paper was perplexing because it's a poorly designed study that bases its raison d’etre entirely on de Vries and Mora et al. It uses the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance (CCAF) Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index (CBECI) data without acknowledging the limitations of the model (see Lei et al. 2021 and Sai and Vranken 2023 for an in-depth analysis of the issues with CBECI’s modeling). It conflates its results from the 2020-2021 period with the state of bitcoin mining in 2022 and 2023. The authors also relied on some environmental footprint methodology that would make you think it was actually possible for you to shrink or grow a reservoir depending on how hard you Netflix and chill. Really, this is what Obringer et al. (2020) inferentially conclude is possible and the UN study cites Obringer as one of its methodological foundations. By the way, Koomey and Masanet did not like Obringer et al.’s methodology, either. I’ll light another soy-based candle at the altar in their honor.Here’s a more clearly stated enumeration of the crux of the problem with Chamanara et al. (and by the way, their corresponding author never responded to my email asking for their data so I could, you know, verify, not trust. 🥴):The authors conflated electricity use across multiple years, overreaching on what the results could reveal based on their methods.The authors used historical trends to make present and future recommendations despite extensive peer-reviewed literature clearly showing that this leads to overestimates and exaggerated claims.The paper promises an energy calculation that will reveal bitcoin’s true energy use and environmental impact. They use two sets of data from CBECI: i) total monthly energy consumption and ii) average hashrate share for the top ten countries where bitcoin mining is operated. Keep in mind that CBECI relies on IP addresses that are tracked at several mining pools. CBECI-affiliated mining pools represent an average of 34.8% of the total network hashrate. So, the data used likely have fairly wide uncertainty bars.After about an hour or so of Troy Cross talking me off a rather impressive, art deco and weather-worn ledge that’s probably seen a few Great Gatsby flappers jump–a result of feeling an overwhelming sense of terror after my exasperated self realized that no amount of cognitive behavioral therapy would get me through this study–I determined the equation that the authors used to calculate the energy use shares for each of the top ten countries with the most share of hashrate (based on the IP address estimates) had to be the following:   Don’t let the math scare you. Here’s an example of how this equation works. Let’s say China has a shared share for January 2020 of 75%. Then, let’s also say that the total energy consumption for January 2020 was 10 TWh (these are made-up numbers for simplicity’s sake). Then, for one month, we’d find that China used 7.5 TWh of energy. Now, save that number in your memory palace and do the same operation for February 2020. Next, add the energy use for January to the energy use found for February. Do this for each subsequent month until you’ve added up all 12 months. You now have CBECI’s China’s annual energy consumption for 2020.Before I show the table with my results, let me explain another caveat to the UN study. This study uses an older version of CBECI data. To be fair to the authors, they submitted their paper for review before CBECI updated their machine efficiency calculations. However, this means that Chamanara et al.’s results are not even close to realistic because we now believe that CBECI’s older model was overestimating energy use. Moreover, to do this comparison, I was limited to data through August 31, 2023, because CBECI switched to the new model for the rest of 2023. To get this older data, CCAF was generous and shared it with me upon request.Country2020 Energy Consumption (TWh)2021 Energy Consumption (TWh)2020 + 2021 Energy Consumption (TWh)Chamanara et al.'s 2020 + 2021 Energy Consumption (TWh)Percent Change Between 2020 + 2021 Calculations (%)Mainland China44.4532.8977.3473.485.25United States4.6525.2029.8532.89-9.24Kazakhstan3.1812.0615.2415.94-4.39Russia4.717.5912.2912.280.081Malaysia3.314.137.447.292.06Canada0.805.256.056.62-8.61Iran2.333.065.395.134.82Germany0.673.313.984.18-4.78Ireland0.622.693.313.43-3.50Singapore0.311.131.431.56-0.083Other (Excluding Singapore)3.696.7310.4210.63-1.98Total68.72104.04172.76173.42-0.38Another tricky thing about this study is that they combined the energy use for both 2020 and 2021 into one number. This was really tricky because if you look at their figures, you’ll notice that the biggest text states, “Total: 173.42 TWh”. It’s also slightly confusing because the figure caption states, “2020-2021”, which for many people would be interpreted as a period of 12 months, not 24 months. Well, whatever. I broke them up into their individual years so everyone could see the steps that were taken to get to these numbers.Look at the far right column with the header, “Percent Change Between 2020 + 2021 Calculations (%)”. I calculated the percent change between my calculations and Chamanara et al.’s. This is rather curious, isn’t it? Based on my conversations with the researchers at CCAF, the numbers should be identical. Maybe the changelog doesn’t reflect a smaller change somewhere, but our numbers are slightly different nonetheless. China has a greater share and the United States has a smaller share in the data that CCAF shared with me compared to the UN study. Despite this, the totals are fairly close. So, let’s give the authors the benefit of the doubt and say that they did a reasonable job calculating the energy share, given the limitations of the CBECI model. Please bear in mind that noting that their calculation was reasonable doesn’t mean that it’s reasonable to use these historical estimates to make claims about the present and future and direct policy. It isn’t.One evening while working by candlelight, I glanced to my left and saw Frank’s stabbing, black pupils (the Donnie Darko character I mentioned earlier) staring at me like two pieces of Stronghold waste coal, fixed in a quiet bed of pearly sand. He was reminding me that this report was still not finished and something about time travel. I grabbed my extra-soft curls (I switched to bar shampoo, it’s a godsend for frizz) and yanked as hard as I could. Willie Nelson’s 1974 Austin City Limits pilot episode blasting on my cheap-ass Chinese knock-off monitor’s mono speakers was moving through my ears like heroin through Lou Reed’s 4-lanes wide network of veins. Begrudgingly, I accepted my fate. I needed to go deeper down this rabbit hole. I needed to do a deeper analysis of the 2020 and 2021 CBECI data to show how important it is to do an annual analysis and not blur the years into one calculation. Realizing I was out of my hard liquor of choice, a splash of sherry in a Shirley Temple (shaken, not stirred), I grabbed a bottle of bootleg antiseptic that I got during the pandemic lockdown and chugged.I flipped through my notes. I have lots of notes because I’m a serious person. What about the mining map issues? Can we do this through an analysis of the two separate years? What was happening for each of the ten countries? Does that tell us anything about where hashrate went after the China ban? What about the Kazakhstan crackdown? That’s post-2021, but the UN study acts like it never happened when they’re talking about the current mining distribution…Not to the authors’ credit, they failed to mention to the peer-reviewers and to their readers that the mining map data only goes through January 2022. So, even though they talk about bitcoin mining’s energy mix as if it represents the present, they are completely wrong. Their analysis only captures historical trends, not the present and definitely not the future.   See this multi-colored plot of CBECI's estimated daily energy use (TWh) from January 2020 through August 31, 2023? At this macro scale, we see plenty of variability. But also it’s apparent just from inspection that each year is different from the next in terms of variability and energy use. There are a number of possible reasons for the cause of variability at this scale. Some possible influences on energy use could be bitcoin price, difficulty adjustment, and machine efficiency. More macroscale influences could be as a result of regulation, such as the Chinese bitcoin mining ban that occurred in 2021. Many of the Chinese miners fled the country for other parts of the world, Kazakhstan and the United States are two countries where hashrate found refuge. In fact, the power of the Texas mining scene really came to be at this unprecedented moment in hashrate history.            Look at the histograms for 2020 (top left), 2021 (top right), 2022 (bottom left), and 2023 (bottom right). It’s obvious that for each year, the estimated annualized energy consumption data shows different distributions. Even though we do see some possible distribution patterns, we have to be careful not to take this as a pattern that happens every four-year cycle. We need more data to be sure. For now, what we can say is that some years in our analysis show a bimodal distribution while other years show a kind of skewed distribution. The main point here is to show that the statistics for energy use for each of these four years are different, and distinctly so for the two years that were used in Chamanara et al.’s analysis.In the UN study, the authors wrote that bitcoin mining exceeded 100 TWh per year in 2021 and 2022. However, if we look at the histograms of the daily estimated annualized energy consumption, we can see that daily estimates vary quite a bit, and even in 2022 there were many days where the estimated energy consumption was below 100 TWh. We’re not denying that the final estimates were over 100 TWh in the older estimated data for these years. Instead, we’re showing that because bitcoin mining’s energy use is not constant from day to day or even minute-to-minute, it’s worth doing a deeper analysis to understand the origin of this variability and how it might affect energy use over time. Lastly, it’s worth noting that the updated data now estimates the annual energy use to be 89 TWh for 2021 and 95.53 TWh for 2022.One last comment, Miller et al. 2022 showed that operations (specifically buildings) with high variability in energy use over time are generally not suitable for emission studies that use averaged annual emission factors. Yet, that’s what Chamanara et al. chose to do, and what so many of these bullshit models tend to do. A good portion of bitcoin mining doesn’t operate like a constant load, Bitcoin mining can be highly flexible in response to many factors from grid stability to price to regulation. It’s about time that researchers started thinking about bitcoin mining from this understanding. Had the authors spent even a modest amount of time reading previously published literature, rather than operating in a silo like Sai and Vranken noted in their review paper, they might have at least addressed this limitation in their study.—So, I’ve never been to a honky tonk joint before. At least not until I found myself in a taxi cab with several other conferencegoers at the North American Blockchain Summit. Fort Worth, Texas, is exactly what you’d imagine. Cowboy boots, gallon-sized cowboy hats, Wrangler blue jeans, and cowboys, cowboys, cowboys everywhere you looked through the main drag. On a brisk Friday night, Fort Worth seemed frozen in time, people actually walked around at night. The stores looked like the kind of mom-and-pop shops you’d see on an episode of The Twilight Zone. I felt completely disoriented.My companions convinced me that I should learn how to two-step. Me, your standard California girl, whose physics advisor once told her that while you can take the girl out of California, you can’t take California out of the girl, should two-step?! I didn’t know a two-step from an electric slide and the only country I remember experiencing was a Garth Brooks commercial I saw once on television when I was a child. He was really popular in the nineties. That’s about as much country as this bitcoin mining researcher gets. The place was filled with kitschy gift shops and bright lights everywhere radiating from neon signs. At the center of the main room, a bartender wearing a black diamond studded belt with a white leather gun holster and lined with evenly spaced silver bullets. Who the hell knows what kind of gun he was packing, but it did remind me of the guns in the 1986 film, Three Amigos.It was here, against the backdrop of what sounded like a country band that wasn’t entirely sure that it was country, that I watched the Texas Blockchain Council’s Lee Bratcher address a ball with the kind of trigonometric grace that you could only find at the end of a cue and land that billiard in a tattered, leather pocket for what seemed like the hundredth time that night. The smooth clank of billiard against billiard awoke something inside me. I realized that I was not yet out of the rabbit hole that Frank sent me down. I remembered somewhere scribbled in my notes that I had not plotted the hashrate share over time for the countries mentioned in the UN study. So, at half past three in the morning, I threw my head back to take a swig of some club soda and bumped it against the wall of the photo booth where nuclear families could pose with a mechanical bull, and fell unconscious.Three hours later, I was back in my hotel room. Thankfully, someone placed some worthless fiat in my hand, loaded me into a cab, and had the driver take me back to the non-smoking room I checked into at the very center of the decay of twenty-first-century business travel, the Marriott Hotel. Fuzzy-brained and bleary-eyed, I let the blinding, dangerously blue light from my computer screen wash over my tired face and increase my chances of developing macular degeneration. I continued my analysis.   What follows are a series of plots of CBECI mining map data from January 2020 through January 2022. Unsurprisingly, Chamanara et al. focus attention on China’s contribution to energy use, and subsequently to its associated environmental footprint. China’s monthly hashrate peaked at over 70 percent of the network’s total hashrate in 2020. In July 2021, that hashrate share crashed to zero until it recovered to about 20 percent of the share at the end of 2021. We don’t know where it stands today, but industry insiders tell me it’s likely still hovering around this number, which means that in absolute terms, the hashrate is still growing there despite the ban.   Russia, also unsurprisingly, gets discussed as well. Yet, based on the CBECI mining map data from January 2020 through January 2022, it’s hard to argue that Russia was an immediate off-taker of exiled hashrate. There’s certainly an immediate spike, but is this real or just miners using VPN to hide their mining operation? By the end of 2021, the Russian hashrate declined to below 5 percent of the hashrate and in absolute terms, declined from a brief peak of over 13 EH/s to a bit over 8 EH/s. When looking at the total year’s worth of CBECI estimated energy use for Russia, we do see that Russia did hold a significant portion of hashrate, it’s just not clear that when working with such a limited set of data, we can make any reasonable claims about the present contribution to hashrate and environment footprint for the network.   The most controversial discussion in Chamanara et al. deals with Kazakhstan’s share of energy use and environmental footprint. Obviously, the CBECI mining map data shows that there was a significant increase in hashrate share both in relative and absolute terms. It also appears that this trend started before the China ban was implemented, but certainly appears to rapidly increase just before and after the ban was implemented. However, we do see a sharp decline from December 2021 to January 2022. Was this an early signal that the government crackdown was coming in Kazakhstan?In their analysis, Chamanara et al. ignored the recent Kazakhstan crackdown, where the government imposed an energy tax and mining licenses on the industry, effectively pushing hashrate out of the country. The authors overemphasized Kazakhstan as a current major contributor to bitcoin’s energy use and thus environmental footprint. If the authors had stayed within the limits of their methods and results, then noting the contribution of Kazakhstan’s hashrate share to the environmental footprint for the combined years of 2020 and 2021 would have been reasonable. Instead, not only do they ignore the government crackdown in 2022, but they also claim that Kazakhstan's hashrate share increased by 34% based on 2023 CBECI numbers. CBECI’s data has not been updated since January 2022 and CCAF researchers are currently waiting for data from the mining pools that will allow them to update the mining map.   I know I’ve shown you, my faithful reader, a lot of data, but go ahead and have another shot of the hardest liquor you have in your cabinet, and let’s take a look at one more figure. This one represents the United States hashrate share in the older CBECI mining map data. The trend we see for the United States is also similar for Canada, Singapore, and what CBECI Calls “Other countries”, which represent the countries that did not make the top ten list for hashrate share. There’s a clear signal that reflects what we know to be true. The United States took a significant portion of Chinese hashrate and this hashrate share grew rapidly in 2021. While we know that the CBECI mining map data is limited to less than a majority of the network hashrate, I do think that their share is at least somewhat representative of the network’s geographic distribution. Hashrate geographic distribution seems to be heavily shaped by macro trends. While electricity prices matter, government stability and friendly laws play an important role. Chamanara et al. should have done this kind of analysis to help inform their discussion. If they had, they might have realized that the network is responding to external pressures at varying times and geographic scales. We need more data before we can make strong policy recommendations when it comes to the effects of bitcoin’s energy use.—At this point, I was no longer sure if I was a bitcoin researcher or an NPC, lost in a game where the only points tallied were for the intensity of self-loathing I was feeling for agreeing to this undertaking. At the same time, I could smell the end of this analysis was near and that, with enough somatic therapy and EMDR, I might actually remember who I used to be before I got dragged into this mess. Just two days prior, Frank and I had a falling out over whether Courier New was still the best font for displaying mathematical equations. I was alone in this rabbit hole now. I dug my fingers into the dirt walls surrounding me and slowly clawed my way back to sanity.Upon exiting the hole, I grabbed my laptop and decided it was time to address the study’s environmental footprint methodology, wrap up this puppy, and put a bow on it. Chamanara et al. claimed that they followed the methods used by Ristic et al. (2019) and Obringer et al. (2020). There are a few reasons why their environmental footprint approach is flawed. First, the footprint factors are typically used for assessing the environmental footprint of energy generation. In Ristic et al., the authors developed a metric called the Relative Aggregated Factor that incorporated these factors. This metric allowed them to evaluate the placement of new electricity generators like nuclear or offshore wind. The idea behind this approach was to be mindful that while carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels were the main driver for developing energy transition goals, we should also avoid replacing fossil fuel generation with generation that could create environmental problems in different ways.Second, Obringer et al. used many of the factors listed in Ristic et al. and combined them with network transmission factors from Aslan et al. (2018). This was a bad move because Koomey is a co-author on this paper, so it shouldn’t be surprising that in 2021, Koomey co-authored a commentary alongside Masanet where they called out Obringer et al. In Koomey and Masanet, 2021, the authors chided the assumption that short-term changes in demand would lead to immediate and proportional changes in electricity use. This critique could also be applied to Chamanara et al., which looked at a period when bitcoin was experiencing a run-up to an all-time high in price during a unique economic environment (low interest rates, COVID stimulus checks, and lockdowns). Koomey and Masanet made it clear in their commentary that ignoring the non-proportionality between energy and data flows in network equipment can yield inflated environmental-impact results.More importantly, we have yet to characterize what this relationship looks like for bitcoin mining. Demand for traditional data centers is defined by the number of compute instances needed. What is the equivalent for bitcoin mining when we know that the block size is unchanging and the block pace is adjusted every two weeks to keep an average 10-minute spacing between each block? This deserves more attention.Either way, Chamanara et al. did not seem to be aware of the criticisms of Obringer et al.’s approach. This is really problematic because as mentioned at the start of this screed, Koomey and Masanet laid the groundwork for data center energy research. They should have known not to apply these methods to bitcoin mining because while the industry has differences from a traditional data center, it’s still a type of data center. There’s a lot that bitcoin mining researchers can take from the torrent of data center literature. It’s disappointing and exhausting to see papers published that ignore this reality.What more can I say other than this shit has to stop. Brandolini’s Law is real. The bullshit asymmetry is real. I really want this new halving cycle to be the one where I no longer have to address bad research. While I was writing this report, Alex de Vries published a new bullshit paper on bitcoin mining’s “water footprint”. I haven’t read it yet. I’m not sure that I will. But if I do, I promise that I will not write over 10,000 words on it. I’ve stated my case and made my peace with this genre of academic publishing. It was a fun ride, but I think it’s time to practice some self-care, treat myself to several evenings of healthy binge-watching, and dream of the ineffable.—If you enjoyed this article, please visit btcpolicy.org where you can read the full 10,000-word technical analysis of the Chamanara et al.

Bitcoin Magazine,The Other Satoshis: Bitcoin's Most Important Early Contributors,"Wed, 28 Aug 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/the-other-satoshis-bitcoins-most-important-early-contributors,"Early in Bitcoin’s history, many contributors helped the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto shape the technology we all know today. A review of their legacies, from ""The Halving Issue"".","This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine’s “The Halving Issue”. Click here to get your copy.If, in 2021, the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains a mystery, so too does the two-year period from 2008 to 2010 when Bitcoin’s creator served as the project’s principal developer and leader. Yet, far from a lifeless period of project development, during those years Nakamoto worked with dozens if not hundreds of Bitcoin users, all of whom contributed to the effort in different ways, establishing websites, engaging in commerce and evangelizing for his invention. Still, some users naturally emerged as more distinguished contributors. Whether it was by helping establish core elements of the Bitcoin philosophy or articulating its value propositions in new and novel ways, a meritocracy developed as quickly as the market, with some contributors earning outsized accolades from their peers.With that in mind, this list aims to identify the contributors who most helped to define and shape Bitcoin and its early years, identifying their specific efforts and spotlighting their relevant work.Martti Malmi (@Sirius)   Satoshi’s initial assistant, Martti Malmi, demonstrated a commitment to Bitcoin at a time when few were willing to see value in an internet currency that lacked even an exchange rate.A university student in May 2009, Malmi contributed most directly to Bitcoin.org and the Bitcoin Wiki, where he helped make the websites look more comprehensive and professional. (He was less kind to euros he used at the time, writing “Bitcoin.org” on any bills he encountered.) Malmi also added an early Austrian perspective to conversations around Bitcoin, dismissing complaints about gold as “old Keynesian arguments” and noting that the precious metal was “unmatched” by any paper money in the stability it offered over time.In his entrepreneurial efforts, Malmi was less successful, his early bitcoin exchange service, BitcoinExchange.com, struggling to get off the ground in 2010. Yet, he’d arguably make his biggest mark evangelizing for Bitcoin, creating a Facebook page (“Say no to central banking — use Bitcoin, the revolutionary P2P currency!” it read) and leading the first major effort to get Bitcoin publicity. Theymos    One of Bitcoin’s most influential thinkers, Theymos never contributed code to the Bitcoin project directly but worked for years as a central moderator for its major forums.A keen student of the codebase, his influence was apparent from the project’s earliest days when on the Bitcoin.org forums or IRC Theymos could be counted on to define how the protocol worked, his understanding sometimes even surpassing that of other avid coders. What’s clear is that, after discovering Bitcoin in February 2010, Theymos went to work auditing the code, as his posts show an intricate understanding of not just the basic concepts, but even the more obscure commands Satoshi added to the codebase at launch.However, it’s Theymos’ contributions to project philosophy that perhaps stand out the most. The first to point out directly that changes to the code could result in issues impacting the rights of users, it’s clear Theymos thought deeply about the implications of Bitcoin’s design. For instance, he was at the forefront of arguing users could leverage their ability to fork the code if they ever disagreed with project leadership, an argument he’d push to its limits when he’d attempt to overturn a code change enacted by Satoshi.The fact that, when looking back at this disagreement, many would side with Theymos’ view on the matter is all the more evidence that his early thinking has endured.Hal Finney (@Hal)   A storied cypherpunk, Hal Finney tragically only contributed code briefly at the earliest days of Bitcoin and was absent for much of 2009 and 2010 as he struggled to regain his health. Still, Finney’s influence today rings far and wide, most notably for the enduring optimism with which he approached the project. Among his sparse blog posts are some of the most widely quoted moments from the project’s history, including his initial calculations on how, if successful, bitcoin could someday be worth millions should it grow to denominate global economic exchange.Elsewhere, Finney has even been credited with his own branch of philosophy on how Bitcoin might scale, the term “Finnian view” coming to denote his belief that second-layer networks, as well as bitcoin banks, would help solve the technology’s struggles to accommodate demand. Finney, who passed away in 2014 at 58, was also the recipient of the first-ever bitcoin transaction, and the only person known to have transacted directly with Satoshi Nakamoto. NewLibertyStandard   What is bitcoin worth? If it’s a question many have asked, NewLibertyStandard was the first to provide a response. Indeed, the first-ever quoted price for bitcoin was given by NewLibertyStandard on October 5, 2009, when they posted a daily exchange rate of 1,303 BTC per U.S. dollar. The calculation was made by factoring the cost of the electricity used to mine newly minted bitcoin and lauded by Satoshi as a helpful step in pricing the cryptocurrency.Not just the creator of the earliest bitcoin exchange, NewLibertyStandard proposed using the Thai baht symbol to represent Bitcoin and suggested “BTC” as its three-letter currency code.Despite his outsized contributions to the bitcoin economy, however, NewLibertyStandard could also wax philosophical. As an example, they were an early advocate for the idea that Bitcoin might enable individuals to peacefully exit their government currencies.Gavin Andresen   Andresen may not have been the father of Bitcoin, but in many ways, he raised the kid. An Australian-born Silicon Valley expat best known for creating a standard for 3D graphics in his younger days (VRML), Andresen had an established career in software prior to coding on Bitcoin, which included time spent at computer manufacturer Silicon Graphics. His rise up the ranks of the Bitcoin meritocracy would be swift. Not only did he give away over 1,000 bitcoin free of charge to new users, but he quickly became Satoshi’s most active contributor, gaining access to update the code directly by late 2010. Indeed, it would be Andresen who would “step up” in Satoshi’s absence, leading a charge to push new developers to get involved in the project and shouldering the weight of the press and media that descended during Bitcoin’s first rise to the fringes of the tech mainstream in 2011. Often now critiqued for his role in stoking later frictions in the project, it’s easy to overlook the fact that Andresen was also one of Bitcoin’s most eloquent early spokespeople, his arguments for it as a “just plain better money” finding ears when bitcoin was a “drug currency” to most.Laszlo Hanyecz (laszlo)   Best known as the man who spent thousands of bitcoin on pizza, Laszlo Hanyecz was a Florida-based coder who first translated Bitcoin (then available only for Windows) into MacOS. Joining the project in April 2010, Hanyecz quickly announced an interest in running Bitcoin on his iPhone, but it would be his May 2010 decision to pay 10,000 BTC to anyone who would buy him pizza that would mark his most significant contribution. At the time, Bitcoin had an established price (less than a penny), and bitcoin had been bought and sold, but no real-world product had ever been purchased with the fledgling currency. Hanyecz’s time with the project would be brief, however. He stopped contributing in August 2010 but has resurfaced from time to time for interviews, most recently in 2009 for the news show “60 Minutes” where he discussed his bitcoin pizza purchase.Artforz   A largely unknown figure, Artforz is nonetheless credited with notable engineering contributions, as they are thought to be the first Bitcoin user to mine with more powerful GPUs (in the process starting the global mining arms race that continues to this day).Though Artforz denied making up 25% of the early network’s hash rate as accused, it was a rumor during his day, one they eventually had to address directly on the forums.Still, if Artforz did mine an outsized number of early blocks, he showed himself to be an altruistic steward of the network, identifying a bug in one case that, if exploited, would have allowed him to spend bitcoin from other wallets he didn’t own, reporting it directly to Satoshi.Artforz could also explain and defend Bitcoin with the best of them. When presented with the idea users might never know the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, Artforz settled the conversation succinctly, stating simply: “Let the idea speak for itself.”Jeff Garzik (jgarzik)   A seasoned Linux open-source contributor by the time he found Bitcoin in 2010, Garzik is known for helping shape project strategy under Andresen, the developer he mentored and encouraged to step up in the wake of Satoshi’s absence.Yet, Garzik was an active contributor in the days of Satoshi as well, and he remains the author of some of the era’s more often-cited Bitcoin forum posts. Controversially, this includes the first proposal to raise the “block size limit,” first added by Nakamoto, as well as another, more influential proposal to remove subsidies for free transactions. Later conflicts aside, a review of Garzik’s posts shows what made him such a strong advocate for Bitcoin, one who was revered for thoughtful articulations on how the early network worked. In one memorable line, Garzik said: “The effort to raise the transaction rate limit is the same as the effort to change the fundamental nature of bitcoins: convince the vast majority to upgrade.”Ironically, it would be his efforts to lead such a charge that would mark the end of his time with the Bitcoin project nearly a decade later. Amir Taaki (genjix)   A former poker professional and open-source video game designer, Amir Taaki was little more than 20 years old when he stumbled on Bitcoin in late 2010. Though it wouldn’t be until 2014 that he graced the pages of Forbes and Wired on the strength of his preference for Bitcoin as a way to fight the establishment, Taaki showed the flashes of what would make him such a polarizing (and popular) figure even in the days of Satoshi. First and foremost, he’d attempt to get the organizations he most admired into Bitcoin — organizations like Anonymous and WikiLeaks. As he went about coding what would be the first-ever alternative implementation (libbitcoin), Taaki would find time to build a coalition to convince WikiLeaks to accept bitcoin, a decision that would eventually put him at odds with Satoshi who protested the move. “Sorry for trying to do something,” he would state in response to later criticism. His early forum posts showcase how and why Taaki would emerge as such a lightning rod, his responses equal parts combative, illuminating and pulsing with intensity. Kiba   Likely the least well-known name on this list, Kiba isn’t exactly an industry name.That said, they are responsible for helping shape something that continues to this day, the legacy of Satoshi Nakamoto. As a string of Twitter, IRC and BitcoinTalk posts from 2010 to 2011 show, Kiba was the first to play around with the idea of Satoshi’s identity, or in his own words, to try “damn hard to make the mystery of Satoshi a meme.” These efforts mostly took the form of sketches of Bitcoin’s creator, in which Kiba depicted him as everything from a Japanese warrior to a woman in a series he called “The Mysteries of Satoshi Nakamoto.” (His Bitcoin art, sadly, is lost to link rot.)But while he could be playful, it’s clear Kiba knew Bitcoin users were in charge, dropping early quotes that would be sure to kill on Twitter even today. “Satoshi’s invention is useless without us using it,” he wrote in October 2010. When Satoshi finally left the project, it was Kiba who declared what appears to be the first Bitcoin holiday, canonizing April 28, 2011, as “Satoshi Disappear Day,” writing: “I propose we make a Bitcoin holiday in honor of our legendary anonymous founder and to observe the fact that the bitcoin community will be just fine after the inventor of bitcoin left.”Today, Bitcoin Magazine carries on that tradition. "
Bitcoin Magazine,The Security Hustle: Protecting My Bitcoin From Hackers,"Wed, 28 Aug 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-security-hustle-protecting-my-bitcoin-from-hackers,Bitcoin is a highly desirable asset to hackers. This extensive guide will help you protect your funds as a Bitcoin investor.,"Bitcoin, the world’s first and leading cryptocurrency, has proven its mettle in its roughly fifteen years of existence. From 2011 to 2021, it was the world's best-performing asset class in eight of the last eleven years. At the end of 2023, it reemerged as the world's top-performing asset class.It is also a trillion-dollar asset. BTC's market capitalization is at $1.13 trillion as of this writing. This value is outside the overall crypto market cap and excludes all other crypto coins. From a fledgling currency in 2008, its value has risen from nearly zero to over $73,000, reaching a historical all-time high in 2024.Bitcoin has minted many new millionaires and several billionaires. Famous founders of multi-billion dollar corporations involved in crypto include Brian Armstrong of Coinbase, Changpeng Zhao (CZ) of Binance, and Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy. With such a meteoric rise, it's hardly surprising that hackers keep trying to find ways to steal Bitcoin. As a Bitcoin owner, protecting your assets from cyber threats is critical. Here, we explore how BTC holders can protect their coins across platforms and activities.The Current BTC Security LandscapeHacks and losses in the crypto sphere are nothing new. In the second quarter of 2024 alone, the crypto ecosystem lost about $572.7 million due to fraudulent attacks and hacks. The figure is up 112 percent compared to the same period last year. The year's most significant BTC hack so far is that of DMM Bitcoin, a Japanese crypto trading platform. On May 31, 2024, DMM Bitcoin lost around $305 million worth of BTC. Moreover, the year-to-date (YTD) losses from crypto fraud and hacks have reached $920.9 million—up 24 percent from $720 million the previous year. May and June have seen exceptionally high losses, making up $358.5 million of total crypto incidents. Centralized finance (CeFi) platforms accounted for 70 percent of all losses.Hacking vs. fraud analysis: Hacks cause 98.5 percent of losses According to a report by Immunefi, a leading bug bounty platform, hacks are responsible for most crypto losses. As of the second quarter of 2024, hacks remain the predominant cause of losses versus fraud. Fraud accounts for only 1.5 percent of the overall crypto losses in Q2 2024. Hacks, on the other hand, account for 98.5 percent.Hacks In Q2 2024, the crypto ecosystem lost $564,238,811 to hacks spread across 53 incidents. This figure represents a 155 percent increase versus Q2 2023 when losses caused by hacks amounted to less than half: $220,522,129. Fraud Fraud-related loss in Q2 2024 was $8,450,050, spread across 19 specific incidents. These numbers represent a decrease of 81 percent compared to the same period last year.Bitcoin hackings you should know aboutDespite advancements in blockchain technology and security measures, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies remain vulnerable to hacking and security breaches. To understand how Bitcoin hacks happen, you should understand their progression and history. Here, we examine some of the most significant Bitcoin hacks and analyze what went wrong.The KuCoin hackIn September 2020, Singapore-based KuCoin, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a security breach. The intrusion resulted in the theft of over $280 million worth of cryptocurrencies, including 1008 Bitcoin. The hackers gained access to the exchange's hot wallets by exploiting weaknesses in its security protocols. According to KuCoin's CEO, its cold wallets were unaffected.In retrospect, enhanced security audits to identify vulnerabilities could have prevented the hack. It could also have been mitigated by using multi-signature or multisig wallets for the exchange's hot storage and storing the more significant portion of assets in cold storage to minimize the accessible amount.This Kucoin hack is not the first of it’s kind and certainly not the last. Just in June 2024 Kraken’s chief security officer disclosed “extremely critical” zero-day flaw in Kraken’s platform to steal $3M dollars. Here is how it was described: The ‘security researcher’ disclosed this bug to two other individuals who they work with who fraudulently generated much larger sums. They ultimately withdrew nearly $3 million from their Kraken accounts… They demanded a call with their business development team (i.e. their sales reps) and have not agreed to return any funds until we provide a speculated $ amount that this bug could have caused if they had not disclosed it. This is not white-hat hacking; it is extortion!  Photo by Clint Patterson on Unsplash  The Coinbase hacks of 2019 and 2021Coinbase is one of the most trusted platforms in the Bitcoin and crypto ecosystem. It is particularly dominant in the USA. As of this writing, Coinbase handles billions of dollars in transactions and has a market cap of $55.24 billion.The first significant breach that shook Coinbase and the crypto community occurred in 2019. The hack showed the ingenuity of the attackers. It was also a wake-up call for the whole cryptosphere, as it was more sophisticated than anyone expected. The attackers accessed Coinbase's internal systems using a sophisticated phishing campaign. They targeted employees with spear-phishing emails carefully crafted to appear legitimate communications from a trusted source.Over a dozen Coinbase employees initially received an email from Gregory Harris, supposedly a Research Grants Administrator at the University of Cambridge in the UK. The first email was dated May 30, 2019. According to Coinbase, the email came from the legitimate Cambridge domain. It had no apparent malicious elements, passed spam detection, and appeared from a knowledgeable source, referencing the recipients' backgrounds. Over the two weeks, the address continued sending emails, and nothing seemed amiss.The attacker sent a follow-up email on June 17. This time, the new email contained a malicious URL. If opened via a Firefox browser, it would install malware that could take over the target user's computer. According to Coinbase's security team, the emails were part of a ""sophisticated, highly targeted, thought out"" attack. Upon entering the network, the hackers moved laterally to escalate their access privileges. They exploited a Firefox zero-day vulnerability—an issue that had not yet been patched. Moreover, the attacks used not one but two Firefox zero-days, according to Philip Martin, the company's chief information security officer, in 2019. Coinbase reported the attacks to Mozilla.The vulnerability enabled the hackers to gain administrative access to the exchange’s backend network and critical systems, including databases for storing user information and private keys. In other words, a successful attack would allow a hacker to steal funds from the exchange. The tactic has been used numerous times and led to gigantic losses in crypto exchanges.This particular hack was unique because the attackers demonstrated remarkable patience and precision. They chose a more calculated, insidious, and covert approach over a swift and noisy attack. However, the breach was eventually detected. During a routine security audit, Coinbase's security team noticed unusual patterns of withdrawals. They launched an investigation and discovered the breach. They then acted swiftly to contain the damage. They secured the compromised systems, patched the exploited vulnerabilities, and enhanced their monitoring capabilities.After the hack, Coinbase publicly disclosed its details and mechanics. They assured users and the broader crypto community that the company's insurance policy covered most of the stolen funds and that no customer funds would be lost.Nonetheless, the incident had far-reaching implications. It highlighted the vulnerabilities inherent in even the most secure platforms and underscored the need to continuously improve cybersecurity practices. The Coinbase security team walked back the entire attack, contained it, and reported the zero-day to Firefox. The second breach that affected Coinbase was in late 2021. It involved the theft of approximately $100 million worth of cryptocurrencies, including BTC. Coinbase detected a platform vulnerability that enabled hackers to exploit a flaw in the crypto transfer process. The vulnerability led to unauthorized transactions and financial losses for some users on the platform.The Bitfinex hack of 2016Though it happened further back in the past, the Bitfinex hack is worth mentioning due to its magnitude. Hackers stole 119,756 BTC, valued at around $72 million. Today, based on the BTC price as of this writing, the same amount of BTC would be roughly $6.5 billion.This particular hack occurred due to vulnerabilities in the multi-signature security system that Bitfinex employed in collaboration with BitGo. It could have been avoided by using advanced authentication protocols, user behavior monitoring, and segregated wallet structures to limit exposure.BTC Security: Who should care?Bitcoin security affects large coin holders and average ones alike. Bitcoin is used for different purposes, not just as a plain vanilla investment tool you buy and hold. It can be a payment vehicle or trading instrument. It can be used as collateral and an underlying asset for various derivatives and derivative-like products. Its value and use cases are expanding as it is now used as the underlying for large-scale ETFs. Thus, you want to ensure your wallet is safe to protect your spending or day-trading money. According to Chainalysis, the number of unique Bitcoin addresses has ballooned to 460 million. While it is impossible to determine how many people own Bitcoin accurately, we can estimate its popularity based on the number of generated addresses over the years. We can also gauge active users through the number of wallets with active balances. According to BitInfoCharts, a blockchain analysis firm, over 67 million wallet addresses have a balance of $1 or more. Of these addresses, 40.5 million have a balance between $1 and $100, showing that most Bitcoin holders have a small amount of money invested.Prominent American entrepreneur Tom Lee predicts that BTC could rally to $150,000 in the coming months. Lee claimed that the asset’s valuation has been negatively affected lately due to the issues related to the now-defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox.The Mt. Goz ""overhang,"" as he calls it, brought down the price due to the long overdue payouts from its bankruptcy proceedings, paying back thousands of users up to almost $9 billion in assets. He expects the overhang to disappear sometime in July. Your small investment could yield appreciable returns if you buy and hold. Because of its long-term potential, security should matter to all BTC holders.The security of an individual also affects the ecosystem. KYC hacks and leaks affect an individual's privacy and identity, enabling malicious attackers to trace their activities. Such hacks can also be detrimental at the large investor or institutional level, leading to massive losses or draining the funds of individual investors signed up on a platform. In addition, BTC and crypto losses negatively impact the markets. Therefore, security is a shared responsibility of BTC holders of all sizes. The Importance of Using Secure PlatformsGiven its high price and widespread appeal, BTC remains a target for hackers. If you are invested in Bitcoin, choosing a secure platform for buying and storing Bitcoin is crucial for protecting your investments.Crypto custody solutionsCrypto custody solutions are businesses providing third-party crypto asset security and storage services. They mainly target accredited investors or institutions with significant Bitcoin or crypto holdings. Such clients include hedge funds, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and exchanges. These custody solutions generally combine hot and cold storage. Hot storage keeps you connected, but cold storage ensures your assets are safely offline.Dealing with crypto custody solutions providers requires understanding various crypto security procedures, hot and cold wallets, multisig solutions, and other best practices to ensure your crypto is safe.Which platform offers the best BTC storage and security?The answer to this question depends on your needs as a Bitcoin investor or holder. If you wish to buy BTC, you have several reliable options.According to investment strategist Lyn Alden, you can use Swan Bitcoin to buy BTC. Beyond a place to make one-time or recurring purchases for dollar-cost averaging (DCA), you should consider it as a Bitcoin accumulation platform. Swan provides Bitcoin IRA services for those investors who are serious about accumulating wealth long term.Fees for all trades are 0.99 percent of each purchase. They do this without taking a spread on your purchase, too, and the first $10,000 worth of BTC has zero fees.User-friendly securitySome notable security-related features include free auto-withdrawal to a self-custody address. Keeping your BTC with Swan's custodian is also free, and you can access it through them with the BTC held in your name. One simple yet ingenious way to use these features is to dollar cost average DCA into Bitcoin utilizing a plan that automatically buys BTC at regular intervals. The platform can also send it to your hardware wallet or another secure custody solution. According to their website, all Swan data is encrypted with military-grade AES-256 encryption, and traffic on the site is encrypted with industry-standard TLSv1.2 encryption. Moreover, Swan does not have access to nor store private keys for BTC that are stored with its custodial partners. Currently, Bakkt and Fortress Trust are the custodians of record. BitGo is its cold storage custodian. Some would consider Swan Bitcoin a Coinbase alternative for buying and storing BTC in the US. While Coinbase is the dominant player in the exchange business, Swan simplifies BTC investment for retail and institutional investors. Essential Security Tips To Safeguard Your BTCThe persistent attempts to hack BTC are a stark reminder of the ever-present risks lurking in the digital world. For users, it underscores the importance of personal security measures. Among these are enabling two-factor authentication and using hardware wallets for long-term storage of cryptocurrencies.The following are some concepts and tips that will help you protect your BTC holdings:Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA)Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides a second or additional layer of account security by requiring a second form of ownership verification outside your password. It is best defined as a process that increases the likelihood that a person is who they say they are. Rather than simply using a username and password, the 2FA process requests users to provide two authentication factors before accessing a crypto-related wallet, app, or platform.Organizations must use 2FA to protect their data and users in the face of a high-risk cybersecurity landscape, specifically in BTC and crypto, wherein you can expect a higher volume of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.One helpful way to frame 2FA is as a process that encourages people and organizations to stop solely relying on passwords to enter applications and websites.With 2FA, cybercriminals have more difficulty stealing users’ identities or accessing their devices. The measure also helps organizations fend off attackers, even when a password has been stolen from one or several users. Companies and individuals are using 2FA to prevent common cyber threats. These include phishing attacks that use users' passwords and spoof targets' identities after gaining credentials. Setting up 2FA for BitcoinTo set up 2FA for your BTC wallet, download a trustworthy authenticator like Authy, Google Authenticator, or other comparable apps. Access your BTC account and look for the 2FA section. Click ""Enable 2FA"". Link your account to the authenticator app by selecting ""Scan QR Code"" or ""Add Account"" on Google Authenticator. Afterward, scan the QR code shown on the BTC or crypto platform.Some systems provide additional backup codes called recovery keys. These codes are vital for account retrieval. You must store these codes in a safe location. If you misplace or lose your device with the corresponding authenticator app, you can use the backup codes to recover your Bitcoin wallet or account access.To complete your setup, you must enter the time-based one-time password (OTP) generated by the authenticator app when asked by your BTC or crypto platform. Log out of your account and try to re-access it to test your 2FA setup. This time, the wallet, app, or platform should ask you for an OTP from your authenticator app.Other 2FA techniques utilize SMS or email verification. While these are better than nothing, they are less safe and vulnerable to more attacks. SMS is susceptible to SIM-swapping attacks. Utilizing an authenticator app is deemed more secure.Hardware-based 2FA is a more stringent security measure that involves physical devices like YubiKey for verification. However, authenticator apps will do very well for regular everyday use.Ensure that your authenticator app is up to date and that your recovery keys are kept in a safe place, preferably offline. Hot vs. cold walletsAs a BTC holder, you must understand the difference between hot and cold crypto wallets. Hot wallets are software that stores your BTC private keys on a device that's online or connected to the Internet. They are convenient and easily accessible via online devices like mobile phones, tablets, or laptops.   Photo by Bastian Riccardi on Unsplash  Hot wallets often have more activity—they usually handle smaller, more frequent BTC transactions—and are convenient for trading. However, because they are online, they are vulnerable to hacks.On the other hand, cold wallets aren't connected to other devices or the Internet, making them less vulnerable to hacks and a more secure method of storing BTC private keys.Cold wallets are usually hardware devices that resemble modified USB sticks or mini plastic cards with buttons and screens. They cost between $50 and about $300, although they could be more expensive. Popular brands include Ledger and Trezor.Cold wallets like paper or metal wallets that record your private keys can be more straightforward. Their enhanced security is derived from their being offline. To trade funds from a cold wallet, you need to move them to a hot wallet that's connected to a crypto exchange.When you set up your hardware wallet, remember to write down your recovery seed phrase on paper and store it offline in a highly secure location. Please do not share this information with anyone or store it digitally.Stay updated with the latest security measuresThe Bitcoin and crypto space are continually evolving, and so are the hacking methods that threaten them. Thus, it is crucial to stay abreast of the latest security measures.Keep all your software updated to protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities. Read reputable sources for updates and security news. Protecting Your BTC Requires a Proactive ApproachIn a dynamic tech and crypto sphere, the only way to stay ahead of hackers is to be proactive about your security. Ensure you have all the basics covered: choosing a secure platform, enabling two-factor authentication, and using cold storage or hardware wallets to protect your BTC wealth.However, as hacks and exploits become more sophisticated, you can only fully secure your BTC when constantly updated on the latest security news. Also, ensure that your platforms and apps are continually on top of threats. If you are a buy-and-hold investor, ensure that your BTC funds are in cold storage.Security in BTC can be effectively summarized by the old and oft-quoted adage from the early days of Bitcoin: ""Not your keys, not your coins."" Make sure you have ultimate control over your private keys. And if you do choose a platform to hold them temporarily or entrust them with custody, understand the nuances of the agreement and infrastructure. Bitcoin was meant to be decentralized, so the more autonomous you are about managing your keys, the better security you have.This is a guest post by Ivan Serrano.

Finney, who passed away in 2014 due to complications from ALS, is celebrated for his profound contributions to Bitcoin and his foresight into the future potential of the nascent technology.10 years ago today, Hal Finney passed away.Finney was the recipient of the first ever Bitcoin transaction, receiving 10 #BTC from Satoshi Nakamoto.Today, we are all running #Bitcoin 🧡 pic.twitter.com/iRxgwQVNR7— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 28, 2024  Early in Finney's career he worked as a video game developer before he joined PGP Corporation, where he worked on early public-key cryptography software. His interest in digital privacy led him to the cypherpunks mailing list, where he collaborated with other pioneers in the field. In 2004, Finney created the world's first reusable proof-of-work (RPOW) system, a precursor to the proof-of-work consensus mechanism that underpins Bitcoin.However, Finney is perhaps best known for his early involvement with Bitcoin. As one of the first to recognize the revolutionary potential of Satoshi Nakamoto's creation, Finney became an active participant in the project. He famously received the first Bitcoin transaction from Nakamoto himself and contributed to the development of the protocol.

I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube,” Finney published on the Bitcoin Talk Forum on March 19, 2013. “It’s been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad… I still love programming and it gives me goals… I’m comfortable with my legacy.”As the community reflects on his legacy, here is one of the only known recorded videos of Finney speaking at the Crypto 98 conference, discussing zero-knowledge proofs, shedding light on his pioneering work on cryptographic protocols.✨New video of #Bitcoin pioneer Hal Finney unearths a 25-year-old talk on zero-knowledge crypto The 1st time I've ever heard him speak 🧡 pic.twitter.com/SkGrnae81L— The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) September 20, 2023  "
Bitcoin Magazine,Bitwise Brings The Bitcoin Ethos To Wall Street ,"Wed, 28 Aug 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitwise-brings-the-bitcoin-ethos-to-wall-street-,"Bitwise co-founder Hong Kim is a hardcore Bitcoiner who’s determined to uphold Bitcoin’s ideals as his company, which issued one of the 11 US spot bitcoin ETFs, brings bitcoin to the world of traditional finance.","Company Name: Bitwise Asset ManagementFounders: Hong Kim and Hunter HorsleyDate Founded: December 2016Location of Headquarters: San Francisco, CA and New York, NYAmount of Bitcoin Held in Treasury: UndisclosedNumber of Employees: 65Website: https://bitwiseinvestments.com/Public or Private? PrivateIn 2016, Hong Kim and his co-founder at Bitwise Asset Management (Bitwise), Hunter Horsely, were living the startup life — working from a living room in San Francisco and looking for a project that they could develop into a business.While experimenting with various ideas, none of which were gaining much traction, their friends wouldn’t shut up about Bitcoin. Plus, by early 2016, every venture capital firm in Silicon Valley was focused on Bitcoin, as well.“We wanted to avoid it for a long time because [there was] too much hype,” Kim told Bitcoin Magazine. “But then, just by osmosis, we spent more and more time thinking about it.”By the end of the year, after doing their homework on Bitcoin, Kim and Horsely had incorporated Bitwise, a bitcoin-first crypto asset management firm that would provide wrappers for bitcoin so that customers could purchase these assets via traditional brokerages.Eight years later, Bitwise was one of the 11 US firms to issue a spot bitcoin ETF; it’s currently the 5th largest US spot bitcoin ETF as per the amount of assets under management (AUM). This is in part due to the Bitcoin enthusiasts who’ve purchased it because of how Bitwise has maintained the Bitcoin ethos as it’s interfaced with Wall Street.Bitwise vs. All Other Spot Bitcoin ETF IssuersThere are a number of factors that differentiate the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) from its competitors.For one, Bitwise is the only company that issues a US spot bitcoin ETF that publishes the addresses of its bitcoin holdings, embracing the idea of transparency, a core Bitcoin tenet.Announcement: Today the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) becomes the first U.S. bitcoin ETF to publish the bitcoin addresses of its holdings.Now anyone can verify BITB's holdings and flows directly on the blockchain.Onchain transparency is core to Bitcoin's ethos. We're proud to… pic.twitter.com/1JTUh3zvDE— Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) January 24, 2024  “Even now, many, many months have passed and still we're the only Bitcoin ETF that discloses its holding addresses,” said Kim. “You can go to a Bitcoin block explorer and check our on-chain holdings.”Kim also made the point that Bitwise is the only spot bitcoin ETF issuer that proactively communicates with its customers via social media.“We are on Twitter talking about a product and answering questions,” explained Kim.“I'll explain anything and engage with the community. If there's anything they're upset about [regarding] the products, they can yell at us and we respond and take them seriously,” he added.What is more, Kim pointed out that Bitcoin remains Bitwise’s primary focus, which makes the company much different from other spot bitcoin ETF issuers like BlackRock or Invesco who manage a plethora of other types of assets.“We've been around for seven years or so and this is the only thing that we talk about,” said Kim.“When prices go down when there's a bear market, We don't rotate to emerging markets or fixed income or whatever,” he added.“There might not be that big of a difference between BlackRock and Invesco or BlackRock or Franklin Templeton, but there's a big difference between BlackRock and Bitwise.”Lastly, Bitwise has committed to giving 10% of its ETF fee profits to three nonprofits that support Bitcoin Core developers — OpenSats, Brink and the Human Rights Foundation (HRF) — for 10 years.Donating To Open-Source DevelopersWhile many in the Bitcoin community have praised Bitwise for donating to Bitcoin Core developers, Kim sees this contribution as more of an obligation and less as a sacrifice.“As a Bitcoiner, I feel that it's not really a donation,” said Kim.“The US taxpayer doesn't think that they're donating to the military budget,” he added.“That’s not a donation. That’s your security budget.”Kim went on to explain that while Bitwise does manage some other crypto assets, two-thirds of the company’s holdings is bitcoin. For this reason, he views supporting Bitcoin Core developers as contributing the technology that buoys his livelihood.“If you're like BlackRock, where you have all sorts of other [assets] and bitcoin is only one of them, then maybe you don't feel that way,” Kim said in regard to why a company like Bitwise cares about bitcoin more than some of the bigger traditional financial institutions that issued spot bitcoin ETFs.“If you are like me or are in an economic situation like me and you care enough about Bitcoin, then it’s not an optional matter that the Bitcoin network is as secure as it can be,” he added.Kim, Bitwise’s CTO, who has a background in cybersecurity, explained why open-source developers are essential to Bitcoin, noting that many who don’t understand how open-source technology works misperceive what Bitcoin developers do. He made the argument that the majority of Bitcoin developers aren’t there to make radical changes to Bitcoin, but to keep it functional as it interfaces with other software.“You can have an opinion about the latest contentious soft fork proposal or whatever, but 95% of the devs that we're talking about don't work on that,” Kim explained.“The 50 or so core devs that do this day in and day out, that's not what they're spending time on. Whenever there's a new version of Linux or Mac or Windows, guess what — we need to make sure that Bitcoin Core compiles on that version,” he continued.“Somebody needs to make sure that the software we depend upon continues to be compatible, well-documented, and runnable.”On A MissionWhile Bitwise does a lot to differentiate itself from its competitors, Kim wants Bitwise to do something more profound than just being one of the better US spot bitcoin ETF issuers.“There are ways of thinking about a business as the product [it offers] or how it’s different from its competitors, but I think there's another way of looking at a company as like, ‘What are you here to do?’” explained Kim.He shares that he and Horsely didn’t start by asking themselves this question, though, now, it seems to be at the forefront of his mind.“I want Bitwise to be the company that helps accelerate and guide this movement, because it's such an important thing for the world to have public money that everyone can access and that nobody controls,” said Kim.After sharing this, Kim acknowledged what he felt many might be thinking as they read this: You’re offering exposure to bitcoin’s price within the walled garden of traditional finance.“TradFi and Bitcoin culture are inevitably colliding and people rightfully have concerns and some kind of dissonance about that,” said Kim. “That was really top of mind for me.”Kim reiterated that this is why Bitwise chose to donate to open-source Bitcoin developers, make their Bitcoin addresses public and engage with the Bitcoin community. And he also shared some information on what Bitwise is working on next: redeemable bitcoin.Redeemable BitcoinBitwise is currently speaking with policymakers in Washington, DC in efforts to have Bitwise facilitate in-kind redemptions of bitcoin from the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF. In layperson’s terms, Kim wants Bitwise customers to be able to withdraw the bitcoin in which they’ve invested via the ETF if they so please, whereas, right now, customers can only withdraw the cash value of the bitcoin in which they’ve invested via bitcoin ETF.“There are gold ETFs where you can redeem, even as an individual retail investor, and get gold coins and bars delivered to your door,” explained Kim. “You redeem in-kind without incurring a taxable event. There's no reason that a bitcoin ETF shouldn't be able to do that,” he added.“That would be a product that I would be proud of.”Kim believes that if Bitwise can make redeemable bitcoin a reality for investors, then spot bitcoin ETFs like BITB have the potential to become some of the biggest on-ramps to Bitcoin.“Bitcoin ETFs are a huge improvement [in Bitcoin onboarding] in that most people have brokerage accounts,” said Kim, who added that it’s much easier to get family and friends to invest in bitcoin when they don’t have to go through the hassle of setting up an account with a Bitcoin or crypto exchange.“If your uncle at the Thanksgiving table is convinced and wants to put $100 into bitcoin, you no longer have to go, ‘Wait a minute. First buy a ledger for $40…’ [Now, it’s] just two taps and you have a hundred dollars worth of Bitcoin exposure,” he added.“But then, at any point in their journey, if they are so inclined, they can withdraw that. And in that sense, it can become a really clean and simple on-ramp.”While Kim acknowledged that many are skeptical this will ever happen — speculating that Wall Street wants as much bitcoin within walled gardens as possible — he also noted that many felt the same way about the spot bitcoin ETFs ever being issued. He requested some patience as Bitwise persists in its efforts to knock down the wall between Bitcoin and traditional finance.“There's a way of looking at Bitcoin ETFs as a clean and easy on-ramp and off-ramp and the lowest friction one for the average person,” said Kim.“That would be my ideal world, and that is a world that Bitwise is currently working on,” he added.“In that world, the ETFs and the on-chain world aren’t as separate, but rather they can have a close relationship.”"

Bitcoin Magazine,A Manual Guide to Killing Bitcoin: The Eternal Return,"Tue, 27 Aug 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/a-manual-guide-to-killing-bitcoin-the-eternal-return,"From the fall of peer-to-peer networks to the dangers of blind optimism, this guide explores how Bitcoin could face existential threats unless we change course. Overconfidence and arrogance could be Bitcoin's biggest threats. From ""The Halving Issue"".","This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine’s “The Halving Issue”. Click here to get your copy.Every morning at 6am, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, the cynic weatherman Phil Connors wakes up to experience the same day over and over and over again. Stuck in a time loop, Connors tries everything to get his life back to normal – he gets stabbed, shot, burned, frozen and electrocuted, only to wake up again the next day as if nothing had happened. Connors quickly comes to the only plausible conclusion: he must be a god.Thinking ourselves to be undefeatable has never been a particularly smart strategy, in times of war or otherwise. If we believe in cosmology, from Nietzsche to Hinduism, time is a loop, and there is a finite realm of possibilities which infinitely repeat – the only thing that we can really do is change how we react. Unless we learn from our mistakes, we are doomed to experience the same things over and over again.Though often priding ourselves in exceptional intellect – I’ve found Bitcoin early, I must be very smart – it seems that learning from mistakes comes hard even for the most seasoned ‘Bitcoin advocates’. Public discourse seems to have shifted from the discussion of technological challenges and limitations to Deutsche Bank afterwork chats – Anything is possible, we’ll just need returns to remain on track.When Bitcoin was first discussed in German Parliament back in 2014, ‘experts’ highlighted the ease with which bitcoin payments could be deanonymized via network analysis, speaking to the risks of widespread bitcoin adoption to lead towards total financial surveillance. Today, ten years later, as Bitcoin has returned to German parliament, ‘experts’ have been exchanged for influencers proposing Bitcoin as CBDC alternatives. Current ‘Bitcoin political debates’ cannot help but remind us of Bart Simpson running in circles banging a pan on his head.As we continue to close in on the opportunist’s echo chamber, we have successfully swapped academic debate for cheerleading squads. Things will go great so long as you’re willing to take your tits out. ‘We’re winning!’ has long become the prevalent meme – Between ETF approvals, stablecoin issuances, and possible nation state adoption we are so confident in Bitcoin’s success that we seem incapable of realizing that this is precisely how you lose. Arrogance comes before most declines, and its exploitation has always been by design. By sowing manic delusions of invincibility, even the most trained commander will lead their sheep to slaughter.    Groundhog DayA long long time ago, in a galaxy far away, we plugged our computers into landlines to access the three great W’s. For anyone who didn’t live alone, this practice was often doomed to reap a fair amount of havoc – Get off the computer, mom is waiting for a phone call.So we can all agree that that sucked. But, due to a lack of technological advancements and accessibility to communicate wirelessly across distances (think of your favorite mesh network here), it was the most convenient option we had. The only problem: it led to a monopoly on web access points lying with telecommunications providers. Fast forward 20 years, and we now know that telecom providers monitor, analyze, and report anything that we do on the internet to government authorities under the guise of national security. A technology thought invincible for the liberation of the people quickly turned into its biggest enemy.   Now we can’t really talk about the success (and downfall) of peer-to-peer technologies without talking about Linkin Park. Linkin Park’s music, then still Hybrid Theory, circulated widely on the first P2P music file sharing network Napster. Downloaded from other people’s computers, accessing Linkin Park’s music was completely free. Their first studio album, Hybrid Theory, yet remains one of the top five most sold records in the world with 15 Million copies sold in the first three weeks alone.Napster was a real world internet revolution – And the music industry was furious. As people happily infected their devices with potential computer AIDS, bands, rappers, and singer songwriters like the Arctic Monkeys, Dispatch or EMINEM were building fanbases even before breaking their first big record releases, and the musical establishment wasn’t having it. When Metallica sued the P2P platform for copyright infringement, clearly unhappy that their cult status and its consequential returns felt threatened, peer-to-peer music file sharing did not exactly die, but was quickly incorporated into more corporate friendly formats – from buying music via iTunes to music streaming via Spotify.While it seemed unimaginable to put a technology like Napster back into the box, convenience, again, became king. Today, the majority of listeners do not own the music that they listen to, but subscribe to corporate databases of which neither artists, labels nor producers profit. Instead, the big winner of the music file sharing industry again turned out to be surveillance. Just last week, when Spotify updated its cookie policy, a push notification let EU users know which 695 data brokers would gain access to their information. Downloading files like ClapYourHandsSayYeah.mp3.exe (RIP) clearly was risky business, but the risks of surveillance capitalism reach much farther than a trashed computer.In essence, the same thing happened to search engines. Going online in the early days of the world wide web was like getting dropped off in the middle of Yellow Stone national park without a map. There were thousands of places to go, but you needed to know where they were. With comprehensive link collections, platforms like Yahoo, AskJeeves or Google offered tremendous value to those less versed in their way around the WWW. Instead of asking your peers where something cool on the internet was, you simply asked Google. But, with moving away from word-of–mouth formats, we ended up with what has today been termed the great enshittification. The first few links are paid affiliate sites, and the ones after that are those who figured out how to efficiently play Google’s SEO formats, of course all packed and tailored to your supposed needs. Today, Google is one of the most valuable surveillance companies in the world. A software meant to aid in the liberalization of free information essentially became a tool for censorship.Again and again, thinking that ‘technology has won’ only exacerbated its demise. We choose what is comfortable now only to stab ourselves in the back down the road. And before you know it – BING! It’s the whistling belly button at the high school talent show as the weatherman strikes again. To put it bluntly: we’re fucking up.It’s the Filters, StupidIn today’s pop-culture Bitcoin discourse, ignorance runs rampant. Lightning works until it doesn’t, let’s spend millions to put the Dollar on Bitcoin; It’s called priorities babe, look it up.When Ordinals hit Bitcoin – think of them what you will – we suddenly realized that we were in trouble. In the global south, people quickly became unable to transact non-custodially. All the people you’ve told to DCA suddenly saw themselves facing exorbitant transaction fees, unable to move their funds. For those valuing their privacy even for smaller spends, participating in coinjoin rounds turned prohibitively expensive. No matter where we look, we still have a scaling problem. This problem does not exist because of Ordinals. It exists because we were so convinced of winning that we lost track of keeping our ignorance in check.Over the past four years, the majority was more concerned with furthering its own narrative – everything is awesome and Bitcoin is the bestest currency on earth – than facing uncomfortable truths. We then proceeded to respond with an exorbitant amount of shortsightedness: it’s the filters, stupid.Filtering out Ordinals transactions is a short term solution for a long term problem. Sure, blocking arbitrary data on the blockchain will necessarily drive fees down, but if global Bitcoin adoption is what you want, you’re not doing yourself any favors by proposing selective solutions to systemic issues. The thing is that being angry at JPEGs is easy. Taking on problems that challenge the ‘greatness of Bitcoin’, which some appear to have turned into their whole personality, is not. For every tweet that claims for Bitcoin to bring world peace – clearly by pure magic, or what the Wall Street losers turned Bitcoin economists call some backwards form of game theory – a little of the system dies.We do not need your hopium; We need real world solutions to real world problems. That includes laying down the crack pipe and talking about the uncomfortable stuff: we are not winning – we are doing the opposite, because our ‘long time preference’ reaches about as far as our investment portfolios. You can kill Bitcoin. And it’s easier than you’d think.   Embrace, Extend, Extinguish Over the past few years, debates around Bitcoin ‘winning’ looked pretty much the same. Senators are embracing Bitcoin: see, we are winning. BlackRock is embracing Bitcoin: see, we are winning. First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they realize that all you want is a pat on the back before the policeman comes to take your toys away. The laughing hasn’t stopped, it just happens behind your back. The most plausible death of Bitcoin would happen less in name than in its total incorporation, at a point where the technology is simply not yet ready for ‘mass adoption’ – just like we have killed all peer-to-peer technologies that came before it. The death of Bitcoin is not the death of the tech, but the death of its usability.At the center of the death of Bitcoin, at least in essence, continues to stand the scaling debate. When Gigablocks were first proposed, it seemed fairly obvious that a blockchain that takes 10 years to sync will lack in decentralization. In came the Lightning Network, which seemed to solve all of our issues: Scaling off-chain, securing on-chain. Smart. Except that we can only fit around 5000 channel opening and closing transactions inside of a block – hardly enough to let 8 Billion people use Bitcoin non-custodially.Unfortunately, that didn't stop influencers – or really anyone - from proclaiming their Hail Mary of desperation; Scaling Bitcoin obviously is a problem for future me. Too high was the thrill of finally being able to sit at the corporate dinner table and smug the obligatory 'I told you so'. Putting non-believers into their place simply had to come first; if Bitcoin doesn't exist to feed our fragile egos and pump up our sad little bank accounts, what really was the point? Freedom, Carajo! Welcome to your involuntary conversion at the church of satoshi's witnesses, where we drop speeches on saving the world from tyranny more often than Biden changes his diapers.So here we are. Six years after we bought our first stickers at the Blockstream store – the only thing you were able to buy when the first Lightning implementations launched, besides beer – and we're still scrambling. Instead of fostering broad discussions around covenant proposals, which do come with real trade-offs and risks, we are busy labeling anyone not willing to ossify a spook, while ossification at this point in Bitcoin will certainly be the surest way to kill it.Sometime in the near future, we'll wish ourselves back to a time of a few hundred vBytes in fees. By then, we will have no choice but to use Bitcoin custodially. Say goodbye to freedom money: Bitcoin as we know it will be dead, unless we stop making the same mistakes. "
Bitcoin Magazine,An Untold Story of Bitcoin in Thailand,"Tue, 27 Aug 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/an-untold-story-of-bitcoin-in-thailand,"The story of Didier Somnuke, a Thai Bitcoiner, and his journey through Bitcoin.","In the rapidly expanding global Bitcoin community, Western biases often dominate the narrative, overlooking diverse stories from around the world. One such story belongs to Didier Somnuke, a small business owner in the heart of Bangkok, a city known for welcoming 22.8 million international tourists in 2023, surpassing cities like Paris, London, and New York City. Although Thailand has experienced a massive spike in household debt, reaching 16.37 trillion baht (US$463 billion) or 90.8% of the national GDP, up from less than 14 trillion baht in 2019.Didier Somnuke, born in Yala province, where geopolitical conflict is a harsh reality. Southern Thailand is one of the poorest parts of Thailand with a poverty rate of 34% compared to the national average of 6%, according to the World Bank, has been plagued by instability. Since 2004, this turmoil has claimed over 7,000 lives and injured 13,500 people.As a Thai saying goes, “ทวงสิทธิ์ที่จะมีชีวิตที่ดีกลับคืนมา” (Reclaim the right to a better life), In 2012, Didier left his conflict-ridden hometown for Bangkok, where pursuing higher education was a beacon of hope for a better life. At that time, Bitcoin and financial concepts were distant ideas in Didier's universe. Navigating the vibrant streets of Bangkok, Didier completed his master's degree and joined the workforce, taking up a typical 9-to-5 job. For a domestic migrant, this was a significant achievement. Reflecting on his journey, he recalled his teacher’s words, “When you are old, you have time and money, but you will lack the energy to start a business. If you want to do it, just do it.” With this advice in mind, Didier resigned from his monotonous corporate job after a year and opened a new chapter in his life.Didier borrowed 50,000 THB (approximately 1,500 USD) from his brother to begin a street burger shop. He chose to start a burger business because he believed it was easy to launch with a small investment. Driven by his ambition and inspired by the bustling energy of Bangkok, a city that never sleeps. He spent about a year developing the recipe and began the business in 2015. In the first three to four years, he managed everything on his own as a solo entrepreneur, and his income was lower than the wage he earned in his corporate job. He often wondered if he had made a mistake by quitting his job to start a business that generated less income. However, after five years, everything started to improve. Sales at the shop began to increase, and Didier started hiring employees.He admitted, ""I entered the crypto market with greed; all I wanted was to get rich quickly."" In 2017, he and his friends pooled their resources to buy three ASIC miners from Bitmain to try mining Bitcoin and altcoins like Litecoin and Dogecoin. They saw a return on their investment within six months. Didier bought his first Bitcoin in early 2017 to purchase those ASIC miners but didn't know how to transfer his Bitcoin, so he ended up using a bank transfer instead.Reflecting on his early experiences, he recalled, ""My first Bitcoin were slowly converted to shitcoins during the bull market. I was so lucky. I got a 100% profit almost immediately whenever I bought something."" Despite having zero knowledge about cryptocurrency, he gained confidence and became a super shitcoiner, paying very little attention to Bitcoin.In mid-2017, he learned about leverage and trading. His profits skyrocketed due to leverage. Although luck was not always on his side forever, in early 2018, the market crashed, and he lost over 1 million Thai baht (almost 30,000 USD), while his initial capital was just about 100,000 Thai baht (about 3,000 USD). On top of that, he also lost his shitcoins from the mining pool. He had kept all of his shitcoins in the mining pool's custody, and one day, when he checked his account, every shitcoin he owned, worth 10,000 USD were gone. The notice on the mining website, ""Hash-to-Coin,"" stated that if coins were kept with them for more than three months, they would be considered a donation.   He disheartenedly said, ""I lost everything."" But unlike most people, ""I didn't blame Bitcoin. I still see it as the future. I blame myself. I didn't know anything and I did over leverage."" He emphasized that despite his heavy financial losses, his girlfriend did not leave him. ""My girlfriend was my customer. She regularly came to buy burgers. I met her while I was struggling financially during my early days as an entrepreneur. She supported me and said we could make the money back.""Determined to turn his circumstances around, he discovered Mr. Piriya on YouTube and started following his live streams about the real Bitcoin education. This marked the moment he began to truly understand what Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are. Enlightened by this unique knowledge, he came to see Bitcoin as a saving technology rather than just a trading tool. Over three years, Didier recovered from his losses and emerged stronger. He got to be friend with Mr. Piriya, and together they founded a company called Right Shift to develop Bitcoin content in Thai language through multiple social media channels, including on Nostr with with one of the popular hashtag #siamstr. As a team, they translated ""The Bitcoin Standard"" and ""The Fiat Standard"" into Thai, both of which became best-selling books in Thailand. They organized the first-ever Bitcoin Thailand Conference in 2023 and are now preparing for the next one in September 2024.   Didier now accepts Bitcoin as a payment method in his main burger shop, one of four different franchises. He uses Wallet of Satoshi to process these payments. Within a year of implementing this initiative, he has received over 3 million sats in payments, though he initially expected to see more transactions in Bitcoin. In his marketplace, some neighboring small business owners occasionally ask him about Bitcoin as they notice the large Bitcoin poster in his shop. Although they often lose interest once he explains, according to his several unsuccessful experience. Instead now, he focuses his energy online, where he can make more impact to people who are willing to embrace innovation.   In 2022, approximately 8.4 million people in Thailand, accounting for 12% of the country's population, used cryptocurrency. Estimates suggest that by 2028, this number will rise to about 17.67 million, representing 25% of the population. During our conversation, Didier claimed that there are about 50,000 Bitcoin users in Thailand and speculated that the Thai government might intervene in Bitcoin adoption, potentially mandating the use of KYC wallets because they dislike money systems they can't control. In the worst-case scenario, Didier remains resolute: he will continue advocating for Bitcoin with his friends. ""It is not an option,"" he asserted, ""it is the only way to survive.""This is a guest post by Win Ko Ko Aung.

The Bitcoin Cycle Master chart integrates on-chain metrics, including Coin Value Days Destroyed and Terminal Price, to assess Bitcoin’s position within its economic cycles. Historically, these cycles occur approximately every four years, aligning with Bitcoin halving events.   The Bitcoin Cycle Master tool analyzes actual economic behavior on the Bitcoin blockchain to determine whether Bitcoin is undervalued, fairly valued, aggressively valued, or overvalued. Presently, the data indicates that Bitcoin is at a fair market value, suggesting a balanced state between demand and supply within the current cycle.This tool not only identifies periods of increased risk, where transaction behaviors hint at major cycle highs, but also highlights value opportunities during cycle lows. By tracking on-chain transaction patterns, the Bitcoin Cycle Master provides insights into potential future price movements, potentially helping investors make more informed decisions.Institutions, analysts, and Bitcoin enthusiasts are optimistic about a price increase later in the year, drawing on historical trends where Bitcoin’s value tends to rise many months following a halving event. This sentiment has been further bolstered by recent predictions from prominent figures in the financial sector.

The ETFs provide exposure to Bitcoin prices without directly owning Bitcoin.While volumes have been slower than U.S. Bitcoin ETFs, assets under management have steadily climbed. This suggests a growing institutional appetite for regulated Bitcoin products in Asia.The ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF is the largest of the Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs, with over $142 million in net assets. Bosera Hashkey's Bitcoin ETF comes next with around $99 million in holdings, followed by Harvest Bitcoin ETF with $31 million. Together, the total Bitcoin holdings across the three Hong Kong ETFs stand at approximately 4,450 BTC, worth $272 million at current prices.Industry observers believe innovations like the ETFs' redemption method could attract more capital over time. The Hong Kong products allow for in-kind redemptions using actual Bitcoin, unlike cash-only U.S. ETFs.The growth indicates increasing Bitcoin adoption by institutional investors in Asia. If interest in Hong Kong's spot Bitcoin ETFs continues at the current pace, they could emerge as a significant regional pool of Bitcoin demand.Other Asian countries, such as Singapore, Malaysia, and South Korea, are also in the pipeline to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Bitcoin Magazine,"Report From The DNC: Democrats Warm Up To Bitcoin And Crypto, But Offer No Policy Specifics","Fri, 23 Aug 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/report-from-the-dnc-democrats-warm-up-to-bitcoin-and-crypto-but-offer-no-policy-specifics,"While there was hardly any talk of Bitcoin or crypto at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) this week, Democrats are no longer ignoring the topic.","Bitcoin was not a big topic at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) this week. None of the speakers at the event uttered a word about the electronic cash system or other crypto assets from the event’s main stage at Chicago’s United Center. And you’d have been hard pressed to have overheard a conversation on Bitcoin or crypto anywhere in the halls of the arena either.However, despite the fact that Democrats chose not to include Bitcoin or crypto in their official platform, some high-ranking Democrats did say this week that a Harris administration would be more pro-Bitcoin and pro-crypto than the Biden administration has been — though without offering specifics. Also, at satellite events for the conference, some Democrats spoke passionately about why their party should embrace Bitcoin and crypto.Congressman Wiley Nickel (D-NC), a Bitcoin and crypto proponent, spoke to the idea that a Harris administration will take a different approach to the crypto industry than the Biden administration has.“Vice President Harris has been working for and as part of the Biden-Harris administration, but now she's coming into this campaign with her own positions on issues,” Rep. Nickel told Bitcoin Magazine explained in an interview at the convention.“A lot has happened in the last few week’s, so she’s [only now] starting to come out with policy positions. It's not going to be an immediate process of her coming out with things she would do differently from President Biden, but she will have different positions on issues, and she will make those known,” he added.On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Vice President Harris will introduce policies to support the crypto industry if elected. This was according to her senior campaign advisor for policy, who spoke at a Bloomberg News roundtable at the convention.The article touched on how Harris plans to engage with the cryptocurrency industry — though, again it didn’t offer any particulars on how she plans to do so. It also quoted Harris saying that she plans to “cut needless bureaucracy and unnecessary regulatory red tape” while encouraging “innovative technologies” by offering “transparent rules of the road,” though none of Harris’ quotes in the piece included any direct references to Bitcoin or crypto.Rep. Nickel didn’t offer any specifics on what Harris’ policy might look like either, as he said he didn’t want to speak on behalf of Harris, but did note the success of the Crypto4Harris town hall, an event held on Wednesday, August 15, that featured Democratic lawmakers including Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand (D-NY) and Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) as well as billionaire crypto enthusiast Mark Cuban, sharing that there’s “a real sense of momentum amongst Democrats on the issue.”Rep. Nickel also asked Bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts to heed a certain warning.“The anti-crypto names you hear are just totally invented by folks who are trying to damage her campaign,” said Rep. Nickel about rumors of Harris bringing the likes of Brian Reese and Bharat Ramamurti, economic advisors from the Biden administration who were behind Operation Chokepoint 2.0, back into the fold.“I don't [give] any credence to the weird names that you hear being thrown around for big jobs. I heard Gary Gensler for Treasury Secretary. I can tell you that there's 0% chance that he would be able to be confirmed by the Senate,” he added. “That one is not happening.”Pro-Bitcoin/Pro-Crypto Democrats Speak At Satellite EventsAt an event held at a University of Chicago facility, Cleve Mesidor, Executive Director of the Blockchain Foundation and former Obama appointee who worked as the Director of Public Affairs at Commerce’s Economic Development Administration (EDA), spoke on a panel entitled “Democrats’ Path Forward On Digital Assets & Crypto.” TODAY: I’m Speaking in Chicago During DNC Convention!I’m excited to be part of this panel hosted by @ProgressChamber & @BusinessForward, which also features:@RepWileyNickel | @clydevanel | @JBSDC @paradigm| @KyleBligen= Democrats' Path Forward On Digital Assets & Crypto = pic.twitter.com/WIYggp1V9o— Cleve Mesidor (@cmesi) August 21, 2024  Mesidor shared her perspective on the importance of crypto, which differed notably from the perspectives of notoriously anti-crypto Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA).“Senator Liz Warren and Congressman Brad Sherman are stuck in time,” said Mesidor on the panel.“They are so determined to fight big money, so laser focused on hitting the big guys, that their blind spot is the fact that communities of color are the largest adopters of cryptocurrency. Black and Latino communities lead national adoption of this $2 trillion market,” she added.“Let's be clear, consumer protection is important — we need guardrails. But if you don't couple it with financial inclusion, you're just saying to all of the communities who capitalized on bitcoin over the last 15 years — who made it something, who built products and services on blockchain — that you’re going to continue [supporting] policies to make sure they can't continue to participate.”Mesidor, a Latina herself, was emotional as she spoke, as she feels that Democrats are missing one of the major narratives around Bitcoin and crypto. At the same time, she acknowledged why they might be apprehensive to look favorably upon the crypto industry.“Democrats have PTSD,” she told me in an interview after the panel.“[They have] PTSD because decades ago the predatory lenders, as we call them today, came to them and said we were going to democratize finance. The internet was supposed to democratize us, right? It was supposed to be decentralized. And today, big tech is not diverse,” she added.New York Assemblyman Clyde Vanel (D), a legislator who’s part of the New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic, and Asian Legislative Caucus, was also on the panel.Vanel recalled first being introduced to crypto in the mid-2010s and being impressed by how it catalyzed an increase in the financial savviness of inner city youth.“I went to different high schools and there were high school kids [who owned crypto] using the same muscles that seasoned investors do, watching markets,” recounted Vanel.“We had a convenience store in my neighborhood [that had a] Bitcoin ATM. I went to the convenience store and saw a line of young people buying different denominations of Bitcoin — amazing,” he added.Vanel wasn’t just happy to be seeing his constituents acquiring bitcoin because of the financial benefits they may have reaped from investing in it, but because blockchain technology also gives those from his community an alternative to the traditional financial system, which some — including his own father — don’t trust.“My dad never used a bank, never trusted a bank,” said Vanel. “He used check cashing places.”Vanel also touched on the remittance payment use case for Bitcoin and crypto.“When he sent money to another country, he spent a lot of money doing so,” said Vanel, still speaking about his father “What does it mean to make sure that we make it easier for people like him to transfer value?”Because Vanel understands well the benefits of Bitcoin and crypto, he’s glad to see Democrats starting to come around to it.“I’m very excited that this event is happening on the heels of this campaign to show the importance of financial inclusion [via] digital technology,” said Vanel. “10 years ago, this wouldn't have happened at the National Convention.”Not far from the event at which Mesidor and Vanel spoke, an event entitled CryptoDNC took place, featuring appearances by Reps. Bill Foster (D-IL) and the aforementioned Wiley Nickel.🎉 New speaker announcement!We're pleased to have @RepBillFoster as a featured speaker during our event next Wednesday in Chicago during the 2024 @DemConventionMake sure to RSVP now to secure your spot!Register: https://t.co/mJzVzchfx2Or sign up below 👇👇 pic.twitter.com/V9lnPlgmox— CryptoDNC (@crypto_dnc) August 16, 2024  During a fireside chat at the event, Rep. Nickel shared that not embracing crypto technology would be like not embracing the internet two and a half decades ago.Are The Democrats Serious?Have the Democrats really changed their tune regarding Bitcoin and crypto or are they just pandering to single-issue voters who would otherwise vote Trump because of his pro-crypto stance?This is the question that seems to have remained on the minds of most Bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts. Part of the reason many seem hesitant to trust the Democrats’ proposed 180 on crypto may be because of the Biden administration’s support of SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s regulation by enforcement approach to the crypto industry over the last three and a half years.Rep. Wiley Nickel seems to be making an earnest attempt to get the Democrats to “reset” their approach to crypto, but is Harris really listening? And can the likes of Assemblyman Vanel and Ms. Meridor raise their pro-crypto voices loudly enough to get the attention of a potential Harris administration?We will have to wait and see."
Crypto Potato,Michael Saylor Predicts Bitcoin Will Reach $13 Million Per Coin,"Mon, 09 Sep 2024",https://cryptopotato.com/michael-saylor-predicts-bitcoin-will-reach-13-million-per-coin/,The MicroStrategy chairman thinks Bitcoin will have long-term annual returns 8% higher than the S&#38;P500.,"MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor predicted on Monday that Bitcoin will reach $13 million over the next two decades. The billionaire explained why the leading digital asset’s recent volatility hasn’t frightened his company, and the advantages for investors to buy into MSTR instead. Bitcoin To $13 Million, Says Saylor During an interview with CNBC, Saylor forecasted that Bitcoin will retain its 44% compound annual growth rate in the short term, before that growth steadily declines by roughly 5% per year as the asset matures. “My long-term forecast is it’s going to go to $13 million over 21 years,” said Saylor. “At some point, it’ll be the S&P return plus 8%, and it’ll be the S&P vol plus 8%.” To reach that price by 2045, Bitcoin would need to maintain an average CAGR of 29.56%. Saylor initially put forward a similar price forecast during his speech at Bitcoin 2024 in Nashville. While $13 million was his “base case”, his “bear case” was $3 million (in line with VanEck’s predictions), and his bull case was a whopping $49 million – almost 1000X higher than today. In the meantime, Saylor expects continued BTC volatility – largely because it is a globally traded, 24/7 asset that is highly liquid. “If you’re worried about a missile strike, you can’t teleport your ten million dollar apartment to Singapore, lever it up 10 to 1, and short $100 million worth of New York real estate,” he explained. “But you can short $100 million worth of Bitcoin by borrowing $10 million.” Regarding MicroStrategy (MSTR), Saylor argued that the company has “pioneered” the Bitcoin-backed bond market by issuing billions of dollars in convertible bonds to buy BTC. As an investment, he says MSTR is like a “tax deferred” BTC yield” instrument, effectively letting users borrow money to buy BTC at rates they could not access as an individual. Since adopting a BTC reserve strategy in 2020 Peter Schiff Disapproves Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff called out Saylor for boasting about the gains of both BTC and MSTR, calling his ideas “a bunch of nonsense.” “MSTR is down 40% from its 52-week high and is 6% below its 2021 high. The actually returns are not nearly as rosy as you describe and will soon get worse,” he argued over Twitter on Monday.

Hougan made the statement in response to a Sept. 8 social media post by researcher Jim Bianco, who claimed that less than 10% of US-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs AUM comes from investment advisors. He added that the ETFs are a “small tourist tool” instead of an adoption vehicle. Nearly $1.5 billion from advisors Hougan analyzed BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) net flows related to investment advisors, which are $1.45 billion. Compared to the total $46 billion in inflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs, Hougan agrees with Bianco that this is indeed a small amount. However, excluding all other flows from Bitcoin ETFs and solely focusing on the $1.45 billion flow linked to investment advisors, Hougan explained that this would make IBIT the second fastest-growing ETF launched in 2024 out of over 300 funds. He added: “The only ETF that ‘beats’ it on assets is KLMT, an ESG ETF that was seeded by a single investor with $2 billion and trades on average ~250 shares per day, with zero investment advisor adoption.” Hougan further highlighted that investment advisors are adopting Bitcoin ETFs faster than any other ETF in history despite the relatively lower amount invested compared to other investors. Hougan added: “It is just that their historic flows are overshadowed by the even-more-historic purchases of other investors.” Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas agreed with the Bitwise CIO and confirmed that the nearly $1.5 billion in advisor allocations are “more organic inflows” than any other ETF launched this year. Not too staggering Jim Bianco’s post on X was prompted by the major outflows from US-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs registered last week. According to Farside Investors data, the ETFs collective lost $706 million last week, with nearly $288 million in fleeing capital registered on Sept. 3. Balchunas noted that the major outflows represent 0.5% of Bitcoin ETFs’ total AUM, which he considers is not “too staggering.” The Bloomberg analyst added: “[People] are so warped (err spoiled) by how big the inflows are that any little outflow they freak. Princess and the Pea Syndrome).” Additionally, Balchunas explained that the correct way to measure an ETF’s health is by tracking its flows since dollar-denominated assets under management can shrink if the asset price goes down. He concluded by highlighting that Bitcoin ETFs have over 1,000 institutional holders after two 13F periods, which he added is “beyond unprecedented.” Balchunas added that 20% of IBIT’s shares are held by institutions and large advisors and expects this number to reach 40% in the next 12 months.

The CEOFANBVE said it conducted its search in conjunction with Public Ministry officials.

In a September 9th note to clients, 10x Research CEO Markus Thielen warned that the supposedly bullish liquidity easing cycle may kick off on a sour note for risk assets. While a 25 basis point cut is seen as the more favorable outcome, possibly leading to long-term price appreciation for Bitcoin as liquidity increases and recession fears ease, a more aggressive cut could have an adverse effect. A 50 basis point cut could “signal deeper concerns to the markets,” indicating a lapse in combating the impending economic slowdown. This might cause investors to reduce their exposure to risk assets like Bitcoin. Something Thielen highlighted as no obstacle to the Fed’s decision, as their “primary focus will be mitigating economic risks rather than managing market reactions.” While traders currently place the probability of a 50 basis point cut at 29%, according to CME’s fed watch tool, 10x Research cautions this, citing it to contrast their view of the “prevailing consensus.” Weak Jobs Data Fuels Recession Fears Recession concerns gained traction in early August when the Sahm Rule Recession Indicator, which tracks economic downturns, jumped to 0.53 from 0.43 following weak July U.S. jobs data, signaling a warning of a looming recession. In the wake of the release of August’s weak jobs report, these fears have been exasperated. According to FRED data, the Sahm Rule Recession indicator has jumped higher to 0.57. 10x Research commented:  The chorus is growing louder that the Fed is behind the curve, having missed signs of labour market weakness after being caught off guard in July.  However, other analysts cite the weak jobs data as no obstacle. Alianza advisor and former Pimco CEO Mohamed El-Erian commented that the latest numbers remain consistent with his belief that the US economy will avoid a recession.  Especially after the excitement of a month ago, when analysts and economists suddenly jacked up their probability of an economic recession, this morning’s (August) US jobs report comes as a relief… that is unless you were absolutely convinced that the Federal Reserve would cut…— Mohamed A. El-Erian (@elerianm) September 6, 2024  Bitcoin Could Face a 20% Decline Under an Aggressive Rate Cut In a September 2nd report from Bitfinex, analysts warned that a US rate cut could present a “challenging time” for Bitcoin traders. A 50 basis point rate cut could potentially trigger a correction, pushing Bitcoin deeper into its recent slump as “recession concerns escalate.” The analysts added:  If we were to speculate, we would caution to expect a 15-20 percent decline when rates are cut this month, with a bottom of $40-50k for BTC  This view is consistent with past analysis from 10x Research, which identified the low 40,000s zone as an optimal entry point for the next bull market. Although Bitcoin price action may appear bleak in the near term, Based on historical and technical patterns, a six-figure bitcoin Bitcoin is “still in play.” Popular trader Titan of Crypto pointed to the final quarter of this year as a potential breakout point, describing it as having “epic” potential for price action—a sentiment echoed by other analysts.

Meanwhile, one analyst has come up with an interesting comparison, claiming that XRP is in for a “huge squeeze.” This speculation comes despite XRP still reeling from losses since Monday, down 5.29% – a notable weakness compared to other altcoins that have mounted recoveries. Despite these setbacks, trader interest in XRP appears to be increasing. The altcoin’s trading volume has surged 25.23% to $615 million over the past 24 hours XRP Price to Squeeze Against Bitcoin: Is a Breakout Imminent?

XRP/BTC looks ready for a huge squeeze pic.twitter.com/O0lzuHbTCZ— Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) September 8, 2024  This observation is supported by an ascending triangle pattern that has developed since mid-July, characterized by higher lows as the asset price converges towards stubborn resistance as it approaches a breakout. In an X post the day prior, the analyst pointed to the resistance at $0.55 as a target, overcoming which would lead the XRP price to “pump hard.”  A closer look at the XRP/USDT chart indicates that this move might be approaching. XRP/USDT 1H chart, falling wedge pattern. Source: Binance. XRP is currently confined within a falling wedge pattern, reflecting growing volatility as the asset navigates a period marked by fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). As the asset unwinds its selling pressure, this pattern converges toward a potential breakout point. However, momentum indicators now appear more favorable. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has managed to maintain its position in positive territory, currently at 60. Although still neutral, it represents a shift towards bullishness. Likewise, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has emerged out of its recent rut, now at +0.1. Buying pressure has taken the edge, making a potential breakout promising. Indeed, as the MACD line holds above the Signal line after a recent cross above it, it seems that the bulls are leading XRP’s next move. Fundamentals also lean in XRP’s favor. Most significantly, Ripple announced that their stablecoin will likely launch this year. If it meets widespread adoption, it may serve as a catalyst for price action. However, traders should look for a decisive break above the resistance presented by the 200EMA for confirmation of a breakout from this pattern before a move to $0.55. This New Opportunity Has Higher Gains Potential Although some may want to cling to XRP for further gains, admittedly, XRP’s performance has been shaky throughout the year. Relying solely on XRP may limit your potential gains. Therefore, more strategic investors may find an advantage in diversifying into newer low-cap meme coins that have the potential to rally exponentially.

Could this accumulation signal a major BTC price surge? Read the latest analysis and insights.The postBitcoin Price Analysis: Whales Scoop Up $227M in BTC – Is a Surge Coming?appeared first onCryptonews.," Bitcoin (BTC) has regained momentum, climbing above $55,500 after a recent dip. According to Lookonchain, the recovery follows increased buying from crypto whales, suggesting renewed confidence in Bitcoin’s future growth.  Lookonchain reports that there has been a big increase in Bitcoin (BTC) following a major drop in the market last week. Starting on Sept. 1, three big players in the crypto space collectively amassed a whopping 2,814 BTC, which is equivalent to $157.3 million.#Bitcoin #Crypto pic.twitter.com/cU1rbCKwaM— CoinWave (@CoinWaveBTC) September 9, 2024  Additionally, the recent US jobs report for August, which showed fewer jobs added than expected, supports this recovery. The report reduces the likelihood of a 50-basis-point rate cut, though a 25-basis-point cut remains possible.  This has sparked interest in Bitcoin, as lower rate hike expectations could drive investors toward cryptocurrencies. Key Points:  Bitcoin rebounds above $55,500 after whale buying activity. Weaker US jobs report reduces chances of a 50-basis-point rate cut. Investors see Bitcoin as a hedge against slower Federal Reserve rate hikes.  Bitcoin Recovers as Whale Buys and Economic Data Boost Confidence Crypto whales have recently purchased over 4,014 BTC, valued at $227 million, during Bitcoin’s 11% price drop. Notable transactions include a 999.999 BTC withdrawal from Binance, worth around $55 million.  Historically, such whale activity signals confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value and often precedes a market recovery.  Crypto Whales Continue to Buy the Dip, Scooping Up $227 Million in Bitcoin https://t.co/AT1J9RNmEn— ZoneCrypto Feed (@ZoneCrypto_feed) September 9, 2024  Key Points:  Whales buy over 4,000 BTC amid an 11% price drop. Bitcoin recovers 4%, now trading around $55,000. Weaker US jobs data fuels interest in Bitcoin as an alternative asset.  Bitcoin has since rebounded 4% to around $55,000, prompting some investors to close short positions. Additionally, the weaker-than-expected US jobs report has reduced the likelihood of aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts, making alternative assets like Bitcoin more appealing. This renewed interest in Bitcoin, driven by whale activity and favorable economic factors, could lead to further price increases. Bitcoin’s Price Could Surge Amid Institutional Confidence and U.S. Election Institutional investors are regaining confidence in Bitcoin (BTC), with many believing the market has bottomed out. QCP Capital analysts note that investors are positioning for long-term gains, particularly focusing on March 2025.  Despite recent volatility and short-term uncertainties, optimism for a market recovery remains strong. The upcoming U.S. presidential election in 2024 could also have a significant impact on Bitcoin’s price. A Donald Trump victory could push BTC to $90,000 due to his perceived support for pro-cryptocurrency policies. In contrast, a win by Kamala Harris may cause a drop to $30,000–$40,000, as her stance on digital assets is less clear, raising regulatory concerns. Key Points:  Institutional investors are targeting 2025 for long-term Bitcoin gains. Bitcoin’s price could surge to $90,000 if Trump wins the 2024 election. Market volatility remains high due to political and economic events.  These factors, combined with institutional optimism, suggest potential for significant Bitcoin price movement. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Daily Technical Outlook – September 9 Bitcoin is currently trading at $55,422, showing a modest gain of 0.28% for the day. However, the cryptocurrency continues to face a challenging technical landscape as it approaches significant resistance near the $55,800 level.  This resistance is marked by a downward trendline that has been extending from recent highs, combined with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $56,198.  Together, these technical levels are exerting pressure on Bitcoin, making it difficult for the asset to break higher. Unless Bitcoin can decisively move above $55,807, the bearish sentiment is likely to persist in the short term.   #Bitcoin Daily Technical Outlook (Sept 9):BTC is trading at $55,422, up 0.28%, but facing strong resistance at $55,800. The 50-day EMA ($56,198) and downward trendline are capping gains. Immediate support at $53,636. Bearish bias persists without a breakout. #BTC #Crypto pic.twitter.com/JCBM4i2Kw6— Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) September 9, 2024  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 51.65, indicating neutral momentum. While the RSI has climbed from oversold conditions earlier this week, it remains unclear whether Bitcoin has enough strength to sustain a rally.  Immediate resistance stands at $55,807, and should Bitcoin manage to break above this level, the next targets lie at $57,277 and $58,491. Failure to clear these key thresholds could result in continued selling pressure.  On the downside, Bitcoin finds immediate support at $53,636. Should the price fall below this level, additional support can be found at $52,570 and $51,222.  If these supports are breached, the market may witness a deeper correction, potentially bringing the price down toward the $50,000 psychological mark. Given the current technical setup, the 50-day EMA and the downward trendline are acting as formidable barriers, preventing Bitcoin from sustaining any upward momentum.  The bearish bias will likely remain unless there is a clear breakout above $55,800.

Bitcoin Magazine,Bipartisan Consensus Emerges on Final Day of America Loves Crypto Tour,"Thu, 19 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/bi-partisan-consensus-emerges-on-final-day-of-america-loves-crypto-tour,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Congressman Wiley Nickel (D-NC) emphasized the need for the United States to decisively lead on crypto policy in a bipartisan manner.","The final event of the America Loves Crypto tour took place yesterday in Washington, D.C. as the country counts down to the 2024 election. Speakers including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, ConSensys CEO Joseph Lubin, and Congressman Wiley Nickel (D-NC) addressed the maximum capacity crowd at the Black Cat music venue. The speakers largely agreed on one idea: the importance of supporting cryptocurrency in America through a concerted bipartisan effort.In their shared stage appearance, Brian Armstrong and Congressman Nickel noted that they see it as critical to keep and foster cryptocurrency innovation in America. This importance, for Nickel in particular, is not so solely founded on a belief in the technology, but is ostensibly due to the fact that 20% of American adults own some form of cryptocurrency, a voting block that Nickel thinks “[has] the ability to sway elections.”Nickel added: “If we want to do things in Washington, it’s critically important that we do it in a bipartisan way. If we politicize the issue with one party going into crypto versus another, it’s going to poison the well in Washington for a decade.”Since Biden took office in 2020, his administration’s SEC, DoJ and DoE (Department of Energy) officials have introduced a fair amount of unwelcome regulatory hurdles. Notably, Nickel’s support of cryptocurrency does signal a change of tune for the historically hostile Democratic Party.“I started coming to DC five years ago, and when I first came here, most people didn’t know what crypto even was,” said Armstrong. “One member of Congress asked me: ‘Isn’t this all some video game or something like that?’ Once they figured out what crypto was over the years, the conversation totally shifted. Now, everybody knows what crypto is, we’re kind of the belle of the ball, the hot topic on everyone’s lips.”However, one attendee, an executive at a prominent financial institution who wished to remain anonymous, reflected on the development of crypto-politicking and what they see as under-commitment on the part of the Democratic Party.In particular, the executive believes that the Biden administration’s veto of legislation overturning SAB 121, which if signed would have allowed highly regulated financial institutions to custody digital assets, was a major wake-up call.They remarked that the crypto industry, despite raising large amounts of money for campaign contributions, still carries a strong stigma and that policymakers don’t offer the respect this single-issue voter bloc deserves.The America Loves Crypto tour had been focused on addressing the stigma with a mixture of live music and grassroots community building. Alex Pall and Drew Taggart, otherwise known as The Chainsmokers, closed out the event, entertaining the crowd with their classic hits, unreleased music, and most notably a cry of “F$*# Gary Gesnler”. The Chainsmokers themselves are no strangers to cryptocurrency and founded the tech and crypto-focused Mantis Venture Capital fund in 2020.With stops in Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C., many in attendance on the America Loves Crypto tour were hopeful that more than 1.4 million Stand With Crypto advocates nationwide can flex their muscle as a true deciding factor in November."
Bitcoin Magazine,Hut 8 and BITMAIN To Launch Next-Generation ASIC Bitcoin Miner with Liquid-to-Chip Cooling,"Thu, 19 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/hut-8-and-bitmain-to-launch-next-generation-asic-bitcoin-miner-with-liquid-to-chip-cooling,"These mining giants join forces to release the U3S21EXPH, a next-generation ASIC miner featuring advanced liquid-to-chip cooling technology.","Hut 8 Corp. (Nasdaq | TSX: HUT), a leading Bitcoin mining company, has expanded its partnership with BITMAIN Technologies Ltd., the world’s largest producer of Bitcoin mining servers, to launch the U3S21EXPH, a next-generation ASIC miner. This model will be the first mass-commercialized miner to feature direct liquid-to-chip (DLC) cooling within a U form factor.Hut 8 plans to deploy the new miner in the second quarter of 2025, with an initial hosting agreement handling approximately 15 exahash per second (EH/s). This hosting deployment, facilitated by custom-built data center infrastructure developed in-house by Hut 8, is a key part of the company’s strategy to expand its computing power across Bitcoin mining and AI compute sectors.“Our partnership with BITMAIN has allowed us to advance our thinking on ASIC compute and create a more scalable model for data center design as we expand our footprint,” said Asher Genoot, CEO of Hut 8. “The U3S21EXPH will be the first miner from BITMAIN broadly commercialized with DLC cooling within a U form factor, making it rack-ready like traditional data center hardware. This innovation bridges critical engineering gaps between Bitcoin mining and AI data center infrastructure in both form factor and cooling technology, and we believe this convergence will enable us to unlock significant synergies and flexibility going forward.”The U3S21EXPH can achieve an efficiency of 13 joules per terahash, producing up to 860 terahash. It uses DLC cooling, a technology traditionally reserved for high-performance computing (HPC) data centers, to make Bitcoin mining more energy efficient and scalable.""Asher and Mike have been invaluable thought partners to BITMAIN since the early days of US Bitcoin Corp, where they demonstrated a unique focus on cost-efficient procurement and operations,” said Irene Gao, Vice President of Mining at BITMAIN. “Hut 8’s technical expertise, operating strength, and track record of innovation made this partnership a natural evolution of our relationship as we began the journey of developing next-generation ASIC technology.”The commercial agreement between Hut 8 and BITMAIN includes a fixed hosting fee and a purchase option for Hut 8 to buy the hosted machines in up to three tranches. This structure allows Hut 8 to assess market conditions before making further investments, minimizing financial risk. If Hut 8 exercises this purchase option, its self-mining capacity could grow from 5.6 EH/s to 20.6 EH/s.   "
Bitcoin Magazine,Celebrating 10 Years of the Hardware Wallet Revolution,"Thu, 19 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/celebrating-10-years-of-the-hardware-wallet-revolution-,A look back at the start of hardware wallets in the Bitcoin space. ,"As we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first hardware wallet, it's remarkable to see how far Bitcoin security has come. From the early days of precarious self-custody methods to the game-changing creation of the Trezor Model One, this revolution has transformed the way we protect our digital assets. With a decade of this experience behind us, it’s worth revisiting the challenges of early Bitcoin self-custody, the pivotal impact of the first hardware wallet, the essential role of self-custody in today's Bitcoin landscape, and the innovative advancements continuing to shape the future of crypto security.The Origin StoryIt all began in 2011 when Marek “Slush” Palatinus logged onto his mining pool server and discovered 3,000 BTC were missing. A mining pool is a collective of miners who combine their computational resources to increase their chances of successfully mining Bitcoin blocks. Slushpool, now known as Braiins Pool, was the pioneering mining pool in the Bitcoin community, established in 2010.This incident highlighted a significant issue: even tech-savvy Bitcoin enthusiasts could fall victim to online attacks. At that time, securing and managing Bitcoin was a daunting task, involving storing private keys on a computer. However, securing information on a computer is difficult; these complex machines are vulnerable to many threats that allow thieves to steal private keys controlling Bitcoin. The hack that cost Palatinus 3,000 BTC was a reminder of these early vulnerabilities.Recognizing a pressing need for a simple, stand-alone device that could securely store Bitcoin, Slush, along with Pavol “Stick” Rusnák, embarked on creating the world’s first hardware wallet. Their vision was to develop an offline computer specifically designed to store Bitcoin securely and make it accessible to non-technical users. The concept was straightforward yet revolutionary: a small, single-purpose device that would keep private keys in an isolated environment, protected from online threats.Before Hardware WalletsBefore hardware wallets became widely available, users had to rely on software wallets installed on computers or smartphones, which exposed them to a range of security threats. Malware infections and other attacks were common. Paper wallets were considered more secure but still required a computer to create the wallet. More secure methods, such as using air-gapped computers for cold storage, required significant technical expertise, and even these methods lacked an adequate level of security for larger amounts of Bitcoin.The usability of early Bitcoin wallets was also a significant issue, with clunky interfaces and complicated backup processes. Many users failed to back up their wallets properly, leading to permanent loss of funds if a device was lost or damaged. Users were frequently unaware of best practices for backups, and the lack of standardized backup methods further increased the risk. A major improvement in backup standardization came with the introduction of Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets with BIP32 in 2012, allowing for easier and more reliable backups. Despite these advancements, there was still a lack of easy and user-friendly options for newcomers. In short, the period before Hardware Wallets was marked by significant security and usability challenges, making Bitcoin self-custody a complex and risky endeavor.The First Hardware WalletIn the years leading up to 2014, various attempts were made to develop simple, single-purpose devices for cryptocurrency storage. However, these efforts failed to gain traction or meet the necessary security standards. Recognizing the need for a robust solution, Slush and Stick monitored the landscape for two years before they finally decided to create their own hardware wallet.In 2014, they released the Trezor Model One. This device was the first ever hardware wallet, combining user-friendly design, truly random private key generation, and the ability to easily sign transactions completely offline. In addition, it implemented the BIP39 standard, a new standard created by the Trezor creators to back up wallets using a list of 24 words representing the private keys, a standard adopted by many wallets and familiar to anyone who has put their Bitcoin in self-custody.When the user first connects the device, it guides them through the setup process to create a new wallet. The device generates a recovery seed, which represents a human-readable version of the wallet’s master private key and enables wallet recovery in case of device malfunction. The user is prompted to write down this list of words on a piece of paper, ensuring the wallet is backed up, and the private keys remain offline.This onboarding process ensures that users create a backup and keep it secure. The user-friendly design offers advanced security, making hardware wallets accessible to both beginners and experienced users.The Open Source AdvantageA key aspect of Bitcoin is its commitment to open-source principles, and that's why the founders of Trezor adhered to the same principles when developing the Trezor Model One. This approach has been adopted by most manufacturers in the industry. Open-source software allows the community to audit and verify a system's integrity. This transparency ensures that potential vulnerabilities can be identified and addressed promptly and allows improvement by the global community. The first hardware wallet was open source, and many in the industry have embraced this approach for transparency, emphasizing the Bitcoin ethos, ""Don't trust; verify.”The Importance of Self-CustodyThroughout Bitcoin's life, we have seen many crypto exchanges and custodians collapse or suffer severe security breaches, showing the importance of holding your private keys. The mantra ""not your keys, not your coins"" emphasizes that relying on third-party institutions means trusting someone else with your assets, which can lead to big problems if the exchange gets hacked, mismanaged, or faces legal issues.The Mt. Gox incident in 2014, one of the earliest and most notable exchange collapses, saw the loss of 850,000 Bitcoins, valued at hundreds of millions of dollars at the time. This catastrophic failure was due to both hacking and mismanagement, leaving users unable to recover their funds. Bitfinex also suffered a significant hack in 2016, resulting in the theft of nearly 120,000 Bitcoins. QuadrigaCX in 2019 saw users losing access to their funds after the sudden death of its founder, who was the only one with the keys to the exchange's wallets. Cryptopia faced a debilitating hack in 2019, and Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, has also experienced breaches and faces increasing regulatory scrutiny. More recently, the FTX collapse in 2022 further reinforced the dangers of entrusting assets to centralized entities. Overall, mismanagement and fraudulent activities led to the loss of billions, impacting countless users and shaking confidence in centralized exchanges.By using hardware wallets, individuals can achieve true financial independence, keeping their digital assets safe from the vulnerabilities of trusted custodians.The Evolving Landscape of Hardware WalletsOver the past decade, the hardware wallet industry has greatly expanded, with many companies offering a variety of products and features to meet different needs. User interfaces now range from simple button-based navigation to touchscreens and full keyboards. Many devices now support multiple cryptocurrencies, while some focus exclusively on Bitcoin. This range of devices caters to both beginners and advanced users, ensuring everyone can find a suitable option.Another advancement has been the inclusion of secure elements—specialized chips designed to protect devices from physical attacks. However, all secure elements currently available on the market are closed-source, which raises transparency concerns. To address this issue, companies like Tropic Square are actively working on developing open-source secure elements to enhance trust and security.Other significant advancements in the industry aim to enhance the security and robustness of wallet backups. Techniques such as Shamir's Secret Sharing, Multisignature Wallets, and SeedXOR allow users to remove single points of failure, making it significantly more difficult for thieves to compromise the wallet. Looking ahead, we can expect more improvements in hardware wallet security and usability. One notable development is the wider implementation of a new enhanced standard, SLIP39, which uses Shamir's Secret Sharing. This method is becoming preferred over the traditional BIP39 standard due to its enhanced security and user-friendliness. With SLIP39, users start with a single list of words to back up their wallet and can later upgrade to a ""sharded"" backup with multiple shares. This approach provides a flexible and highly secure solution, making advanced security measures more accessible and practical for a wider range of users.Looking Forward to the Next DecadeAs we celebrate the first Hardware Wallet, it's clear that this revolution has fundamentally transformed cryptocurrency security. From humble beginnings as a hobby project to becoming a trusted name in the industry, Trezor has pioneered innovations that have empowered countless individuals to take control of their financial future. The journey from the first prototypes to the sophisticated devices that we now use today is a testament to the vision and dedication of the Trezor team.With the continuous evolution of Hardware Wallet functionality and a commitment to security and transparency, the future looks promising. As we look forward to the next decade, the industry remains dedicated to securing and innovating Bitcoin security and usability, ensuring that self-custody becomes increasingly accessible and secure for all.This is a guest post by Josef Tetek.

Bitcoin Magazine,Fractal Bitcoin: A Misleading Affinity,"Wed, 18 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/fractal-bitcoin-a-misleading-affinity,"A quick look at the so-called ""sidechain"" Fractal Bitcoin.","Fractal Bitcoin is a recently launched project that bills itself as “the only native scaling solution completely and instantly compatible with Bitcoin. In essence it is a merge mined system portraying itself as a second layer sidechain for Bitcoin, where multiple levels of “sidechains” can be stacked on top of each other. So think of a sidechain of the mainchain, a sidechain of the sidechain, a sidechain of the sidechain of the sidechain, etc. It is not. Shitcoins Are Not Second LayersFirstly, the entire system is built around a new native token, Fractal Bitcoin, that is issued completely independent of Bitcoin. It even comes with a massive pre-mine of 50% of the supply being split between an “ecosystem treasury”, a pre-sale, advisors, grants for the community, and developers. This is essentially the equivalent of the entire first halving period of Bitcoin when the block subsidy was 50 BTC per block. From here the network jumps to 25 Fractal Bitcoin (FB) per block. Secondly, there is no peg mechanism for moving actual bitcoin into the “sidechain.” Yes, you read that correctly. They are framing themselves as a sidechain/layer two, but there is no actual mechanism to move your bitcoin back and forth between the mainchain and “the sidechain” Fractal Bitcoin. It is a completely independent system with no actual ability to move funds back and forth. One of the core aspects of a sidechain is the ability to peg, or “lock,” your bitcoin from the mainchain and move it into a sidechain system so that you can make use of it there, eventually moving those funds back to the mainchain. Fractal Bitcoin has no such mechanism, and not only that, the discussion around the topic in their “technical litepaper” is completely incoherent. They discuss Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) as a mechanism for “bridging” between different levels of Fractal sidechains. DLCs are not a suitable mechanism for a peg at all. DLCs function by pre-defining where coins will be sent based on a signature from an oracle or a set of oracles expected at a given time. They are used for gambling, financial products such as derivatives, etc. between two parties. DLCs are not designed to allow funds to be sent to any arbitrary place based on the outcome of the contract, they are designed to allocate funds to one of two participants, or proportionally to each participant, based on the outcome of some contract or event that an oracle signs off on. This is not suitable for a sidechain or other system peg, which is ideally architected to allow any current owner of coins in the sidechain or second layer system to freely send coins to any destination they choose so long as they have valid control over them on the other system. So not only is there no functional peg mechanism for the live system, but their hand waving about potential designs for one in their litepaper is just completely incoherent. The whole “design” is a clown show designed to pump bags for pre-mine holders. “Cadence” MiningAnother troubling aspect of the system is its variation on merge mining, Cadence mining. The network utilizes SHA256 as the hashing algorithm, and it does support conventional Namecoin style merge mining. But there is a catch. Only one third of the blocks produced on the network are capable of being produced by Bitcoin miners engaged in merge mining. The other two thirds must be mined conventionally by miners switching their hashrate entirely over to Fractal Bitcoin. This is a poisonous incentive structure. It essentially tries to associate itself with the Bitcoin network calling itself a “merge mined system”, when in reality two thirds of the block production mandates turning hashrate away from securing the Bitcoin network and devoting it exclusively to securing Fractal Bitcoin. Most of the reward is not capturable by miners who continue mining Bitcoin, and the greater the value of FB the greater the incentive for Bitcoin miners to defect and begin mining it instead of bitcoin to increase the share of the FB reward they capture. It essentially functions as an incentive distortion for Bitcoin miners proportional to the value of the overall system. It also offers no advantage in terms of security at all. By forcing this choice it guarantees that most of the network difficulty must remain low enough that whatever small portion of miners find it profitable to defect from Bitcoin to FB can mine blocks at the targeted 30 second block interval. Conventional merge mining would allow the entire mining network to contribute security without having to deal with the opportunity cost of not mining Bitcoin. What’s The Point of This?The ostensible point of the network is to facilitate things like DeFi and Ordinals, that consume large amounts of blockspace, by giving them a system to utilize other than the mainchain. The problem with this logic is the reason those systems are built on the mainchain in the first place is because people value the immutability and security that it provides. Nothing about the architecture of Fractal Bitcoin provides the same security guarantees. Even if they did, there is no functional pegging mechanism at all to facilitate these assets from being interoperable between the mainchain and the Fractal Bitcoin chain. The entire system is a series of handwaves past important technical details to rush something to market that allows insiders to profit off of the pre-mine involved in the launch. No peg mechanism, an incoherent “merge mining” scheme that not only creates a poisonous incentive distortion should it continue rising in value, but actually guarantees a lower level of proof of work security, and a bunch of buzzwords. It does have CAT active, but so do testnets in existence. So even the argument as a testing ground for things built using CAT is just incoherent and a half assed rationalization for a pre-mined token pump. Calling this a sidechain, or a layer of Bitcoin, is beyond ridiculous. It’s a token scheme, pure and simple. "

The move, the first substantial cut in over four years, reflects concerns over the state of the U.S. economy, despite continued reported economic expansion.BREAKING: 🇺🇸 Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by 50 basis points, first cut in over 4 years. pic.twitter.com/xjy0aULKi4— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 18, 2024  According to the Federal Reserve’s official statement, recent economic activity indicators show good growth, but job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has slightly risen. While inflation has made progress toward the Committee's 2% target, it remains somewhat elevated. The rate cut is part of the Fed’s strategy to balance maximum employment with price stability in the face of economic uncertainties.The Fed said that this rate reduction aligns with their commitment to achieving sustainable inflation control while supporting growth in the job market. The Committee will continue monitoring economic developments and adjusting its monetary policy to mitigate risks that could impede its goals. In addition to rate cuts, the Fed will maintain its policy of reducing holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed assets.This decision reflects the Federal Reserve’s approach in navigating a challenging economic landscape, balancing growth and inflation targets while remaining vigilant about potential risks that may emerge in the future. Markets will now look to how this policy shift affects broader financial conditions and future rate decisions.While this rate cut is aimed at supporting economic growth and stabilizing inflation, it could also have positive implications for Bitcoin. Lower interest rates tend to reduce the appeal of traditional assets like bonds and savings accounts, prompting investors to seek alternative investments with higher potential returns in a low-interest-rate environment, like BTC. Historically, rate cuts have contributed to increased liquidity in financial markets, potentially fueling demand for Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio.JUST IN: #Bitcoin hits $61,000 at Fed cuts rates for first time in 4 years 🚀 pic.twitter.com/YympBNbC5E— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 18, 2024  Fed Chair Jerome Powell is slated to speak on this decision in further detail here at 2:30PM EST."

The U.S. exchange aims to rebuild trust after failures like FTX with its new River Proof of Reserves.,"River, a leading U.S. Bitcoin exchange, has launched River Proof of Reserves to provide clients with verifiable proof that their Bitcoin holdings are fully reserved. This sets a new transparency standard for the industry after recent failures of exchanges like FTX shook consumer trust.River CEO Alex Leishman stated, ""River Proof of Reserves is about more than verifying our balances; it's about reinforcing River's commitment to integrity and long-term client trust."" He added, ""Our goal is to build unshakable trust with our clients. Proof of Reserves is the gold standard for Bitcoin custody.""The new feature allows clients to independently confirm that River holds their Bitcoin in full reserve multi-sig cold storage. River currently secures over $800 million worth of Bitcoin for its clients. According to Leishman, ""We're leading by example by proving every month that your Bitcoin is exactly where we say it is."" After recent failures, he encouraged the industry to adopt similar transparency standards to rebuild trust.The added transparency also prevents fractional reserve practices from destabilising fiat currencies and leading to bank failures. If more Bitcoin exchanges prove full reserves, it could restore faith in intermediaries while stopping dangerous leverage in the system."

Bitcoin Magazine,Samourai Developers Appear Together In Court For First Time At Status Conference,"Tue, 17 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/samourai-developers-appear-together-in-court-for-first-time-at-status-conference,"Defense attorneys for Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill continue to argue that the developers didn’t operate a money transmitting business with Samourai, and Rodriguez requests modifications to his bail conditions.","Today, Samourai Wallet developers Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill appeared together in court in the Southern District of New York for a status conference.I attended the status conference for the #Samourai case today on behalf of @BitcoinMagazine.Here’s where things stand: pic.twitter.com/MGVlV6LnJK— Frank Corva (@frankcorva) September 17, 2024  This was the first time the two made a public appearance together since the US Department of Justice (DoJ) charged the two developers with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business in April 2024. It was also the first time either of them have appeared in court since Hill appeared ahead of his bail release in July and Rodriguez first attended a court hearing in May.The prosecution addressed the court first, stating that it had produced “voluminous batches of discovery.”It made the first batch available to the defense in mid-June 2024. This batch featured business records, emails and social media account information amongst other data.The second batch, which it made available to the defense in mid-August 2024, featured data extractions from the devices that the DoJ seized from the two developers. The DoJ has extracted information from 15 of the 44 devices seized from Rodriguez and 25 of the 27 devices seized from Hill.The prosecution also stated that it would produce a third batch of discovery containing a “relatively modest” amount of data soon and that it was prepared to proceed with trial.No Evidence Of Money TransmissionRodriguez’s attorney made the case that it was premature to set a trial date, as the defense has yet to review all of the discovery made available in mid-August 2024. The defense also said that it has yet to come across any evidence showing that Rodriguez or Hill operated an unlicensed money transmitting business.Hill’s attorney stated that they’ve received 8 terabytes worth of discovery. To put this amount of data in context, he explained that this was the equivalent of 75% of the amount of information in the Library of Congress and that, if one printed this information, one could stack the paper it was printed on “to the moon and back 22 times,” making the point that it would be hard to sort through and review.Hill’s attorney also referenced the letter from Senators Cynthia Lummis (R) and Ron Wyden (D) in which the lawmakers stated that the DoJ’s unprecedented interpretation of the US Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) statute regarding operating an unlicensed money transmitting business contradicts the intent of the rule. For this reason, he proposed a motion to dismiss the charge.The judge denied this request and scheduled a follow-up hearing for December 17, 2024 at 10 AM ET.Rodriguez’s Request For Bail ModificationsIn the second portion of the conference, Rodriguez’s lawyer requested two modifications to Rodriguez’s bail conditions. He requested that the court remove Rodriguez's home detention mandate and that the court modify restrictions on Rodriguez’s ability to transact with cryptocurrency, some of which was proceeds from Samourai. (Zack Shapiro, Legal Fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute (BPI) later explained to me that the second modification was requested in part so that Rodriguez could use bitcoin proceeds from Samourai to pay for legal fees.)Rodriguez’s attorney argued that home detention was “unduly restrictive” and “unnecessary,” and that Rodriguez isn’t a flight risk. The defense also cited two instances in which Rodriguez had the opportunity to flee but didn’t in its efforts to make the case that Rodriguez no longer needed to wear a location monitoring device.The prosecution pushed back, arguing that Rodriguez’s home detention was necessary to ensure that Rodriguez continued to appear for trial. It also stated that the charges being levied against Rodriguez for running a “cryptocurrency money laundering business” were severe and that Rodriguez was potentially facing a potential sentence of up to 25 years.The prosecution went on to cite evidence from handwritten pages that it had obtained from Rodriguez’s home containing details about how he would flee the country to a jurisdiction from which it would be difficult to extradite him. This information included a list including different passports as well as having $10,000 in cash, a burner phone, an unused SIM card, and various mnemonic phrases for crypto assets amongst other items.Rodriguez’s lawyer argued that this plan applied to what Rodriguez would do in the case of a more general emergency, while the prosecution argued that this was Rodriguez’s current escape plan.The prosecution stated that it was “a pretty good plan” and that it doesn’t feel that it’s appropriate to stop monitoring Rodriguez at this time. However, the prosecution did say that it would consider allowing Rodriguez certain freedoms if petitioned, without including any specifics.The judge didn’t allow for the modification of the bail conditions and asked both the prosecution and the defense to “get moving on the case.”Donate to the legal defense fund for Rodriguez and Hill via BPI’s P2P Rights Fund."
Bitcoin Magazine,Key Battleground State Pennsylvania Hosts Day Five of the America Loves Crypto Tour,"Tue, 17 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/key-battleground-state-pennsylvania-hosts-day-five-of-the-america-loves-crypto-tour,"Residents of Pennsylvania, a key US swing state in the upcoming US Presidential election, come out in support of a pro-Bitcoin and pro-crypto future for the United States.","On a cool autumn evening in Philadelphia, PA, more than just crypto bros showed up in The City of Brotherly Love to show their support for Bitcoin and crypto on the fifth stop on the America Loves Crypto tour. A diverse crowd of approximately 200, split evenly between men and women, filled Vinyl, a stylish venue in the heart of the city where the event was hosted. The size and enthusiasm of the crowds on this tour has grown considerably as it has rolled on, lending some credence to the notion that the crypto voting block may play a role in swaying major races in US elections come November.The speakers on this tour date included former US Senator and member of Coinbase’s Global Advisory Board Pat Toomey (R); former Congressman Patrick Murphy (D), Kara Calvert, Head of US Policy at Coinbase; Dominic Folino, President of the Pennsylvania Blockchain Coalition; David Johnson, General Council and Strategic Advisor at The Giving Block; Cody Eddings, co-founder and CEO of Snap Refund; and Sam Weinrott, co-founder of PizzaDAO. Electronic pop artist Lauv headlined the event.The theme at the event was that Pennsylvanians, 1.4 million of which are crypto owners, have a big role to play if they want to help move the US in a more pro-crypto direction. Pennsylvania is one of the seven swing states that will likely decide the outcome of the US Presidential election in November, and it’s the one with the most electoral votes: 19. Given that the number of that state’s residents who own crypto is 18 times the vote differential between President Biden and former President Trump in the 2020 Presidential election, it’s imperative that pro-Bitcoin and pro-crypto Pennsylvanians vote, which the speakers at this event made clear.Former Politicians Urge Pro-Crypto Pennsylvanians To VoteAs one of the first speakers at the event, Toomey, a long-term crypto advocate, set the tone for the evening, calling on voters to vote anti-crypto politicians out of office.“My former colleagues have not been able to get legislation across the goal line [and] an out of control Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] is casting a dark shadow over all kinds of crypto development,” began Toomey from the stage.“The growth of this whole sector should be happening in the United States of America. We've got the head start. We've got the tremendous entrepreneurship. We've got the infrastructure. But, increasingly, some of the most talented people in our country are leaving because there are jurisdictions overseas that have provided legal clarity about this,” he added.“There are some folks in Congress on both sides of the aisle that are very in favor of allowing crypto to really develop and thrive. And there are others who are very hostile. My suggestion: some of the hostiles need to lose an election.”Murphy brought a similar energy, as he highlighted the importance of Bitcoin and crypto as well as Pennsylvanians’ role as voters to protect it.“The whole point of crypto is the fact that we don't have to rely on a government or a central bank,” said Murphy, making the point that we can use the technology to control our own destiny.He then seconded Toomey’s call to action regarding voting anti-crypto politicians out of office.“He was absolutely right when he said there's people that are not for us, and we should hold them accountable,” said Murphy.To do so, Murphy hammered home the point that Pennsylvania voters have a key role to play in this election.“There are only really six states that are going to control this election, [and] Pennsylvania [is one with] 19 electoral votes,” said Murphy. “So, we have an incredibly important voice, but only if we use it.”Founders Ask For Clear Crypto RulesFollowing the talks from Toomey and Murphy was a founders panel featuring Johnson, Folino, Eddings and Weinrott.Much like what was discussed on a panel on the first stop on the tour, the founders present asked for little more than clear rules of the road for crypto from the US regulatory apparatus.“Being compliant in crypto right now in the US is incredibly hard because, as much as you want to follow the rules, it’s not always clear what the rules are,” said Johnson. “Too many folks in Washington either don’t understand the technology, don’t care to understand it, or, in many cases, unfortunately, are hostile to it. The reality is innovators are gonna innovate, whether it’s here or somewhere else,” he added.  Founders share their thoughts on crypto regulation in the US.  “We know that crypto is the future of payments, and the reason we’re out here supporting this is that we want that to happen in the US, not elsewhere.”Folino chimed in, sharing his thoughts on the roadblocks preventing the crypto industry from flourishing in the US.“Politicians, regulation and one Senator whose name we all know I think is a real big reason why we’re not moving forward,” said Folino, presumably referring to Senator Elizabeth Warren, head of the anti-crypto army. “Everyone has to get out and vote; everyone has to continue to educate everyone they can.”Folino is no stranger to educating others, including policymakers in Pennsylvania, about Bitcoin and crypto. Through his work at the Pennsylvania Blockchain Coalition, he frequently speaks with state-level politicians.“Folks absolutely want to get it,” Folino told Bitcoin Magazine about the elected officials and bureaucrats who he educates in Pennsylvania.“We've got a lot of more open-minded members in the PA State House. And I think they're getting it in the Senate, as well,” he added, before sharing that crypto will be a pivotal issue in upcoming PA elections in both this election cycle and even more so in the future.A Sophisticated Voter BaseCalvert echoed Folino’s sentiment that crypto would continue to become a bigger voting issue as time goes on. She’s also been pleasantly surprised by not only how many have raised their voices to make crypto an issue in this election cycle, but by how sharp those who have spoken up and come out to the America Loves Crypto tour events are.“It's a really sophisticated crowd,” said Calvert of the tour’s attendees. “I expected more people who were just coming out for the artists, and what I've discovered is it's people who really, really care deeply about crypto.”Calvert also commented on the fact that those in attendance are not only educated when it comes to crypto but are active voters, as well.“In Detroit I asked the question ‘How many people know where their polling place is?’” said Calvert, before mimicking the majority of the crowd’s reaction by shooting her own hand into the air.“I was blown away. So, it's not just the sophistication of them as crypto owners, [but] their sophistication as voters. In Milwaukee, same thing. And here, same thing. I've been stunned by how sophisticated they are,” she added.In part because of what she’s seen on the tour, Calvert believes that the Bitcoin and crypto industry will find a home in the US.“America is going to win,” said Calvert.“You can't prevent innovation from happening. You can make it a lot harder. You can create barriers. But ultimately, I think innovation wins out,” she added, before noting that the new, powerful crypto voting block has to get out and vote in November to help expedite this process — especially in a state like Pennsylvania.The final date of the America Loves Crypto tour is scheduled for Wednesday, September 18, at The Black Cat in Washington, DC and will feature a performance by The Chainsmokers.

Bitcoin Magazine,REGULATING BITCOIN AND CRYPTO IN NIGERIA: CROSSROADS BETWEEN CAPITAL CONTROL AND FINANCIAL FREEDOM,"Tue, 17 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/regulating-bitcoin-and-crypto-in-nigeria-crossroads-between-capital-control-and-financial-freedom,A call for sensible and measured Bitcoin regulation by the Nigerian government.,"The ascent of Bitcoin and digital assets has sparked a classic battle, with governments acting as vigilant hawks, trying to control a technology that is as nimble and elusive as a gazelle darting across the savanna of decentralization. In Nigeria, this conflict is as tangled as dense jungle foliage, where regulators strive to enforce their rules on a system meant to evade conventional constraints, while individuals continue to pursue the elusive prize of financial freedom just out of grasp. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has oscillated between hardline approaches and cautious acceptance, exemplified by its 2021 directive banning banks from facilitating Bitcoin transactions. Yet, just a few years later, the same CBN approved the launch of a Naira-backed stablecoin, signaling a growing recognition of the inevitable role digital currencies will play in the future of finance. However, these regulations, rather than protecting Nigerians, have often undermined the rights of citizens to freely participate in the financial revolution that Bitcoin offers. This culminated in a recent court case brought by James Otudor, an ardent Bitcoin advocate, who has sued the Nigerian government, seeking to establish the fundamental right of citizens to trade and own Bitcoin and USDt. The case shines a spotlight on the larger issue of human rights being trampled upon in the name of regulatory oversight. It’s not just about financial innovation, it's about ensuring that Nigerians are not excluded from the benefits of a global economy increasingly driven by decentralized technologies.  “The Chronology of Cryptocurrency Regulation In Nigeria” SOURCE :- Templars Law  Across Africa, the regulatory landscape for Bitcoin and digital assets is shaped by two competing paradigms: collaboration and confrontation. Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken some steps toward a collaborative model, as seen in the launch of its Regulatory Incubation Program aimed at fostering innovation while maintaining oversight. Yet, even within this supposedly progressive framework, the right of Nigerians to freely own and transact in Bitcoin remains under threat. Recent actions, such as the freezing of assets linked to the Bybit and KuCoin exchanges, illustrate how deeply entrenched government control remains. In other African nations, such as Ghana and Kenya, similar dynamics are playing out, with governments hesitating to fully embrace decentralized currencies, despite clear public demand. The Nigerian SEC's approval of two cryptocurrency exchanges in 2024 represents a positive step, but this piecemeal approach fails to address the larger issue of financial sovereignty for Nigerians. South Africa has taken a slightly more balanced route, regulating Bitcoin and digital assets as financial assets while allowing for greater integration into the traditional financial ecosystem. Nevertheless, these approaches, while varied, all point to the same fundamental issue: the lack of a clear framework that respects the unique nature of Bitcoin and its potential to transform economies and empower citizens.As Nigerian regulators grapple with how to manage this burgeoning industry, they must recognize that Bitcoin's regulatory landscape cannot be lumped together with the entire digital assets ecosystem. Bitcoin operates on fundamentally different principles, with decentralization at its core, unlike many other digital assets that may still rely on centralized control or governance. Any attempt to impose blanket regulations on all digital assets, including Bitcoin, would be a catastrophic misstep, one that risks stifling innovation and depriving Nigerians of the opportunity to fully participate in the global economy. Regulators must, therefore, approach Bitcoin with a unique understanding of its intrinsic operational metrics. Its decentralized nature is not a flaw to be regulated out of existence but a feature that offers unprecedented opportunities for financial inclusion and economic freedom. Policymakers should learn from global examples, such as Europe’s MiCA framework, but adapt those lessons to the specific context of Bitcoin, ensuring that they do not impose unnecessarily restrictive regulations. The failure to distinguish Bitcoin from other digital assets in the regulatory process would result in inefficiency, stifle innovation, and risk pushing legitimate activities into the shadows. James Otudor’s court case stands as a pivotal moment, not just for Nigeria but for the entire continent, as it seeks to ensure that financial regulations are crafted with a respect for human rights and an understanding of the transformative power of decentralized finance.  “The Global Crypto Adoption Index Score” SOURCE :- Chainalysis  The way forward for Nigeria is clear: regulators must craft policies that protect citizens while encouraging innovation, and they must do so with the understanding that Bitcoin is fundamentally different from other digital assets. The current regulatory push, if not carefully balanced, risks becoming a tool of oppression rather than empowerment. By engaging with the Bitcoin community and developing a nuanced approach to regulation, Nigeria can position itself as a leader in the global financial revolution. Anything less would be a disservice to the millions of Nigerians who have already embraced this new paradigm and a betrayal of the ideals of freedom and innovation that Bitcoin represents.This is a guest post by Heritage Falodun.

Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin’s Future in Payments: Overcoming Stablecoin Dominance with Fiatless Fiat  ,"Tue, 17 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-future-in-payments-overcoming-stablecoin-dominance-with-fiatless-fiat,Bitcoin stable channels supported by the Lightning Network could introduce a novel peer-to-peer payment infrastructure to rival stablecoins,"Stablecoins have so far dominated the crypto payment market, but some Bitcoin developers believe there's a proposal out there that could offer a legitimate alternative. Seven years ago, Dorier, a long-time developer, set out to democratize bitcoin payment processing by launching a free and open-source alternative to the then-dominant BitPay: BTCPay Server. Today, despite the project's strong grassroots success among Bitcoin enthusiasts and online merchants, the landscape of cryptocurrency payments has evolved dramatically from when Dorier first began his journey. The rise of stablecoins has quickly dominated the space, pushing bitcoin—the world’s largest digital asset—to the sidelines in the payment processing arena.Fueled by growing demand for stable currency options, particularly US dollars, stablecoins have swiftly taken over the cryptocurrency payments market. This surge has left many Bitcoin enthusiasts struggling to cope with the reality that these dollar-pegged assets could reinforce the very system Bitcoin was designed to challenge—the hegemony of the US dollar. As stablecoins continue to gain traction, Bitcoin promoters find themselves at a crossroads, questioning how to preserve Bitcoin’s vision of financial sovereignty in a market increasingly leaning toward stability over decentralization.A new proposal emerging from the Lightning ecosystem has caught Dorier’s attention, and the veteran developer believes it could address this obstacle. Speaking to a packed audience at BTCPay Server’s recent annual community gathering in Riga, Dorier introduced the concept of ""fiatless fiat""—a Bitcoin-native alternative to treasury-backed stablecoins like Tether and USDC.Synthetic USD Back in 2015, BitMEX co-founder and then-CEO Arthur Hayes outlined in a blog post how to use futures contracts to create synthetic US dollars. Although this idea never gained widespread traction, it became a popular strategy among traders seeking to hedge against bitcoin's volatility without having to sell their underlying bitcoin positions.For readers less familiar with financial derivatives, a synthetic dollar (or synthetic position) can be created by two parties entering a contract to speculate on the price movement of an underlying asset—in this case, bitcoin. Essentially, by taking an opposite position to their bitcoin holdings in a futures contract, traders can protect themselves from price swings without having to sell their bitcoin or rely on a US dollar instrument. More recently, services like Blink Wallet have adopted this concept through the Stablesats protocol. Stablesats allows users to peg a portion of their bitcoin balance to a fiat currency, such as the US dollar, without converting it into traditional currency. In this model, the wallet operator acts as a ""dealer"" by hedging the user’s pegged balance using futures contracts on centralized exchanges. The operator then tracks the respective liabilities, ensuring that the user's pegged balance maintains its value relative to the chosen currency. (More detailed information about the mechanism can be found on the Stablesats website.)Obviously, this setup comes with a significant trade-off. By using Stablesats or similar services, users effectively relinquish custody of their funds to the wallet operator. The operator must then manage the hedging process and maintain the necessary contracts to preserve the synthetic peg.Stable channels and virtual balancesIn Riga, Dorier pointed out that a similar effect can be achieved between two parties using a different type of contract: Lightning channels. The idea follows recent work from Bitcoin developer Tony Klaus on a mechanism called stable channels. Instead of relying on centralized exchanges, stable channels connect users seeking to hedge their Bitcoin exposure with 'stability providers' over the Lightning network. A stable channel essentially functions as a shared Bitcoin balance, where funds are allocated according to the desired exposure of the 'stability receiver.' Leveraging Lightning’s rapid settlement capabilities, the balance can be continuously adjusted in response to price fluctuations, with sats shifting to either side of the channel as needed to maintain the agreed distribution.Here’s a simple chart to illustrate what the fund's breakdown may look like over time:  credit: Tony Klaus  Clearly, this strategy entails considerable risks. As illustrated above, stability providers taking leveraged long positions on the exchange are exposed to large downside price volatility. Moreover, once the reserves of these stability providers are exhausted, users aiming to lock in their dollar-denominated value will no longer be able to absorb further price declines. While those types of rapid drawdowns are increasingly rare, Bitcoin’s volatility is always unpredictable and it’s conceivable that stability providers may look to hedge their risks in different ways. On the other hand, the structure of this construct allows participants' exposure within the channel to be linked to any asset. Provided both parties independently agree on a price, this can facilitate the creation of virtual balances on Lightning, enabling users to gain synthetic exposure to a variety of traditional portfolio instruments, such as stocks and commodities, assuming these assets maintain sufficient liquidity. Researcher Dan Robinson originally proposed an elaborated version of this idea under the name Rainbow Network. The good, the bad, the uglyThe concept of “fiatless fiat” and stable channels is compelling because of its simplicity. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that rely on complex and unsustainable economic models involving exogenous assets, the Bitcoin Dollar, as envisioned by Dorier and others, is purely the result of a voluntary, self-custodial agreement between two parties.This distinction is critical. Stablecoins usually involve a centralized governing body overseeing a global network, while a stable channel is a localized arrangement where risk is contained to the participants involved. Interestingly, it does not even have to rely on network effects: one user can choose to receive USD-equivalent payments from another, and subsequently shift the stability contract to a different provider at their discretion. Stability provision has the potential to become a staple service from various Lightning Service Provider types of entities competing and offering different rates.This focus on local interactions helps mitigate systemic risk and fosters an environment more conducive to innovation, echoing the original end-to-end principles of the internet.The protocol allows for a range of implementations and use cases, tailored to different user groups, while both stability providers and receivers maintain full control over their underlying bitcoin. No third party—not even an oracle—can confiscate a user’s funds. Although some existing stablecoins offer a degree of self-custody, they by contrast remain vulnerable to censorship, with operators able to blacklist addresses and effectively render associated funds worthless.Unfortunately, this approach also inherits several challenges and limitations inherent to self-custodial systems. Building on Lightning and payment channels introduces online requirements, which have been cited as barriers to the widespread adoption of these technologies. Because stable channels monitor price fluctuations through regular and frequent settlements, any party going offline can disrupt the maintenance of the peg, leading to potential instability. In an article further detailing his thoughts on the idea, Dorier entertains various potential solutions to a party going offline, mainly insisting that re-establishing the peg of funds already allocated to a channel “is a cheap operation.” Another potentially viable solution to the complex management of the peg involves the creation of ecash mints, which would issue stable notes to users and handle the channel relation with the stability provider. This approach already has real-world implementations and could see more rapid adoption due to its superior user experience. The obvious tradeoff is that custodial risks are reintroduced into a system designed to eliminate them. Still, proponents of ecash argue that its strong privacy and censorship-resistant properties make it a vastly superior alternative to popular stablecoins, which are prone to surveillance and control.Beyond this, the complexity of the Lightning protocol and the inherent security challenges posed by keeping funds at risk in ""hot"" channels will need careful consideration when scaling operations.Perhaps the most pressing challenge for this technology is the dynamic nature of the peg, which may attract noncooperative actors seeking to exploit short-term, erratic price movements. Referred to as the “free-option problem,” a malicious participant could cease honoring the peg, leaving their counterparties exposed to volatility and the burden of reestablishing a peg with another provider. In a post on the developer-focused Delving Bitcoin forum, stable channel developer Tony Klaus outlines several strategies to mitigate this issue, offering potential safeguards against these types of opportunistic behaviors.While no silver bullet exists, the emergence of a market for stability providers could potentially foster reputable counterparties whose long-term business interests will outweigh the short-term gains of defrauding users. As competition increases, these providers will have strong incentives to maintain trust and reliability, creating a more robust and dependable ecosystem for users seeking stability in their transactions.Concluding his presentation in Riga, Dorier acknowledged the novelty of this experiment but encouraged attendees to also consider its enticing potential. ""It's very far-fetched, it's a new idea. It's a new type of money. You need new business models. You need new protocols and new infrastructure. It's something more long-term, more forward-looking.""Users and developers interested to learn or contribute to the technology can find more information on the website or through the public Telegram channel."

Bitcoin Magazine,The Financial Anarchist Manifesto,"Mon, 16 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/the-financial-anarchist-manifesto,"Using technologies like Nostr and Chaumian ecash, the Financial Anarchist challenges the status quo, aiming to reclaim economic sovereignty and disrupt centralized financial power through Bitcoin.","This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine's ""The Privacy Issue"". Subscribe to receive your copy.""Anarchy is order; government is civil war."" - BellegarrigueThe advent of decentralized money gave rise to an intriguing cognitive bias among early adopters. Bitcoin's success is convincing many that we can do away with trusted institutions altogether—that trust itself can be engineered away. This hubris is reflected in how we deploy our collective resources and capital. In the absence of appropriate social structures, we have become risk averse and generally mistrusting of each other. As a result, Bitcoin commerce has become marginalized and many revolutionaries have retreated into techno-utopianism. This complacency has deprived many of the tools needed to navigate this digital economy. Between regulated platforms and half-baked scaling solutions, there is little room for alternatives.The situation is bleak: the majority of Bitcoin’s commercial activity still revolves around fiat interfaces. Inertia has left users vulnerable to highly organized state actors. While our technical elite fantasizes about theoretical constructs, progress around practical solutions has stalled. Instead of stimulating market functions to replace current financial institutions, we have allowed them to further entrench their position, passively accepting their authority.This pattern is all too familiar in revolutionary movements—once wealth has been seized or obtained, ideals often become lazy.Fortunately, the convergence of two technologies—one old and one new—holds the potential to challenge the status quo. Chaumian ecash, decades in the making, and Nostr, a novel, decentralized, social network could provide the groundwork necessary for emergent behavior to trump central planning. The Financial Anarchist seeks to harness this potential and challenge the incumbent system with decentralized alternatives. He embraces the risk entailed by this duty because he believes it is right and just. He believes we can embrace and wield trust rather than reject it outrightFor the Financial Anarchist, decentralization is not an end in itself, but a means to empower individuals and cultivate genuine economic freedom.A public forumLike Bitcoin, Nostr does not attempt to prescribe what its users make of it; rather, it offers a set of rules for individuals to organize around and create a foundation for markets to emerge. Those rules are based on a fundamental set of principles: censorship resistance and decentralization.It achieves this using distributed servers called relays. Relays host content published by users, and thanks to encryption, cannot discriminate based on the nature of the content. Each user event is signed by his cryptographic key and Nostr ensures it remains always available by distributing data across multiple relays. Of course, users are also encouraged to run their own relays. To interact with this network of servers, participants use a variety of software clients that can verify the authenticity of messages shared by others.Those features and many more make Nostr a strong contender to become the identity layer for the online arena. Every individual is represented by a unique identifier tied to a public key. The motivation is to eliminate the concept of accounts usually associated with centralized platforms. The arrival of Nostr heralds a new era of market prosperity, enabling individuals to liberate themselves from the serfdom of the consumer internet. Identity is finally freed from its fiat chains.Thanks to its versatility, the protocol lends itself to an ever-growing number of use cases. Chief among them is the creation of social networks for us to coordinate around local and global marketplaces. An interesting trend in this direction is the integration of Nostr with Bitcoin payment applications. Using the protocol to communicate between Bitcoin services, we can enable interoperability so that our social graphs can be ported to any supported application. Our network becomes an extension of our Nostr public key, allowing us to maintain our financial relationships across platforms.The Financial Anarchist imagines Nostr as the foundation of a new Serene Republic, the ultimate theater for trade and industry in the digital world. It is here that we begin the process of individuation anew.Reputation marketsToday's reputation systems are entangled with fiat institutions, with public information about trade and commerce siloed into centralized databases. An open and distributed record of trust is a significant step towards a legal system more closely resembling natural laws. Based on cryptographic attestations of social connections, a functional Web-of-Trust can align users' incentives and allow markets to thrive by significantly reducing the costs typically associated with enforcing fiat contracts and laws. Though this may seem implausible, informal systems like Hawala already rely on trust and reputation to operate. Based on a global network of informal brokers, nearly half a trillion dollars move through these channels every year. Built on centuries of accumulated trust and relationships, Hawala examplifies the potential and resilience of self-regulating economies. (citation needed) Nostr introduces a radical shift in our approach to reputation as it promises to replace centralized certificate authorities with local and distributed trust archives. Relational databases can now be unique to every individual, informed by their voluntary interactions with other market participants. Using simple discovery features, we can reduce information asymmetry and practically eliminate barriers to entry. Individuals new to Nostr only need a single trusted connection to reveal an entire social graph based on their peer’s connections. Imagine the “recommended” feature of the average digital platform but open and extended to every facet of the market based on your social network.Nostr gives us the tools to survey the integrity of counterparties and accurately assess your position against them in the economy. It is now possible to establish trust structures outside the purview of traditional internet platforms.Economist Hernando De Soto has attested to the quality of societal records as a defining characteristic of modern societies. Keeping accurate records of assets and transactions is crucial to economic prosperity. Nostr allows us to take an unprecedented leap forward in this regard. We can finally seize information and our data back from the fiat overlords. The goal is not to eliminate institutions or middlemen but to democratize the provision of such services — preferring systems based on social accountability over centralized institutions and their monopoly on violence.Electronic cashWhile Bitcoin makes several tradeoffs to achieve global trust, the decentralization of finance should not be seen as an end in itself. Unfortunately, this misconception has gained popularity over the years, leading to inevitable conflicts of interest and moral hazards.A compelling alternative is to recognize and embrace the inherently local nature of finance. Finance operates locally, while money functions globally. Attempting to decentralize finance as if it were money is an exercise in futility.Chaumian ecash offers a different approach. For the uninitiated, ecash is a medium of payment made possible by the use of blinded servers. Using any form of collateral, the server can issue a corresponding number of tradeable notes. By design, Chaumian mints cannot identify individual payments, payers, or payees. Notes can be transmitted over any communication layer and do not rely on third parties for settlement. The Lightning network allows every Chaumian mint to settle with one another, allowing local finance to operate at a global scale. Despite its remarkable features, ecash has often been dismissed by casual observers due to its custodial model. However, this perspective overlooks its true potential. By distributing risk across smaller, local instances, we can address the systemic issues typically associated with custodians. Payments are inherently social, making intermediated finance a natural fit for many transactions. The Financial Anarchist dreams of a future where every Bitcoin wallet has access to the modern equivalent of a neighborhood bank. By leveraging their Nostr social graph, users will be able to quickly identify trusted payment hubs within their network. In doing so, ecash protocols will redefine banking and payment services. We can reduce finance to its smallest common denominators, reversing decades of centralization caused by fiat cronyism.Using Nostr as a coordination mechanism, we can empower communities to pool common resources and establish dedicated financial hubs. Individuals can interface with the Lightning network by sharing channels and liquidity, providing cost-effective payments for every participant. Any group of users can now collaborate to optimize their interactions with the Bitcoin network. As a result, the convenience and user experience associated with custodial wallets are no longer exclusive to large institutions.Because of the protocol’s versatility, onboarding other users becomes trivial. Ecash notes can be issued for every payment request and used by the recipient to pay any Lightning invoice. Atomic payments allow it to piggyback off any wallet on the network without the application developer changing a single line of code. Users can accumulate notes from different issuers or swap them into their preferred mint. Alternatively, distinct notes can be used to fund a single multi-party payment, affording users incredible freedom and optionality. Members of certain communities may begin accepting a collection of different notes depending on their relative social proximity to the issuers. Mints could be distributed such that multiple operators could issue tokens, effectively distributing the risk of user exposure to a single operator. This free flow of payment will snowball in different ways. First, a new class of dedicated users will emerge, advertising their services through various marketplaces. One area of particular interest is the provision of stable ecash notes. Thanks to its native programmability, it’s possible to issue dollar-denominated ecash backed by Bitcoin reserves. This could have significant implications for the Bitcoin economy. Using the asset as collateral presents many opportunities to extend its market demand beyond its current speculative use cases. This could result in a flywheel effect which provides the necessary liquidity for it to stabilize over time and become a more reliable medium of exchange. Until then, the unique properties of ecash make it a superior option for payment applications which could see it challenging the current treasury-backed stablecoin hegemony. The operation of stablecoin mints also creates compelling incentives for liquidity providers. By issuing dollar-denominated notes, they can establish non-custodial long exposure to Bitcoin and take directional bets on the asset. The distributed and permissionless nature of ecash operations presents an interesting contrast to the centralization of current stablecoin issuers, offering market actors a way to hedge their risks against single points of failure.The grassroots adoption of this technology will undoubtedly face challenges, akin to the early days of Bitcoin and Lightning. While hobbyists and amateurs play a crucial role in bootstrapping ecash, creating a robust and reliable financial system at scale will involve growing pains. Opportunists may exploit others' trust, and the custodial aspect of mints makes them particularly susceptible to scams and fraud.However, safeguards can be implemented to mitigate these risks. One idea being explored is programmatic redemption, which would require issuers to regularly prove their solvency. Users would periodically “rotate” the notes in their wallets, exchanging them for new ones. Some have referred to the idea as “scheduled bank runs”. The technical details could be abstracted away to ensure a seamless experience. Additionally, various “Proof-of-Liability” systems are being developed to mitigate the risks of fractional reserves.As a general rule, it is wise to avoid holding more in ecash mints than one can afford to lose.ConclusionWe have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear. - A Declaration of the Independence of CyberspaceIn an age where centralized authorities dictate the rules of financial engagement, the Financial Anarchist emerges with a radical proposition: to support an alternative system reliant on trust between individuals.This is not a call for civil disobedience. It is also not an attempt to undermine the valiant work of developers focusing on trust-minimized technologies. It is the proclamation of the undeniable potential within our grasp as individuals to organize and use technology to elevate our communities. The spirit of voluntary association at the heart of Bitcoin should drive us to focus our efforts on maximizing market optionality. Sadly, the paternalistic approach borne out of techno-utopianism has failed at this mission and left us stuck within the constraints of traditional financial institutions.The Financial Anarchist envisions a world where Nostr and Chaumian ecash allow us to reclaim this sovereignty. By opening up the design space for experimentation and locally-driven initiatives, we are making a conscious effort to divorce from the centralized command structure we’ve inherited. The vision of autonomy and self-regulation alluded to by those tools reinforces the notion that individuals should be free to define their economic relationships on their own terms.We must build new autonomous zones across cyberspace, away and out of reach from the “weary giants of flesh and steel” Perry Barlow warned us about. The current state of distrust in our ranks is not the natural order of things; it is the consequence of generations of imposed authority. It is no surprise that today nobody even trusts their neighbor. Should Bitcoin prevail, we expect this trend to reverse course and eventually foster levels of trust among individuals previously deemed unimaginable. Anything less would be a tragic outcome."
Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin and Crypto Voters Make Their Voices Heard at America Loves Crypto Stop in Wisconsin,"Mon, 16 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/bitcoin-and-crypto-voters-make-their-voices-heard-at-america-loves-crypto-stop-in-wisconsin,Wisconsin is ready to move past partisanship with the unifying force of Bitcoin and crypto ahead of the 2024 election.,"On the heels of tour stops in Arizona, Nevada and Detroit, the America Loves Crypto tour rolled into Wisconsin on Friday, September 13, where local Bitcoin and crypto voters in the state rallied in support of pro-crypto candidates for the upcoming US elections. At the Red Rock Saloon in Milwaukee, WI, more than 200 people — including founders, politicians and technology enthusiasts — congregated to ask the question: How can we support Bitcoin and crypto on Capitol Hill?The battleground state was split nearly down the middle in the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, with Biden and Trump receiving 1,630,866 and 1,610,184 votes, respectively. With 840,000 Wisconsinites owning some form of cryptocurrency, the narrow 2020 electoral margin of just 20,000 votes could easily be disrupted by the undecided crypto vote in 2024.The America Loves Crypto crowd was met with politicians from both sides of the aisle as well as Bitcoin and crypto industry representatives, followed by up-and-coming artist Jessie Murph, whose soulful blend of country and pop music resonated with a surprising number of fans.The event's speakers included Josh Schoemann, Washington County Executive (R); Peter Burgelis, City of Milwaukee Alderman (D); Kara Calvert, Coinbase Head of U.S. Policy; Dom Bei, founder of Proof of Workforce; Spencer Smith, Founder of AmpliPhi Digital; Tiara Nicole, Co-founder of Craft the Future; Ian McCullough, Stand With Crypto WI chapter president and Awen co-founder; and Maggie Schmidt, Awen co-founder.Wisconsin State Pension’s Bitcoin InvestmentIn May of this year, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) invested $162 million dollars in Bitcoin ETFs, becoming the first U.S. state pension fund to invest in the asset class.“The Wisconsin retirement system is a very healthy fund, and it’s funded at almost 100%. Very few pensions in the U.S. can boast that, and they are the 10th largest pension in the nation,” Dom Bei told Bitcoin Magazine.“They have a good balance of being both conservative and innovative. It’s a huge deal because they are healthy and they are looked at nationwide as a leader in the space,” he added.Bei is a firefighter for the city of Santa Monica, California and Founder of the Bitcoin 501(c)(4) non-profit Proof of Workforce Foundation who educates workers, unions, pensions and municipalities with education-based Bitcoin adoption. To Bei, the trend of pensions investing in Bitcoin will only continue to gain momentum.“The $5 billion dollar Houston Firefighters Relief and Pension Fund was actually the first public pension fund to buy Bitcoin back in 2021,” Bei explained. “The state of Michigan has also made a small $7 million allocation to Bitcoin ETFs. It will be fascinating to see the profile of the pensions that follow, whether they are underwater and mismanaged, or fully funded and operating from a place of strength,” he added.For Bei, Bitcoin is not just a tool for risk managers and Wall Street-types seeking outperformance, but an opportunity to re-engineer the American city for the benefit of wage earners, not just those in power.“It’s not just necessarily about municipalities holding bitcoin”, said Bei. “It’s really about activating the Bitcoin community, its innovation, and competing to bring in Bitcoin companies while increasing financial literacy for everyone.”“If union members and workers learn the history of Bitcoin and why it was created, they are going to understand immediately where Bitcoin fits into the union story and the genesis of organized labor,” said Bei. “Bitcoin was created as a response to the financial system placing its failures on the backs of the wage earner.”Bei’s non-profit has partnered with the City of Santa Monica to launch the Santa Monica Bitcoin Office, akin to the El Salvador Bitcoin Office, to launch a Peer to Pier Bitcoin Festival in October of this year during Los Angeles Tech Week.When it comes to other investment allocators taking the plunge with Bitcoin and crypto, Spencer Smith, founder of marketing firm AmpliPhi Digital and Board Member of the Wisconsin Technology Council, sees Wisconsin’s allocation as an extremely important signal to the investment community.“If I’m an investment manager reporting to a committee, you can point to the state of Wisconsin and say ‘Well, they did it, here’s how they did it, and why I propose that we [allocate to Bitcoin].’ said Smith. “Having that first-mover advantage is important for Wisconsin, [and] it really sets the stage for the rest of the states as well.”Smith also noted that Bitcoin’s sideways price action, following the meteoric 2021 bull run, has led to more clear conversations amongst Wisconsin legislators as well.“Now that the hype has died down, it gives us a lot more room to educate on a basis that’s more from an understanding [of] ‘How do we figure this out? Now that there’s ETFs, how do we deploy these? How do you explain compliance?’” he said.Incentives first. Party second.Wisconsin has seen a stark divide between its rural and urban voter populations, reflecting a larger national trend of partisan polarization with rural voters predominantly voting Republican and urban voters predominantly voting Democrat. Despite that backdrop, the Red Rock Saloon saw a unique blend of poly-partisanship on display, where Republicans, Democrats and even Independents saw value in courting the crypto voter.Delivering remarks in the typically deep blue Milwaukee, Joe Schoemann (R), Executive of the rural Washington county, received loud cheers in response to his re-affirmation of crypto as a means of prosperity for the average American.“I’ve been focused on giving the American Dream to the American citizen,” said Schoemann to the crowd. “Crypto represents that for all of us.”It’s no secret that the Bitcoin and crypto industry has seen what many view as unwarranted, or at least unwelcome, attacks from the national regulatory apparatus in the last few years, and because of this, the industry is not backing down.This attitude was echoed by Peter Burgelis (D), City of Milwaukee Alderman.“I ran for office because the election didn’t go my way and I was pissed,” said Alderman to the crowd “And when something doesn’t go your way, you can post something dumb on social media or you can put your boots on and run. And I ran and I won,” he added. “Crypto is important and your vote matters. Get out and vote.”U.S. Senate candidate Phil Anderson (I) reflected on the fact that Bitcoin and crypto appear to be one of the few issues that can transcend party lines.  “We don’t have representative government anymore,” Anderson told Bitcoin Magazine.“Lobbyists write the bills and the two-party system makes the representatives vote a certain way. And that goes to what all of Congress will agree to: constantly spending on war, constantly spending without any responsibility and really abusing fiat money,” he added.“It’s all tied together, and it’s important to support Bitcoin and blockchain as a way of making our government more transparent and more accountable.”With his campaign slogan of #DisruptTheCorruption, Anderson sees Bitcoin and crypto as both a technological and electoral priority for representative democracy.The next America Loves Crypto event is in Philadelphia, PA on September 16, followed by a 600-person event in Washington, D.C., culminating in a featured performance by The Chainsmokers to close out the tour.Attendees may RSVP for the free events via the Stand With Crypto website."

Bitcoin Magazine,The Urgent Need for Bitcoin Tax Reform to Encourage Everyday Use,"Mon, 16 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/the-urgent-need-for-bitcoin-tax-reform-to-encourage-everyday-use,An argument for why tax treatment of bitcoin is a massive disincentive for its use in commerce. ,"The debt based monetary system has become quite extreme. On one hand, the US crossed the $35 trillion national debt milestone, placing a $104k burden on every US citizen. On the other hand, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) puts federal expenditures for 2024 at 24.2% of GDP.This divergence between profligate spending and debt ballooning puts the economy on a narrow path. It is exceedingly unlikely that USG would opt to reduce spending, most of which goes to social programs, entitlements and the military. The latter alone is the key ingredient that backs USD as world currency.Conversely, this entails another Fed balance sheet expansion, with three 0.25% rate cuts this year already priced in. In turn, non-currency assets like equities, gold and Bitcoin are poised for growth yet again. At the root of this dynamic is the question of information validity.Just as the US Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to revise down job figures by up to one million between April 2023 and March 2024, the information corruption is visible with central banking itself. If the Federal Reserve can increase M2 money supply by 27% in 2020-21, the money itself loses informational coherence.It is this why investors then seek equities, gold and Bitcoin. These assets become vehicles of value because currency loses its ability to reliably relay value. The problem is, they are also taxed as a way to subdue the velocity of exiting the central banking system.This is especially pertinent for Bitcoin, a unique asset that is both a store of value but could be made as a daily transaction driver. The question then poses itself, is a legalistic landscape viable in which low-value Bitcoin transactions are exempt from federal taxation?Bitcoin’s Usage and Currency Substitution SuitabilityTo understand the regulatory path forward, we first need to understand how Bitcoin is typically used. After all, contrasting Bitcoin usage against fiat usage paints a clearer picture if Bitcoin can be used as a practical currency, or if it will be perceived as a threat to the current monetary system.Notwithstanding layer 2 scaling solutions such as Lightning Network, the more BTC is used the greater is the load on the Bitcoin mainnet as miners process transaction blocks. In turn, greater network activity generates greater friction, manifesting as escalating fees for each BTC transaction. In a developed country like Australia, cryptocurrency usage for payments has been typically minimal.    Image credit: Reserve Bank of AustraliaThis is predictable as people need strong incentives to move away from existing payment solutions, ones that are already instantaneous and convenient.At best, BTC transactions mostly revolve around third-parties facilitating BTC transactions using fiat currency. Case in point, Bitcoin onramp platform Strike had to ditch Prime Trust custodian as it eventually filed for bankruptcy. However, Strike still uses banks such as Lead, Cross River Bank, and Customers Bank.In other words, Bitcoin adoption is attached to online payment systems, through commercial banks which are tied to central banks. The latter have already made money de facto digital, except it is hosted on their ledgers.Although these institutions can tamper with the money supply, they can do so to facilitate maximum liquidity needed for a debt-based monetary system in which fiat currency is effectively a debt-tracker.In contrast, Bitcoin’s scarcity makes it less appealing for such use. Gold already showcased this when it was abandoned. Because gold’s supply was not flexible enough to support a growing (debt-based) economy, mainstream economists viewed the gold-backed currency as outdated. Moreover, Bitcoin is ill-suited as a daily currency driver against feeless alternatives like Nano (XNO) that boast eco-friendly green hosting or potential CBDCs. Rather, Bitcoin’s strength relies on inviolable scarcity, one that serves as a global reserve settlement layer. While both of these factors, network friction and flexible liquidity, are making Bitcoin less suitable as a proper medium of exchange, it also makes Bitcoin less threatening to the system. But does that mean that Bitcoin’s tax treatment should be tweaked?The Impact of Current Tax Policies on Bitcoin UsageOn exchanges and platforms like aforementioned Strike, users can freely buy Bitcoin without worrying it will be a taxable event. It only becomes so when BTC is sold for profit. Then, it is subject to capital gains tax for trading. That’s because the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) designates Bitcoin as property. If Bitcoin is held less than a year before it is sold, holders are subject to ordinary income tax rate ranging from 10% to 37%.Holding Bitcoin over one year makes it subject to 0% - 20% tax rate, depending on the income level spread across three brackets - 0%, 15% and 20%. In turn, Bitcoin holders have to keep a track of when they bought BTC, at which price, and when they sold it, at which price. The profit difference is taxed as capital gains.Likewise, swapping Bitcoin for another cryptocurrency is a taxable event, subject to capital gains tax. If BTC is received as payment/earnings, or from mining/staking/airdrops, it is then treated as wages income tax, falling into the 10% - 37% ordinary income tax range. Alongside buying BTC, holding it or donating it to a registered non-profit, users can also transfer bitcoins from exchanges to wallets without constituting taxable events. Although BTC gifts can also pass as non-taxable upon reception, they would still be subject to the same tax regime later.In the case of selling Bitcoin at a loss, holders could write it off, limited to $3,000 per year (carriable into next year if exceeded). At the moment, it is still possible to engage in Bitcoin tax-loss harvesting, in which holders can sell BTC at a loss to claim the tax break, and then buy it back. Unfortunately, this leeway not enjoyed by shareholders could be terminated with the proposed Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act, under Section 1091, “Loss from wash sales of specified assets”.But even with that tax break still open, it is clear that Bitcoin’s unique nature is not reflected in IRS treatment. The tracking alone of every BTC transaction severely discourages daily use as the mere purchase of a pint of beer would require calculating initial BTC price to see whether it was at a loss or at a gain.Likewise, merchants would have to hassle with the same tax regime because they technically received property, not money. Combined with the previously mentioned issues of friction and flexible liquidity, this puts an additional burden on mass Bitcoin adoption by incentivizing long-term holding.Moreover, Bitcoin’s expansion into innovative financial products is impeded as well.The Tax Burden on Bitcoin DerivativesAlthough Bitcoin has become the least volatile cryptocurrency due to its large $1.2 trillion market cap, holders would still prefer to protect themselves against price fluctuations. Derivatives, such as options and futures, make this possible.Additionally, Bitcoin’s price volatility creates opportunities for traders willing to bet if BTC price will go up (going long) or down (going short). This speculative market important for risk hedging and price discovery is also burdened by the current tax regime.Once an options contract is exercised, or when it expires, it is subject to capital gains tax. Most traders will create trading alerts to signal the moment BTC price crosses a certain threshold. This helps traders to respond quickly as the loss or capital gain tax is calculated based on the difference between Bitcoin’s fair market value and the strike price. So, staying consistently updated on Bitcoin’s fair market value is a challenge.Additional difficulty would be to calculate the fair market of another cryptocurrency if it was the vehicle for Bitcoin contract settlement.But if the contract expires without buying BTC, the capital loss would be regarded as the paid premium for the contract. On the other end of the equation, sellers of Bitcoin options premiums would have to pay capital gains tax as well. When it comes to futures contracts, 60% of gains/losses are taxed as long-term capital gains/losses, while 40% are taxed as short term capital gains/losses. This is irrespective of futures contract length.While derivatives markets greatly enhance liquidity and trading volume, the current Bitcoin tax regime discourages broader participation.The Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act and BitcoinThe year 2024 turned into a massive pileup of good news for Bitcoin, barely bothered by the German government’s BTC selloffs. The most recognizable cryptocurrency received an institutional blessing when the Securities and Commissions Exchange (SEC) approved 11 exchange-traded funds (ETFs), having climbed to $48.13 billion AuM as of August 20th.Not only did Bitcoin ETFs exceed all expectations, but their success served as an endorsement ramp for two presidential candidates, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former President Donald Trump. Both endorsed the idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve at the Nashville Bitcoin 2024 conference at the end of July.Just at that time, senators Ted Budd (R-NC), Krysten Sinema (I-AZ), Cynthia Lummis ( R-WY) and Kirsten Gilibrand (D-NY) re-introduced bill S.4808, the Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act.As the bill’s title implies, cryptocurrencies would receive the same tax treatment that is currently reserved for foreign currencies. Meaning, under the value of $200, cryptocurrency transactions would only be subject to regular sales tax. Although this is still behind El Salvador’s approach of having Bitcoin as legal tender, the bill would immediately lift the barrier for small item purchases in merchant locations.Previously, one of the co-sponsors, Sen. Cynthia Lummis, noted she is “absolutely certain that Bitcoin will be among them…and perhaps dominant among them”, referring to a future world order based on a basket of global reserve currencies.As of the latest campaign development, presidential candidate Kamala Harris is in favor of President Biden’s 44.6% capital gains tax, in addition to raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. The Broader Implications for Bitcoin AdoptionAlthough to a lesser extent, recession is still on the table moving into 2025. If materialized, this will be another BTC price test, if its risk-off status will be light or heavy. But on the long-term horizon, the structure of mass democracy doesn’t allow for austerity.And if austerity is not on the horizon, the ballooning of the Fed’s balance sheet is, inevitably eroding USD confidence. It is anyone’s guess if factions vying for power will allow Bitcoin to become a potential exit vehicle on that road.Making BTC transactions under $200 subject to sales tax, instead of capital gains tax, would go a long way in further ingraining Bitcoin into the financial system. Considering that Blackrock’s IBIT has become the largest Bitcoin ETF, at $17.24B AuM, it is fair to say that Bitcoin’s “threat” perception has been muted, if not abandoned.ConclusionCurrently priced at above $60k per BTC, it is becoming increasingly clear that only a tiny micro minority will ever own more than 1 BTC. Accordingly, such a small population pool is unlikely to shake the proverbial central banking boat.What is more likely to form is a parallel, hybrid system in which Bitcoin is both a commodity and a premium currency that is tracked. This is evidenced by the fact that even senators not explicitly anti-crypto want expansive cryptocurrency surveillance.And Bitcoin’s transparent ledger is ideally suited for it. This is a positive development as privacy-oriented cryptocurrencies like Monero (XMR) have already been ousted from the largest exchange onramps. Without those headwinds when sailing on a fiat ocean, Bitcoin is free to foster greater financial inclusivity and innovation despite the onramp/offramp barriers, including taxing an appreciating asset. The Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act is paving the road, but it is likely to receive more tweaks. Specifically, it is yet not clear how transactions amounting to $200 are aggregated. This is a guest post by Shane Neagle.

Bitcoin Magazine,Mi Primer Bitcoin Promotes Two Staff Members to Leadership Roles,"Mon, 16 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/mi-primer-bitcoin-promotes-two-staff-members-to-leadership-roles,The open-source Bitcoin education platform founded in El Salvador moves two members of its in-house talent — one a native Salvadoran — into supervisory positions.,"In the wake of Mi Primer Bitcoin’s three-year anniversary, the El Salvador-based organization announced that it has promoted two of its staff members — Reyna Chicas and Quentin Ehrenmann — to leadership positions.Chicas, a native Salvadoran who has been with the organization for approximately two years, has quickly ascended through its ranks from teacher to Lead Teacher to a member of the Board of Directors to now the Director of Education. She has shined since the beginning of her time with Mi Primer Bitcoin (MPB), when the organization sent her to Bitcoin Lake in Guatemala for six months to teach in the community. During this past year, she’s been a point person for Mi Primer Bitcoin for its communications with El Salvador’s Ministry of Education.  Reyna Chicas speaks at Adoption Bitcoin El Salvador in 2023. Photo credit: Frank Corva  “As a Salvadoran who began this journey as a teacher, I’ve experienced firsthand the power of education to inspire growth and change,” said Chicas in MPB’s announcement.“With this new opportunity as Director of Education, my commitment is stronger than ever to help create more stories of empowerment with MPB, to be a good example for my people, both in my country and beyond, and to show that with passion, effort, and dedication, we can build a better future,” she added.Ehrenmann has also been a rising star since joining MPB in 2023 and was recently promoted to General Manager of the organization. For his first project for MPB, he moved to an underdeveloped island off the eastern coast of El Salvador and kickstarted an education-focused circular economy. After that, he moved to the mountains of Berlin, El Salvador to educate within the community there. He was then promoted to Director of Operations, where he helped further MPB’s Node Network of Independent Educators, which now includes teachers in 27 countries.“From working on a special project on an island off El Salvador to joining the leadership team and contributing to the execution of our mission, my journey at Mi Primer Bitcoin has been incredibly rewarding,” said Quentin in MPB’s announcement. “I look forward to helping bring independent Bitcoin education to the next 100,000 students.”For more on Mi Primer Bitcoin, read our Founders profile on the organization’s founder, John Dennehy."
Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Mining Shutdown Cause 20% Surge in Electricity Bills,"Mon, 16 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-shutdown-cause-20-surge-in-electricity-bills,The shutdown of a Bitcoin mining facility in Norway caused a 20% increase in electricity bills for the town's residents. The loss of the mining operation's revenue forced the local power company to raise rates to offset costs.,"The closure of a Bitcoin mining facility in the Norwegian town of Hadsel has led to a 20% increase in electricity bills for residents. The mine was shut down after the municipality declined to renew its permit due to noise complaints.Kryptovault operated the mining facility for 20% of local power company Noranett's revenue. With the loss of its largest customer, Noranett is raising prices for households to compensate.Locals had complained for years about noise from the mine's cooling fans. However, due to the closure, residents are now faced with paying several hundred dollars more per year for electricity.""When such a large individual customer switches off overnight, it has an impact,"" said a Noranett manager. The company estimates bills could rise by up to $300 monthly.While unhappy about the price hikes, Hadsel's mayor said the municipality must deal with the consequences of losing a major power consumer under the regulations. He said the town will now seek new projects to utilize the excess energy capacity.The situation highlights how Bitcoin mining can help reduce electricity costs by distributing grid expenses to a larger customer base. Bitcoin mine's continued operation would have prevented the rate spike for citizens.The incident has fueled debate in Norway about imposing restrictions on energy-intensive mining. This could force miners to relocate operations abroad and can further lead to an increase in prices for residents. "
Bitcoin Magazine,Detroit Aims to Drive Digital Asset Innovation on Day Three of the America Loves Crypto Tour,"Fri, 13 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/detroit-aims-to-drive-digital-asset-innovation-on-day-three-of-the-america-loves-crypto-tour,"The Motor City and State of Michigan see opportunity in creating a business-friendly environment for the Bitcoin and crypto industry, welcoming the Stand With Crypto Alliance.","Crypto-natives and fans of Detroit rapper Big Sean flocked to the Lager House, just outside of downtown Detroit, for the third stop of the America Loves Crypto Tour. The event provided both an evening of live entertainment and a call to action to get out the crypto vote in the upcoming 2024 elections following previous stops in Arizona and Nevada.Michigan is considered a battleground state, and the Stand With Crypto Alliance sees the state’s 940,000 bi-partisan Bitcoin and crypto owners — 25,000 of which are Stand With Crypto members — as potentially crucial for the upcoming presidential election. The 2020 election’s margin within Michigan was only about 156,000 voters, which means that crypto voters could well swing the electoral outcomes in 2024.Local startup founders, university blockchain clubs, former State Representative Ryan Berman (R) and operatives of the Stand With Crypto Alliance took the stage for the third stop on the battleground state roadshow to communicate a simple message: Digital asset owners and entrepreneurs have leverage, and it’s time to make their political voices heard.The last few years have seen the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) inconsistent regulatory actions have a chilling effect on the industry. Adam Zientarski, co-founder of Detroit Ledger Technologies, remarked that he would like to see that change so that “startups can actually be focused on growth and not on moving the company to another country”. On behalf of entrepreneurs in the state, he simply asks regulators to “let them build.”In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, former Michigan State representative and Attorney General candidate Ryan Berman echoed similar thoughts on the role of regulation.“You can’t predict what is going to happen in this technology space, but we want to make sure people can innovate and have the tools necessary without government blocking them,” Berrman said. “Detroit has been on a rebound over the last couple of decades. It would be beneficial and put Michigan on the map to say ‘Hey, we want to welcome these types of companies, we want innovation.’”Berrman went on to emphasize the economic importance of fostering innovation in the state:“Here, at this event, we’ve heard from these entrepreneurs from the University of Michigan, [which] has half of their student body from out of state. The other half is in-state kids from our big schools – currently, our students leave the state looking for jobs. What can we do to keep our students here? Technology is at the forefront.Crypto Education: Not Just For Elected OfficialsTechnological innovation took the driver’s seat during the America Loves Crypto’s stop in The Motor City, and what stuck out was the cultural interest in Bitcoin and crypto co-mingled with the pride many Detroiters, in particular college students, have for their state of residence. President of the University of Michigan Blockchain Club Evan Solomon received raucous applause from the crowd when shouting out his alma mater.College students and educational institutions, a particular point of pride for Michigan, seem to be paying strong attention to Bitcoin and crypto during this election season. Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Solomon proudly shared that his on-campus club has received support from the prestigious Ross School of Business to host an event with 25 visiting organizations in attendance.Yet, Solomon also remarked that clear regulation is “the single most important thing” when it comes to fostering talent and strengthening the industry in the state. When students consider what careers or companies to pursue post-college, the stigma of over-regulation is a major factor. But the tides are turning and Solmon is optimistic following a 2023 meeting with U.S. Senator Gary Peters (D), saying: “I thought the reception was great, they wanted to hear us out, and they wanted to hear about the applications.”Code And Law: Constitutional Battles for DevelopersBitcoin and crypto are in the State of Michigan not just a matter of revenue and economic development, but of important constitutional considerations for more than 940,000 Michigan crypto owners.Berman, who has a background in law, explained that overlapping First, Second and Fourth Amendment considerations have informed his perspective on crypto. Specifically, he argued that 3D printing files for creating firearms are as much a Second Amendment constitutional right as they are issues of free speech and privacy, and he sees overlap with cryptocurrency in that regard now that developers of open source privacy tools are also being prosecuted.“Freedom of speech is what our Founding Fathers were all about. Publishing a manual can be bad if somebody uses it for a bad purpose, but [in the case of 3D-printed guns] there’s plenty of legitimate purposes as well. But even if there aren’t any, it doesn’t matter what the purpose is, it’s all about freedom, it’s all about the First Amendment. I’m totally an advocate for not only the Second and First Amendments, but the Fourth Amendment in particular when you’re talking about encrypted communications.”America Loves Crypto continues its road show this week and the following in Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Washington D.C. Attendees can RSVP for these free events where they will be able to register to vote while connecting with like-minded folks ahead of election day this November."

Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Price Action: What to Expect Next ,"Fri, 13 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-price-action-what-to-expect-next,"Bitcoin’s Path Forward: Insights into Price Targets, Support, and Resistance Zones ","Bitcoin's recent price movements have caused concern among investors about what might come next. However, by looking at key indicators such as the 200-week moving average, Pi Cycle Top Indicator, and the Golden Ratio Multiplier, we can gain insights into potential support and resistance levels for Bitcoin.Leaning Bearish?In recent weeks, Bitcoin's price has fluctuated, dipping as low as $53,000 before stabilizing in the middle of our newly formed $50,000 to $60,000 range. If this bearish price action is to continue and price breaks to lower lows the 200-week moving average heatmap (blue line), a historically critical support level, is currently close to $39,000 but fast approaching $40,000 (white line). This round psychological level also aligns with the Bitcoin Investor Tool (green line), which has also converged with the 200-week moving average, could serve as potential downside targets.  Figure 1: Converging levels of support at $40,000 if bearish price action continues.  Nearby TargetsAbove current price there are several important levels closer to the current price that investors need to keep an eye on. The Pi Cycle Top Indicator (upper orange line) suggests a crucial resistance level around $62,000, based on the 111-day moving average. The Golden Ratio Multiplier (lower orange line) indicates that the 350-day moving average, currently around $53,000, has been a solid level of support during this market cycle, especially as this is close to the technical $52,000 support and significant psychological support of $50,000.  Figure 2: Nearby support between $53,000 and $50,000, with immediate resistance between $60,000 and $62,000.  More Chop?In the short term, Bitcoin could very well continue ranging between the low $50,000 region and the $60,000 resistance, similar to the range we had formed between $70,000 and $60,000 that led to fairly stagnant price action for a majority of 2024. Despite recent downturns, Bitcoin's long-term outlook is still promising. In the past, Bitcoin has experienced similar periods of fluctuating prices before eventually reaching new highs. However, this process can take some time, potentially weeks or even months, before a sustainable trend reversal occurs following periods of low volatility.  Figure 3: Monthly volatility is rapidly decreasing, potentially as BTC finds a new range between $50,000 and $60,000. View Live Chart 🔍  ConclusionFor long-term investors, it's important to remain calm and not be swayed by day-to-day price changes. Over-trading often leads to poor decisions and losses, and the key is to stick to a strategy, whether it involves accumulating at support levels or taking profits at resistance.Bitcoin's recent price action has not been ideal, but with some simple technical analysis and a clear understanding of support and resistance levels, investors can prepare and react rather than over overreact to natural market fluctuations.For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out our recent YouTube video here: Bitcoin Price Action: What to Expect Next"

However, Kendrick notes that new all-time highs (ATHs) for Bitcoin are likely no matter who wins the election, with Bitcoin still expected to hit $75,000 if Vice President Kamala Harris secures the presidency.JUST IN: A Trump victory could send #Bitcoin to $125,000, but new ATHs are likely no matter who wins election, says Standard Chartered bank 🚀 pic.twitter.com/SfGoRSyKwn— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 12, 2024  In the new report, Kendrick explained that while the outcome of the election will impact the Bitcoin industry, the risks of a Harris presidency may be overstated. “BTC will end 2024 at fresh all-time highs under either election outcome – [circa] $125,000 level under Trump or c.$75,000 level under Harris,” Kendrick wrote. While a Harris win could initially result in a price decline, he emphasized that ""dips would be bought as the market recognizes that progress on the regulatory front will still be forthcoming.""Despite concerns within the industry that Harris may adopt a more hostile stance toward Bitcoin, Kendrick believes that her administration would be ""much less negative"" for digital assets than a second Biden administration. Furthermore, Standard Chartered maintains its bullish outlook, forecasting that Bitcoin will hit $200,000 by the end of 2025, regardless of who wins this year’s election.The 2024 election has drawn attention to the differing approaches to Bitcoin regulation by the two candidates. Trump has become an ally to the Bitcoin industry, speaking at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville this summer, where he expressed support for Bitcoin. The Republican National Committee has also included Bitcoin in its platform, pledging to defend the right to mine Bitcoin and protect self-custody.In contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris has remained silent on the issue, opting not to attend the Bitcoin conference. The Democratic Party’s platform makes no mention of Bitcoin or cryptocurrency, which has led to concerns within the industry about the potential regulatory environment under a Harris administration. Although Harris has not publicly shown hostility to crypto, some fear a continuation of the stricter regulatory policies seen during President Joe Biden’s term, notably shaped by figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren and SEC Chair Gary Gensler."
Bitcoin Magazine,Revolutionizing Bitcoin Mining: The Power of Three-Phase Systems,"Thu, 12 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/revolutionizing-bitcoin-mining-the-power-of-three-phase-systems,Why Three-Phase electrical systems can offer a competitive advantage to miners with ASIC efficiency gains tapering off.,"Bitcoin mining has seen exponential growth since the first ASIC miner was shipped in 2013, improving hardware efficiency from 1,200 J/TH to just 15 J/TH. While these advancements were driven by better chip technology, we're now reaching the limits of silicon-based semiconductors. As further efficiency gains plateau, the focus must shift to optimizing other aspects of mining operations—particularly the power setup.Three-phase power has emerged as a superior alternative to single-phase power in bitcoin mining. With more ASICs being designed for three-phase voltage input, future mining infrastructure should consider adopting a uniform 480v three-phase system, especially given its abundance and scalability across North America.Understanding Single-Phase and Three-Phase PowerTo comprehend the significance of three-phase power in bitcoin mining, it's essential first to understand the basics of single-phase and three-phase power systems.Single-phase power is the most common type of power supply used in residential settings. It consists of two wires: one live wire and one neutral wire. The voltage in a single-phase system oscillates sinusoidally, providing power that reaches a peak and then drops to zero twice during each cycle. Imagine you are pushing a person on a swing. With each push, the swing moves forward and then comes back, reaching a peak height and then descending back to the lowest point before you push again. Just like the swing, a single-phase power system has periods of maximum and zero power delivery. This can lead to inefficiencies, especially when consistent power is required, although this inefficiency is negligible in residential applications. However, it becomes significant in high-demand, industrial-scale operations like bitcoin mining.Three-phase power, on the other hand, is commonly used in industrial and commercial settings. It consists of three live wires, providing a more constant and reliable power flow. In the same swing analogy, imagine you have three people pushing the swing, but each person is pushing at different intervals. One person pushes the swing just as it starts to slow down from the first push, another pushes it a third of the way through the cycle, and the third person pushes it two-thirds of the way through. The result is a swing that moves much more smoothly and consistently because it’s being pushed continuously from different angles, maintaining a constant motion.Similarly, a three-phase power system ensures a constant and balanced power flow, resulting in higher efficiency and reliability, particularly beneficial for high-demand applications like bitcoin mining.The Evolution of Bitcoin Mining Power RequirementsBitcoin mining has come a long way since its inception, with significant changes in power requirements over the years. Before 2013, miners relied on CPUs and GPUs to mine bitcoins. The real game-changer came with the development of ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) miners as the bitcoin network grew and competition increased. These devices are specifically designed for the purpose of mining bitcoins, offering unparalleled efficiency and performance. However, the increased power requirements of these machines necessitated advancements in power supply systems.In 2016, a top-of-the-line miner was capable of computing 13 TH/s with a power consumption of approximately 1,300 watts (W). While considered highly inefficient by today’s standards, mining with this rig was profitable due to the low network competition at that time. However, to generate meaningful profits in today’s competitive landscape, institutional miners now rely on rigs that demand around 3,510 W.The limitations of single-phase power systems has come to the fore as the power requirements of ASIC and the efficiency demands of high-performance mining operations grows. The transition to three-phase power became a logical step to support the growing energy needs of the industry.   480v Three-Phase in Bitcoin MiningEfficiency First480v three-phase power has long been the standard in industrial settings across North America, South America, and other regions. This widespread adoption is due to its numerous benefits in terms of efficiency, cost savings, and scalability. The consistency and reliability of 480v three-phase power make it ideal for operations that demand greater operational uptime and fleet efficiency, especially in a post-halving world.One of the primary benefits of three-phase power is its ability to deliver higher power density, which reduces energy losses and ensures that mining equipment operates at optimal performance levels. Additionally, implementing a three-phase power system can lead to significant savings in electrical infrastructure costs. Fewer transformers, smaller wiring, and reduced need for voltage stabilization equipment contribute to lower installation and maintenance expenses.For example, a load requiring 17.3 kilowatts of power at 208v three-phase would need a current of 48 amps. However, if the same load is supplied by a 480v source, the current requirement drops to just 24 amps. This halving of the current not only reduces power loss but also minimizes the need for thicker, more expensive wiring​​.ScalabilityAs mining operations expand, the ability to easily add more capacity without major overhauls to the power infrastructure is crucial. The high availability of systems and components designed for 480v three-phase power makes it easier for miners to scale their operations efficiently​​. As the bitcoin mining industry evolves, there is a clear trend towards the development of more three-phase compliant ASICs. Designing mining facilities with a 480v three-phase configuration not only addresses current inefficiencies but also future-proofs the infrastructure. This allows miners to seamlessly integrate newer technologies that are likely to be designed with three-phase power compatibility in mind​​. As shown in the table below, the immersion-cooling and hydro-cooling techniques are superior methods in scaling up bitcoin mining operations in terms of reaching higher hashrate output. But to support such a much higher computation capacity, the configuration of three-phase power becomes necessary for maintaining a similar level of power efficiency. In short, this will lead to a higher operational profit with the same profit margin percentage.    Implementing Three-Phase Power in Bitcoin Mining OperationsTransitioning to a three-phase power system requires careful planning and execution. Here are the key steps involved in implementing three-phase power in bitcoin mining operations.Assessing Power RequirementsThe first step in implementing a three-phase power system is to assess the power requirements of the mining operation. This involves calculating the total power consumption of all mining equipment and determining the appropriate capacity for the power system.Upgrading Electrical InfrastructureUpgrading the electrical infrastructure to support a three-phase power system may involve installing new transformers, wiring, and circuit breakers. It's essential to work with qualified electrical engineers to ensure that the installation meets safety and regulatory standards.Configuring ASIC Miners for Three-Phase PowerMany modern ASIC miners are designed to operate on three-phase power. However, older models may require modifications or the use of power conversion equipment. Configuring the miners to run on three-phase power is a critical step in maximizing efficiency.Implementing Redundancy and Backup SystemsTo ensure uninterrupted mining operations, it's essential to implement redundancy and backup systems. This includes installing backup generators, uninterruptible power supplies, and redundant power circuits to protect against power outages and equipment failures.Monitoring and MaintenanceOnce the three-phase power system is operational, continuous monitoring and maintenance are crucial to ensure optimal performance. Regular inspections, load balancing, and proactive maintenance can help identify and address potential issues before they impact operations.ConclusionThe future of bitcoin mining lies in the efficient utilization of power resources. As advancements in chip processing technologies reach their limits, focusing on power setup becomes increasingly critical. Three-phase power, particularly a 480v system, offers numerous advantages that can revolutionize bitcoin mining operations.By providing higher power density, improved efficiency, reduced infrastructure costs, and scalability, three-phase power systems can support the growing demands of the mining industry. Implementing such a system requires careful planning and execution, but the benefits far outweigh the challenges.As the bitcoin mining industry continues to evolve, embracing three-phase power can pave the way for more sustainable and profitable operations. With the right infrastructure in place, miners can harness the full potential of their equipment and stay ahead in the competitive world of bitcoin mining.This is a guest post by Christian Lucas, Strategy at Bitdeer.

Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Vaults and the Future of Bitcoin Custody,"Wed, 11 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-vaults-and-the-future-of-bitcoin-custody,"As Bitcoin grows in value and popularity, custody solutions become more critical. Learn about Bitcoin vaults and their importance in the custody space.","Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, has come a long way from its informal past. From an experimental digital currency that occupied cypherpunk niches on the internet, it has grown to a trillion-dollar market cap asset valued at over $66,900 per coin as of this writing.While investing in Bitcoin is still considered a wild ride, the asset is quickly maturing. Financial institutions are closing in and creating hybrid vehicles to invest in cryptocurrency. The ecosystem reached a new milestone with the advent of Bitcoin ETFs, making people realize the immensity of Bitcoin’s potential in traditional markets and spurring new demand.As more people and institutions invest in Bitcoin, Bitcoin vaults become more crucial. Here, we examine the features and importance of Bitcoin vaults and how they contribute to ensuring a reliable infrastructure that promotes sustained value and investability. We explore their role in professionalized and institutional custody. Secure custodians are vital to protecting digital assets from theft and loss. This article also tracks the fast-advancing technology of Bitcoin vaults and how it relates to future developments in the custody space.What are Bitcoin vaults, and how do they work?Bitcoin vaults are offline digital asset storage solutions offering enhanced protection against online threats. This protection is created through multiple security layers.As the Bitcoin investment sphere grows, new products are being created. Bitcoin vaults are a critical component of these new financial products. While hot wallets and exchange accounts offer easy transaction access, they are vulnerable to hacks.Bitcoin vaults are fortified digital safes. They protect your Bitcoin by taking it offline and shielding it from the constant openness to online attacks. Their multiple layers of security include withdrawal delays, multi-signature or multisig authentication, and cold storage solutions.One highly secure approach to Bitcoin or crypto vaults is called air-gapping. Air-gapped storage offers robust protection against malware attacks, phishing scams, and unauthorized access. Many Bitcoin vaults integrate advanced encryption techniques. They typically require multiple authorizations for transactions to proceed. Advanced encryption and the need for layered authorization steps bolster security posture. As a Bitcoin investor, ensuring that your coins are kept in air-gapped and layered security vaults protects your investment and helps you hold it long-term.Vaults: Vital Components of Bitcoin CustodyBitcoin vaults are a component of Bitcoin custody solutions. Bitcoin custody is the entire process of holding and securing BTC. Because Bitcoin is a digital asset, it requires unique storage solutions to protect it from theft and loss. As BTC’s value rises, so does the interest from cybercriminals and hackers. Therefore, secure custody solutions are essential for protecting these digital assets.The Advanced Technology Behind Bitcoin VaultsThe following advanced technologies combine to create the security behind Bitcoin vaults. Understanding them helps you understand, evaluate, and appreciate their robustness. Cold StorageCold storage is a security method that keeps Bitcoin offline or away from internet-connected devices. Being offline reduces the risk of cyberattacks. Bitcoin cold storage is often used with multi-sig technology to provide maximum security.Multi-Signature TechnologyMulti-signature or multisig technology requires multiple private keys to authorize a Bitcoin transaction. This method implies that even as one key is compromised, the Bitcoin in the wallet cannot be transferred. The transaction still requires the other keys to be approved. Multisig technology enhances security by distributing ownership and control over Bitcoin. It makes it very challenging for a single entity to access or steal the assets.Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) are tamper-resistant and hardened devices that secure cryptographic processes. They generate, protect, and manage keys used for data encryption and decryption, as well as digital certificates and signatures.These specialized devices, in other words, are designed to protect and manage your digital keys. They provide a secure environment for cryptographic key generation, storage, and usage, ensuring that the private keys are never exposed to potential threats. HSMs are often used in Bitcoin vaults to enhance the security of the stored assets.HSMs are recommended for those with significant BTC holdings. They are also ideal for businesses handling Bitcoin and other crypto. While integration can be complex and require continued maintenance, the security benefits far outweigh the cost for those with high-value holdings.Furthermore, HSMS are tested, validated, and certified to the highest standards. They enable organizations to meet and exceed emerging and established regulatory requirements for cybersecurity.Companies Offering BTC Custody SolutionsAs Bitcoin and its related financial products gain popularity, so does the need for reliable custody. Companies that offer this service are called Bitcoin or crypto custodians and are a critical component of the digital asset industry. These companies or platforms offer secure BTC and crypto storage and provide services such as private key management, online security solutions, and transaction processing.Crypto custodians are gaining prominence as the cryptocurrency market grows. They are essential in ensuring that assets are stored and managed securely. Moreover, they protect investors' funds by providing layers of security beyond what public wallets or exchanges offer. However, it must be noted that exchanges, trading desks, and investment platforms run their own custody solutions. In addition, some exchanges are also the most noted custody providers. Examples of top custody providers, most of which offer investment access, include Swan Bitcoin, BitGo, Coinbase Custody, Anchorage, Gemini Custody, Bakkt, and Bitcoin Suisse. How To Choose Among BTC Custody ProvidersSeveral companies are competing in the crypto custody market. If you are a regular BTC trader or investor, you might be curious about how to choose what works for you.  Photo by Traxer on Unsplash  Platforms should enable users to buy and store Bitcoin easily. While popular exchanges like Binance and Kraken offer a wide range of services, including retail buying and selling of crypto, they have downsides. They may not provide the best storage options for your crypto, and they may be more vulnerable and open to various hacks.Long-term BTC investors usually shun day trading and prefer the buy-and-hold strategy. Swan Bitcoin is a low-fee platform specializing in BTC-specific investments. It offers a full suite of BTC financial services, including Swan Vault, simplifying BTC storage for users. If you're curious how it compares to large global exchanges, check out the Kraken review on Swan Bitcoin’s site. The best Bitcoin vaults give you complete control over your coins, with user-friendly and straightforward features for setup, deposits, and withdrawals. They use the most reliable hardware to provide users with the most robust security. An example of such hardware is the Blockstream Jade signing device, a hardware wallet used by Swan Bitcoin to ensure BTC owners' full access to keys offline. You need signing devices that store two private keys to unlock a Swan Vault. Swan manages a third key called the Cloud Key, which is recommended for use as a second key to prevent bringing both hardware signing devices to the same location. Bitcoin vaults must have sound recovery strategies for BTC theft or loss, as 72-hour holds for Cloud Key withdrawals. Moreover, these vaults need to offer comprehensive support services, including secure storage of spare keys to assist you in moving funds and customer support manned by trained specialists. When Investing in BTC, Choose a Reliable CustodianBitcoin vaults are becoming increasingly important as more people and institutions invest in Bitcoin. As digital assets gain legitimacy through legalized financial products, security custody solutions become increasingly vital to protect them from theft and loss. By leveraging advanced technologies such as multi-signature authentication, cold storage, and Hardware Security Modules, Bitcoin vaults provide a robust security solution for digital assets. In addition, multi-layered features ensure secure storage of private keys and means of recovery in case keys are lost or stolen. Bitcoin vaults are not just meant to store BTC securely. They form the bedrock of the asset's long-term viability as an investment vehicle. It is not enough to leave the knowledge to technical experts or institutions. By understanding the importance of secure Bitcoin storage and the advancements in custody solutions, investors can make better-informed decisions about safeguarding their digital assets.This is a guest post by Ivan Serrano.

Bitcoin Magazine,"El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office Celebrates 21 Months of Success, Sets Stage for Renaissance 2.0","Wed, 11 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvadors-bitcoin-office-celebrates-21-months-of-success-sets-stage-for-renaissance-2-0,"The National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) of the Office of the President of El Salvador, led by Stacy Herbert, aims not just to help further integrate Bitcoin into El Salvador’s economy but foster a cultural, artistic and psychological renaissance.","“Someone needs to be the keeper and reiterator of the vision. There's a ton of work to do. When you have to walk a thousand miles and have only taken the first step, it feels like a long way. It really helps if there is someone saying, ‘We are one step closer, and the goal is not a mirage.’” -Steve JobsStacy Herbert, Director of the National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) of the Office of the President of El Salvador, shared the above quote with me, while beaming with both pride and resolve, at the onset of my interview with her.It’s clear that Herbert is on a mission, a mission that started in 2010 when she and her partner, Max Keiser, first discovered Bitcoin and became some of the earliest spokespeople for it soon after. This mission now includes the President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, as well as the bureaucracy and citizens of El Salvador, which has colloquially become known as “Bitcoin country” in Bitcoin circles.By many metrics, The Bitcoin Office has already achieved much success since its founding in December 2022. It’s stockpiled 5,836 bitcoin on behalf of the country. It’s educated 80,000 Salvadoran civil servants on what Bitcoin is and why it’s important. It’s helped implement Bitcoin education from kindergarten to university levels through programs like Mi Primer Bitcoin and CUBO+. And it’s attracted entrepreneurs, investors and other bright minds to the country.While Herbert is proud of these accomplishments, she’s not one to rest on her laurels, especially since she believes that El Salvador’s best days still lie ahead. She has a vision that further Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador will set the stage for a new renaissance, one that will uplift Salvadorans and continue to attract the world’s best to the country. Given the obstacles she’s overcome since first arriving in the country three years ago, it’s difficult to believe she won’t continue to do her part to make this new era for El Salvador happen.Getting Started in El SalvadorHerbert arrived with Keiser in El Salvador toward the latter part of 2021, near the height of that same year’s bitcoin bull market. Euphoria gave way to despair into 2022, though, when bitcoin’s price tanked in part as a result of broader meltdown in the crypto space.“When we first arrived three years ago, bitcoin hit $69,000 and then it proceeded to tumble down to something like $16,000,” Herbert told Bitcoin Magazine.This left Herbert and Keiser tasked with the challenge of explaining to Salvadorans that the collapse of major crypto companies didn’t mean that Bitcoin was dead, nor that it was a mirage.“FTX collapsed, BlockFi collapsed, and Celsius collapsed,” explained Herbert. “When they saw all those collapses, they thought that it was the same thing as Bitcoin — all these scams, all these frauds.”Herbert recalled the importance of steering El Salvador in a bitcoin-not-crypto path at that time.“There were two paths: You could be crypto country or you could be Bitcoin country,” said Herbert.“With crypto country, you're competing with Vegas; you're competing with Macau. The house always wins in those situations. And that's the same thing if you have a crypto economy. You have some wealthy guys who run the house. The pre-mines, the chip owners, the chip dispensers, they always win,” she added, making the point that she didn’t want to see El Salvador exploited by the crypto industry.“Or you could go down the route of what Switzerland was to gold, or New York became to US Treasuries. You could build capital markets. You could build an economy. You could build a Singapore 2.0, an Alexandria 2.0, a Florence 2.0. We pushed for this vision.”Renaissance 2.0In the vision that Herbert shares with President Bukele and Keiser, a senior advisor to Bukele, El Salvador is in the early stages of ushering in one of the greatest eras of human flourishing the world has ever seen.Much like the Renaissance, which occurred in what is now northern Italy just over 500 years ago, El Salvador is setting the stage for its own explosion of entrepreneurship and creativity by adopting that hardest money ever known to man.“Florence first didn't just didn't have DaVinci and Michelangelo and Botticelli and all of the architects, the discoverers, the explorers, the astronomers, and then find perfect money,” explained Herbert. “They found the perfect money of the time — the Florin — and that led to a positive feedback loop of ever more wealth concentrating in Florence versus the other city states of what is now Italy and other regions across Europe,” she added, before sharing that great artists, businesspeople and thinkers flocked to Florence in the wake of its becoming a commercial center.“We think that same sort of process could happen in El Salvador.”Embracing Bukele’s VisionHerbert shared repeatedly in our discussion how El Salvador’s transformation couldn’t have happened without the leadership of Bukele, whose approval rating amongst Salvadorans is still above 90%, making him one of the most popular presidents in the world.A challenge for the ONBTC now, she claims, is getting the rest of the country to see and embrace his vision.“You can't just have President Bukele [believing in Bitcoin],” explained Herbert.“You need at least a portion of his 80,000 civil servants to understand what he is actually trying to achieve. Remember, as the keeper of the vision, we have to pull everybody along to understand President Bukele's vision for El Salvador,” she added.In efforts to get the rest of the country on board, Herbert has hired well-known Bitcoin figures to educate and train Salvadoran Bitcoin developers as well as members of the Salvadoran government.This work started with Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song coming to El Salvador in March 2022 (before the ONBTC was officially established) to teach developers how to work on Bitcoin Core.“Jimmy Song taught his Bitcoin course to seven Salvadorans,” recalled Herbert. “One of them was a guy named Mario Flamenco, who ended up becoming my assistant, my number two at the Bitcoin office.”Giacomo Zucco also came on board to not only teach developers, but also provided three days of Bitcoin education to El Salvador’s civil servants. Herbert explained that the educational efforts are not just to provide El Salvador’s bureaucrats with a deep technical knowledge of Bitcoin, but to reshape their mindset.“They're the people that interact with the population,” said Herbert of El Salvador’s civil servants, “so, they need to understand why they are Bitcoin country in terms of the mindset.”Herbert often referred to the importance of mindset during our discussion. She explained that the work the ONBTC does is about more than just helping people to understand what Bitcoin is, but it’s about mentally and emotionally prepping them to be great.“In order to be extraordinary, [you have to have] people in the government and in the population who are ready to be extraordinary,” she said.“We're training a population to have the mindset to be Florence 2.0, to be Singapore 2.0 — to be something extraordinary,” she added.“You need everybody to be on the same page in terms of just how important they are. What we're doing here is extraordinary. What President Bukele has delivered to the country is quite extraordinary.”Passport ProgramsThrough ONBTC, Bukele is prepping Salvadorans for great things, while through El Salvador’s passport programs, he’s looking to attract those who have a track record of doing great things.On April 6, 2024, Bukele announced that El Salvador would issue 5,000 passports to the likes of scientists, doctors and even philosophers.We're offering 5,000 free passports (equivalent to $5 billion in our passport program) to highly skilled scientists, engineers, doctors, artists, and philosophers from abroad.This represents less than 0.1% of our population, so granting them full citizen status, including…— Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) April 6, 2024  As Bukele shared in his tweet, these 5,000 passports are technically worth $5 billion. El Salvador now issues passports nearly instantly for those who make a $1 million investment in the country with either BTC or USDT.While this program was designed to attract top talent from abroad, it also had positive effects on the psychology of the Salvadoran people, according to Herbert.“What we did with the million dollar price tag worked,” said Herbert. “If you go back, Salvadoran people started saying, ‘My God, some people were paying $10,000 to coyotes to take them over the border in the US, and my passport is worth $1 million.' Even if a thousand Salvadorans think that, it changes the mindset enough that it's a critical seed of change,” she added.What’s Next for The Bitcoin Office?Herbert said that ONBTC has some big announcements coming in the next three to four weeks. For now, though, the ONBTC is focused on unveiling the first Bitcoin banks, which she believes will help El Salvador build capital markets.“Bitcoin banks will come here, and we'll start seriously building the capital markets that are needed — like we've laid the foundation for greatness over the past 21 months,” said Herbert.Beyond Bitcoin banks, Herbert seems confident that the sky's the limit as far as what comes next for El Salvador. Thanks to the ONBTC, a foundation has been set for the revitalization of the country.“We have the education, we have the mindset, we have the rebrand — the greatest rebrand in history — as I call it for El Salvador, and we have an increasing amount of popularity for President Bukele, because he keeps winning,” she said. “We’ve walked a thousand miles in the last 21 months, and we now have another thousand-mile journey to start.”Editor’s note: We normally profile founders of startups for our Founders series, but, this week, we chose to profile the head of a government institution who's led that institutions since its inception."
Bitcoin Magazine,Early Bitcoin Developer Backs Satoshi Nakamoto Theory,"Wed, 11 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/lone-genius-bitcoin-developer-satoshi-nakamoto-theory,A Bitcoin developer from 2010 has gone public with his support for a theory about the project's anonymous founder.,"Jeff Garzik, a veteran Linux contributor and early open-source developer who contributed to the Bitcoin project from 2010 to 2017, has released a series of new videos detailing his time working with Bitcoin’s anonymous inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. Joining the project in July 2010, Garzik contributed to early software releases, entering notable pull requests including the first proposal to raise the block size limit, as well as the first proposal to eliminate subsidies for free transactions. Under Satoshi’s time as maintainer, Garzik had pull requests accepted, including for work separating the mining code from the Satoshi client.Most notably, the new videos find Garzik sharing recollections about his time with Satoshi, including new commentary on whether Satoshi was indeed a singular individual or a group.""Satoshi as a coder, he’s more the ‘A Beautiful Mind’ type lone genius,” Garzik recalls. “When I was a computer science major, we thought highly of ourselves as coders, and we would notice that some of the other disciplines, the chemists, the biologists, the physicists, they had to do it, but they didn’t approach it as a profession. Satoshi was the same way.”In this way, Garzik says he believes Satoshi knew what problem he wanted to solve, but that lacked an understanding of “modularity,” “unit testing,” and other basics that “computer science majors learn.”“He very wisely pulled cryptographic solutions off the shelf that were well known, well studied, and he put all those together in a new and interesting way,” Garzik said, adding:“My impression was that he studied existing people on the internet and tried to think how to combine existing crypto primitives in field use to create Bitcoin.”Elsewhere, Garzik attested to his belief that Satoshi was a “self-taught” programmer, arguing Bitcoin’s founder was humble about his limitations. In other statements he spoke to Satoshi’s temperament and working methods, noting his strict focus on Bitcoin.“Satoshi would never stray from that topic. He would never let slip any personal information whatsoever, never talk about his mood, the time of day,” he says in one clip. “It was always 100% all about Bitcoin.”All told, the recollections cover a period of 6 months through Nakamoto’s resignation from the project in January 2011, at which point Garzik’s friend and collaborator Gavin Andresen took over as lead maintainer. The videos come during a year in which other early Bitcoin contributors have gone public in releasing correspondence with Satoshi, with Martti ‘Sirius’ Malmi and Adam Back publishing hundreds of pages of never-before-seen emails in connection with a public trial in the U.K.While Garzik has yet to release emails with Satoshi, the videos, produced by a new venture he founded, Hemi Network, represent the most public discussion the developer has had on the subject in some time. Launched in July, the Hemi Network is advertised as “a modular Layer-2 protocol for superior scaling, security, and interoperability, powered by Bitcoin and Ethereum.” The work follows a period after 2017 in which Garzik has become more interested in blockchain networks that are not tied to any specific base layer cryptocurrency, a path that includes Metronome, a project from 2017 that also sought compatibility with multiple blockchains.Garzik left the Bitcoin project that year after serving as the lead maintainer for a hard fork of the Bitcoin protocol that despite early startup ecosystem support never formally launched. The full video playlist can be accessed below:"

This represents a 3.04% increase over the last 24 hours and continues an upward trajectory in mining competition.JUST IN: #Bitcoin mining difficulty hit a NEW ALL-TIME HIGH 🚀 pic.twitter.com/vhq0ClEXRW— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 11, 2024  The Bitcoin difficulty chart plots the historical increases and decreases in mining difficulty over time. It measures how hard it is for miners to find a valid hash for the next block. Higher difficulty requires more computing power to mine new Bitcoin.When combined with the Bitcoin price, difficulty helps determine miners' profitability and return on investment. The metric soared in 2024 amid massive growth in Bitcoin's overall hash rate and adoption.The rising difficulty shows intensifying competition on the Bitcoin network as more miners fight for limited block rewards. This is generally constructive for network security and decentralization.Despite rough market conditions this year, the difficulty increase displays the unprecedented demand for Bitcoin block rewards. It underlines the incredible security offered by the collective computing power of miners around the world.The difficulty adjustment algorithm built into Bitcoin's code dictates the pace of change in mining competition. It is programmed to find blocks approximately every 10 minutes, maintaining a steady influx of new Bitcoin over time.This predictable Bitcoin issuance schedule makes its inflation rate easy to model and appeals to investors compared to fiat currencies subject to central bank policies."

Crypto Potato,Hackers Steal $243 Million In Bitcoin Scam – But Doxxed Themselves On Discord,"Thu, 19 Sep 2024",https://cryptopotato.com/hackers-steal-243-million-in-bitcoin-scam-but-doxxed-themselves-on-discord/,The culprits stole nearly 4100 BTC and spent it on luxury goods before being arrested this week.,"Blockchain detective ZachXBT has exposed another set of hackers who used a social engineering scam to steal over $240 million in Bitcoin from a wealthy victim. The investigator said that both his efforts and the criminals’ own blunders have already led to “multiple arrests and millions frozen.” Scammed For 4000 BTC In mid-August, the scammers targeted a single creditor to Genesis – the institutional Bitcoin trading desk that went bankrupt in early 2023. First, the scammers called the victim pretending to be Google support using a spoofed phone number and gained access to the victim’s personal accounts. They then called again pretending to be Gemini support, warning the victim that their accounts were hacked. Through this, they prompted the victim to reset his two-factor authentication and send his Gemini funds to a compromised wallet. Meanwhile, the scammers fooled the victim into downloading the remote desktop application AnyDesk, which let them see the victim’s screen, and view his private key via Bitcoin Core. The hackers recorded their audio and screens as they celebrated pulling off the hack, which netted them 4,064 BTC worth $257 million at today’s price. “An initial tracing showed $243M split multiple ways between each party before funds quickly peeled off to 15+ exchanges immediately swapping back and forth between Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Monero,” added ZachXBT. Identifying The Culprits The investigator linked the distribution of the funds to the wallets of the parties involved with the theft. One of the three main culprits who went by “Wiz” was identified as Veer Chetal after he mistakenly leaked his full name during a screenshare. Chetal’s friend Light also leaked his real name, Aakaash, during a screen share. Greavys, whose real name is Malone Lam and was responsible for finding details related to the target in his mail, spent much of his stolen money on luxury cars, nightclubs, and giving Birkin bags to girls. Box (Jeandhil Serrano), the man who called the victim as a pretend Gemini exchange rep, also spent much of his funds on luxury goods. However, ZachXBT said both Box and Greavys mistakenly linked their “dirty funds” connected to centralized exchanges with their funds that were supposed to be private on multiple occasions. Yesterday evening, both Box and Greavys were arrested in Miami and LA. Over million of their stolen funds have been seized with help from Binance, and $500,000 has been returned back to the victim. An indictment of the case against both individuals was unsealed later on Thursday.

[&#8230;]","[PRESS RELEASE – Singapore, Asia, September 19th, 2024] Harvard Students and Alumni Launch Groundbreaking Native Bitcoin Blockchain Project at Harvard Innovation Labs to Tackle Global Debt Crisis    Launch of “New Bretton Woods Project” (NBW): A Harvard-led initiative, soon to be incubated at Harvard Innovation Labs, tackling the global debt crisis through decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions.  Native Bitcoin Stablecoin: NBW is developing a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin via BeL2 infrastructure, offering stability while preserving Bitcoin’s decentralization and security.  Economic Disruption and Resilience: The project aims to reshape global finance by leveraging Bitcoin and DeFi to promote economic stability and empower users in the face of rising global debt.  In a bold step to transform the global financial landscape, the Digital Economy Research Initiative, led by a dynamic group of Harvard students and alumni, has officially launched the “New Bretton Woods Project” (NBW). This pioneering blockchain-based initiative has secured membership in Harvard’s prestigious Innovation Labs and is set to begin incubation there in the coming weeks. NBW aims to tackle the escalating global debt crisis by offering innovative, technology-driven solutions. At the heart of the project is the development of a native Bitcoin stablecoin, leveraging the transformative potential of decentralized finance (DeFi). Built on the innovative BeL2 infrastructure, NBW aims to reshape global financial systems, unlocking new possibilities for debt management and financial stability across nations. With the power of DeFi and blockchain, NBW stands poised to disrupt the status quo, offering a bold new path toward economic resilience in the face of one of the greatest challenges of our time. This initiative signals not just a step, but a leap toward a decentralized, stable and secure economic future. The project reframes Bitcoin as not just a store of value but the foundation of a decentralized financial system. Using BeL2—Bitcoin’s second-layer solution—the NBW project enables smart contracts for Bitcoin-backed stablecoin construction, empowering users to engage in decentralized finance while preserving Bitcoin’s core principles of decentralization and security. “Harvard Innovation Labs will help turn our vision into reality,” said Jacob, Lead Member of New Bretton Woods (NBW) at Harvard University. “Our goal is to create a ‘New Bretton Woods’ system anchored in Bitcoin, bringing stability through the utility of a stablecoin. This stablecoin allows users to bypass Bitcoin’s price volatility while retaining the potential for long-term gain, making the product practical for daily use.” The native Bitcoin stablecoin will be fully backed by Bitcoin, enabling users to experience the stability of fiat currency without liquidating their Bitcoin holdings. This offers a balance of algorithmic security using Bitcoin miners and the opportunity for long-term growth. The BeL2 infrastructure allows for decentralized finance applications, where Bitcoin remains securely on the main network. Bitcoin can be used as collateral for Layer 2 applications such as decentralized exchanges, loans, and stablecoin issuance. The NBW team ensures that all Bitcoin-related settlements occur on the Bitcoin main network for maximum security. Instead of transferring assets across chains, messages are sent to Ethereum-compatible networks to issue stablecoin, uniting technologies and supporting a robust decentralized economy. “Financial empowerment comes from both freedom and stability,” added Sasha Mitchell, Head of Operations at BeL2. “By offering a stablecoin backed by Bitcoin on the BeL2 platform, NBW is giving people a way to protect their wealth and access new financial opportunities, especially in times of economic volatility.” “This initiative comes at a crucial time as global debt reaches record levels. By combining Bitcoin’s decentralized structure with the stability of a pegged currency, the project offers a financial system that mitigates the risks of traditional economies, highlighting the real-world benefits of financial security and sovereignty. Our stablecoin isn’t just another digital currency; it’s a tool for global financial stability,” said Jacob, Lead Member of the NBW project. “We believe that offering a decentralized and stable currency helps individuals and communities navigate the growing challenges posed by the global debt crisis.” The NBW team invites those who share their vision for a decentralized and secure financial future to explore how they can contribute. Whether you’re a developer, an investor, or a policymaker interested in sustainable financial solutions, this project offers a unique chance to shape a future focused on security, accessibility, and freedom. About New Bretton Woods Project (NBW)  The project is led by Digital Economy Research Initiative, a team of Harvard students and alumni. NBW is set to be incubated at Harvard Innovation Labs in the coming weeks. Focused on bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems, the team is committed to advancing financial inclusivity and economic stability. About Harvard Innovation Labs  Harvard Innovation Labs is a collaborative ecosystem that supports entrepreneurship across Harvard University. It provides resources, mentorship, and funding to students, faculty, and alumni as they develop practical solutions in fields like technology and finance. About BeL2 BeL2 is Bitcoin’s second-layer solution that enables decentralized finance (DeFi) while keeping Bitcoin secure on its main chain. By providing users with the ability to lend, borrow, and trade without intermediaries, BeL2 ensures financial freedom while preserving Bitcoin’s core principles of decentralization. With BeL2, users retain full control over their Bitcoin while accessing new financial opportunities.

Crypto Potato,Bitcoin Whales Signal Confidence as Net Inflows Remain Positive,"Thu, 19 Sep 2024",https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-whales-signal-confidence-as-net-inflows-remain-positive/,The last instance of weekly negative flow among these whales occurred in May.,"Despite a slowdown in Bitcoin (BTC) whale accumulation, the weekly net flows among these large holders (addresses with at least 1,000 BTC) have remained positive for nearly four months. Positive net flows indicate that more BTC is entering these wallets than leaving, suggesting potential buying pressure, while negative net flows mean more BTC is flowing out of these entities. Whales See Consistent Inflow According to data from IntoTheBlock, the weekly net inflow peaked at 27K BTC (worth approximately $1.7 billion in current prices) in June. Subsequently, whales experienced a weekly inflow of 19K BTC ($1.2 billion) in July, 18K BTC ($1.13 billion) in August, and 9K BTC ($556.9 million) in September. The last time these wallets experienced negative net flows was in May, according to ITB.  Although $BTC whale accumulation has decelerated, the weekly net flow has stayed positive for nearly four months. The last instance of a net weekly outflow among large holders was back in May. https://t.co/NhVCP3gxOd pic.twitter.com/LlZvz7bEma — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) September 19, 2024  Bullish on Bitcoin Bitcoin whales are known to be crucial market signals. The sustained positive net flows from whales’ wallets suggest a bullish indicator for the digital asset. More BTC going into these wallets than flowing out suggests that they are confident in the future market value of the leading crypto asset. However, it is important to note that the pace of Bitcoin whale accumulation has decelerated compared to earlier this year. This, on the other hand, can be seen as a bearish signal. While data from IntoTheBlock suggests a slowdown in whales’ accumulation, it also noted that these long-term holders’ BTC stashes have recently stabilized. According to the on-chain analytics platforms, long-term holders currently possess 12.6 million BTC, valued at $793.674 billion. Earlier this month, CryptoPotato reported that Bitcoin wallets with at least 100 BTC hit a 17-month high. This surge was propelled by 283 new wallets holding 100 BTC or more over the past month. Bitcoin trades at $63,000 at press time, representing a 5% surge on the day and a 9% increase over the past week.

[…]The postLouisiana continues pro-crypto push with option to pay state agencies in Bitcoin, USDCappeared first onCryptoSlate.","Louisiana has implemented a new option for residents to make payments to state agencies using Bitcoin and Circle’s stablecoin USDC, according to a Sept. 18 press release. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries will be the first agency to accept these payments, with the possibility of expansion to other state departments in the future. Secretary Madison Sheahan said offering digital payment options aligns with the department’s goal of enhancing customer service. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries has already processed the first payment through the new system and received a payment via the Bitcoin Lightning network. Louisiana State Treasurer John Fleming said the transition aims to provide residents with more flexibility while ensuring that the state remains protected from the volatility of crypto markets. As such, payments made in crypto will be converted into US dollars at the time of the transaction. Fleming said: “By introducing cryptocurrency as a payment option, we are providing another way for citizens to interact with state services while maintaining safeguards to ensure the state’s financial stability.” The system will be supported by Bead Pay, a company specializing in crypto payments. The firm will facilitate the conversion of digital currencies into US dollars. The state will not hold cryptocurrency directly, and funds will be deposited into state accounts similarly to traditional debit or credit card transactions. State Representative Mark Wright (R-Covington), who has been a proponent of digital assets legislation, welcomed the expansion of payment options, saying: “This is a positive step forward in offering new technologies for residents to engage with state government.” Lousiana’s pro-Bitcoin push The move to accept crypto payments for state services follows a series of pro-crypto policies by the Louisiana government. Earlier this year, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry signed a bill banning central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and safeguarding the rights of residents to self-custody and mine crypto. The bill, HB 488, prohibited state authorities from participating in federal tests related to CBDCs and ensured that individuals and businesses could freely use and store crypto. The legislation also protected home and commercial crypto mining activities, positioning Louisiana as a state open to innovation in the digital asset space. The latest move to integrate cryptocurrency payments with state services builds on this momentum, highlighting the state’s broader commitment to embracing digital financial technologies while balancing regulatory oversight.

According to FalconX head of research David Lawant, the high volume paired with the liquidity setup shown in the past six months could be a sign of impending high volatility. ‘Coiled spring’ Lawant noted that the current spot volume is nearly 30% higher than the daily average during August, which indicates that liquidity is significantly stronger during periods of recovery compared to sell-offs. He echoed the sentiment recently shared by Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, saying that liquidity dynamics in the crypto market look like a “coiled spring.” Glassnode also compared BTC’s current price action to a coiling spring in a report published before the Fed’s decision. According to the report, the coiled spring setup was formed because the price has been compressed within “a well-defined range” over the past six months. Historically, only August 2023 and May 2016 registered a 180-day price range tighter than the current one. It added that macro events like the Fed’s interest rate cut release the “pressure” built up over the period, which often leads to high market volatility. Additionally, CryptoQuant CEO and founder Ki Young Ju highlighted that institutions are not shorting Bitcoin aggressively, which is another improvement in market conditions. He added that CME futures net positions have fallen 75% since April, and are close to early October 2023 levels. Potential for a burst Glassnode also noted that both inflows and outflows from the market have become mute, which indicated that Bitcoin has entered a state of “equilibrium.” Furthermore, net realized profit and loss are “largely equal,” and the absolute realized profit plus loss has declined significantly since Bitcoin’s all-time high in March. Both metrics suggest that buy-side pressure is low in the current price range, which translates to low demand for Bitcoin. Glassnode also noted that the “Hot Supply” of Bitcoin, a metric used to define BTC holdings that are more likely to be transferred, is at a significantly low level. These wallets represent only 4.7% of the on-chain value, which suggests that the supply side is also constricted. The report also highlighted that the rising stablecoin supply, currently at $160.4 billion, could break this predicament by adding purchasing power to the market, which would result in ultimate friction between inactivity and demand. However, the report added that this supply must rotate in the market for this to happen, triggering the coiled spring mentioned by analysts.

Hut 8 plans to deploy this model in the second quarter of 2025 through a hosting agreement that could expand its hashrate under management to approximately 33.5 exahash per second (EH/s). The U3S21EXPH marks a significant development in ASIC computing by integrating cooling technology typically used in high-performance computing data centers. This miner shifts from the traditional “shoebox” design to a rack-ready U form factor, allowing deployment densities of up to about 180 kilowatts per rack. Hut 8 has developed a custom data center infrastructure to accommodate this new hardware, aiming to optimize performance and efficiency. Currently, the best-performing miner on the market is the Bitmain S21 Pro, which runs at 234TH/s. The new miner is over three times more powerful and 3 J/TH more efficient. Per the announcement, the partnership between Hut 8 and Bitmain extends beyond procurement. The companies collaborated on both technical and commercial aspects, with Hut 8 contributing to the miner’s development. The hosting agreement features a fixed hosting fee and provides Hut 8 with an option to purchase all or part of the hosted machines within six months of their activation. This structure is designed to reduce upfront capital requirements and allow Hut 8 to assess market conditions before committing additional funds. If Hut 8 exercises this option fully, its self-mining hashrate could increase from 5.6 EH/s to approximately 20.6 EH/s. Bitmain’s Vice President of Mining, Irene Gao, acknowledged Hut 8’s role in the development process, noting the company’s focus on cost-efficient procurement and operations. The collaboration is seen as a natural evolution of their relationship, aiming to define the future of mining technology. Hut 8’s Chief Executive Officer, Asher Genoot, emphasized the innovative nature of the hosting agreement and its benefits, stating, “Our team worked closely with BITMAIN to implement an innovative structure to commercialize the U3S21EXPH before it became available to the broader market.” The deployment of the U3S21EXPH and the associated hosting agreement represent a strategic move for Hut 8. By integrating advanced cooling technologies and flexible procurement strategies, the company seeks to enhance its operational capabilities and financial performance.

On September 18, Trump reportedly purchased hamburgers using Bitcoin at Pubkey, an NYC establishment, during a campaign event, according to a post by Pubkey on X. Alongside Trump, other notable figures, including BTC advocate and Professional Capital Management CEO Anthony Pompliano, also attended the event. Trump Buys Burger for Attendees Videos shared on X show Trump buying at least a dozen hamburgers. He distributed them to attendees, referring to them as “crypto burgers.”  Former President Donald Trump uses Bitcoin to buy burgers at @PUBKEY_NYC.pic.twitter.com/1Nw9rwRWJX— THE COIN (@thecoinlive) September 18, 2024  The appearance comes shortly after Trump announced the launch of a token through the World Liberty Financial crypto platform, managed by his family members. Notably, World Liberty Financial will be a crypto banking ecosystem where users can borrow, lend, and invest in cryptocurrencies. The project will sell a non-transferable governance token called WLFI and plans to limit participation to accredited investors. The token structure will see 20% of the tokens reserved for the founding team, 17% set aside for user rewards, and the remaining 63% available to the public. Despite previously labeling Bitcoin a “scam” and describing cryptocurrencies as “based on thin air,” the former president has shifted his tone. His 2024 campaign has shown support for Bitcoin miners and included an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville. Trump’s involvement with Bitcoin is notable given that he reportedly holds at least $1 million in cryptocurrency assets. His use of Bitcoin at the event marks a significant moment, especially considering that another former president, Bill Clinton, has also held Bitcoin since it was given to him at a 2016 event. Harris Avoids Crypto In contrast to Trump, Vice President Kamala Harris has not made cryptocurrency a focal point of her campaign. However, Future Forward, a political action committee supporting the Democratic candidate, does accept cryptocurrency donations, indicating a nuanced approach to digital assets within the party. Just recently, investment Bank Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick said Bitcoin is expected to end the year at new all-time highs regardless of who wins the US election. Kendrick suggested that Bitcoin could reach new all-time highs by the end of 2024 due to “positive drivers dominating regardless of the election outcome.” “I think Bitcoin ends the year higher, at new all-time highs, no matter who wins the U.S. election, with a Trump win taking it to $125,000 and $75,000 if it’s Harris.” It is worth noting that Harris’ chances of winning the upcoming U.S. presidential election surged on Polymarket following her debate with Trump last week. As of now, Harris’ chance of winning the upcoming election stands at 52%, ahead of Trump at 46%.

Crypto News,Rich Dad Poor Dad Author Kiyosaki Predicts Bitcoin Boom – Could Soaring Inflation Push BTC Price to New ATH? ,"Thu, 19 Sep 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-kiyosaki-predicts-bitcoin/,"Robert Kiyosaki predicts a Bitcoin boom fueled by soaring inflation and potential Federal Reserve pivots, urging investors to act before BTC reaches new all-time highs.The postRich Dad Poor Dad Author Kiyosaki Predicts Bitcoin Boom – Could Soaring Inflation Push BTC Price to New ATH?appeared first onCryptonews."," Robert Kiyosaki, the renowned author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has never shied away from offering bold financial predictions, and his latest one involves Bitcoin (BTC).  In a recent tweet, Kiyosaki emphasized that a Bitcoin boom may be on the horizon, driven in part by escalating inflation and a possible shift in the Federal Reserve’s policies.  He likens this impending surge in BTC to the rising value of other real assets such as gold and silver, assets which, according to him, could skyrocket when the Fed pivots to lowering interest rates.  Bitcoin, gold, silver prices about toEXPLODE….As stated in my previous tweet…. you talkers….cowards discussing which is better…. Gold or Bitcoin…will be Big Losers… when Marxist  Fed PIVOTS…cutting interest rates…and real assets go up in price…as fake money leaves fake…— Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) September 14, 2024  Kiyosaki’s financial philosophy has long revolved around the idea of investing in tangible assets—ones that hold intrinsic value over time. With U.S. bonds and fiat currencies losing credibility, he argues that “fake money” will leave “fake assets” and seek refuge in “real assets” like Bitcoin, gold, and silver.  This is especially true, he believes, as inflation continues to erode the value of cash, and the Federal Reserve eventually reduces interest rates to spur economic activity. In his typical straightforward style, Kiyosaki warns that people who debate whether Bitcoin is better than gold will be left behind—what he refers to as “loser talk.” He urges investors to stop theorizing and start acting by acquiring more of these real assets before it’s too late. Ultimately, Kiyosaki’s message is clear: those who own assets like Bitcoin and gold will not only preserve their wealth but potentially grow it as inflation accelerates and interest rates drop. The question is not if Bitcoin will rise, but when, and for Kiyosaki, that moment could be coming soon. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Daily Technical Outlook – September 19, 2024 Bitcoin (BTC/USD) chart shows strong upward momentum after breaking through the key resistance level of $61,326. A sharp green candlestick indicates a significant bullish move, signaling renewed buying interest.  The price has now risen above the 50-period EMA (Exponential Moving Average) at $59,709, further confirming this bullish trend. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) also indicates strength, currently hovering around 70, which suggests that Bitcoin is nearing overbought conditions. However, the RSI is not yet in extreme territory, meaning there may still be room for further price increases.  The next resistance level to watch is $62,618. If Bitcoin breaks above this point, the upward momentum could accelerate, potentially pushing BTC toward the next resistance at $63,605.  On the downside, $61,326 now acts as strong support, and failure to hold this level could trigger a retest of lower supports near $60,217 or even $59,709.

Binance Labs, Breyer Capital, and Big Brain Holdings led the first fundraising round, backing plans to combine the powers of Bitcoin and Ethereum into one “supernetwork.”   The Hemi team is proud to announce the closing of its $15M strategic seed round, led by @binancelabs, @breyercap, and @BigBrainVC. Excited for what's to come!https://t.co/E1zxMW6VqC #bitcoin #ethereum pic.twitter.com/P4T1apIE3j— Hemi Network (@hemi_xyz) September 18, 2024  Co-founder Max Sanchez said the company plans to use these funds to expand Hemi’s engineering team, add more Bitcoin interoperability features, and offer developers advanced customizability, incentivization, grants, and community adoption. What Hemi Labs Brings to the Table  Hemi Labs seeks to tackle a multi-billion dollar problem in the DeFi space, addressing the $2.8 billion lost in DeFi bridge hacks by 2024. The company opposes centralized bridges that “reintroduce trust into a supposedly trustless system,” the firm added in an X thread. The Hemi Bitcoin Kit (hBK) is another innovation from Hemi Labs, designed to enable developers to work with Bitcoin more effectively.  This kit unlocks features such as trustless smart contracts and decentralized financial products, which were previously difficult to implement directly on the Bitcoin network.  With the hBK, developers can create applications like Bitcoin (re)staking, Bitcoin-enabled lending markets, and democratized Bitcoin Miner Extractable Value (MEV) marketplaces. Also, PoP’s modular nature enables Hemi to extend this security efficiently to other blockchains. Hemi summarised:   It enables developers to build trustless dApps that combine Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum’s programmability. This opens up new possibilities for complex decentralized applications.  How Hemi’s Novel PoP Consensus Protocol Works Hemi Labs’ consensus mechanism, Proof-of-Proof (PoP), is a novel approach that emerged from field tests by Veriblock before Hemi Labs acquired the company in 2023. The PoP protocol allows Hemi to  “inherit Bitcoin’s robust security while maintaining Ethereum’s flexibility,” something proposed to use “and exceed” Bitcoin’s security. The PoP consensus mechanism predates BitVM but enables what Garzik calls “superfinality,” securing transactions with minimal delay, achieving full finality within 2 hours or 12 Bitcoin blocks, notably quicker than other optimistic fraud-proof systems. Hemi miners play a crucial role by publishing network data to the Bitcoin blockchain. Once Bitcoin confirms this data, it inherits the same security level as Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism, ensuring that Bitcoin’s established security protects Hemi’s transactions. A key component of Hemi’s infrastructure is the Hemi Virtual Machine (hVM), which is a full Bitcoin node integrated within an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).  The hVM tracks Bitcoin’s state in real time, eliminating the need for third-party data relayers and reducing associated risks. This direct connection enhances the security and reliability of Hemi’s operations. By tackling key security challenges and offering a unique blend of Bitcoin’s security and Ethereum’s flexibility, Hemi aims to establish a more robust and trustworthy decentralized infrastructure.

Going into this week’s meeting, Wall Street had been split over whether the Fed would cut interest rates for the first time since 2020 by 25 or 50bps.  So, the decision to opt for a larger 50bps cut to the target range of the federal funds rate would have surprised some market participants. But that wasn’t the only dovish aspect of the policy announcement.  The Fed’s graphic showing the interest rate forecasts of its members called the dot-plot, showed that the median Fed policymaker expects a further 150bps in rate cuts by the end of 2025.

The ingredients for a Fed-fueled rally in crypto markets appear to be falling into place. The Fed looks intent on aggressively lowering interest rates but remains upbeat on the economy. That’s potentially a “goldilocks” scenario for risk assets, and major US equities could vault to fresh record highs as a result. Meanwhile, the US dollar and US yields should probably continue to subside. This is a potentially very bullish macro backdrop for Bitcoin. As long as US recession fears don’t suddenly surge back, the stage could be set for BTC heading back towards $70,000 in the coming weeks.   Of course, US election uncertainty remains high. Polymarket has Democrat Presidential nominee Kamala Harris as the slight favorite.  While a victory for Republican nominee and former President Trump might be better for the market in the short-term, it likely won’t matter too much in the long run, with Harris potentially open to a softer stance on the crypto industry than the current Biden administration. Major market rallies usually follow US Presidential elections as uncertainty clears up. The delayed-bullish impact of the BTC halving could also come into play in the final quarter.

Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Forks: Pathways to Innovation or Disruptive Forces?,"Mon, 23 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-forks-pathways-to-innovation-or-disruptive-forces,A look at the history of major Bitcoin forks.,"Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has undergone several forks, or splits, that have given rise to new cryptocurrencies and variations of the original protocol. As of May 2024, there are over 100 Bitcoin forks in existence, with varying degrees of adoption and success.These forks have sparked intense debates within the cryptocurrency community. Some view them as catalysts for innovation and progress, while others perceive them as disruptive forces that undermine the network's stability and core values.And this dichotomy is precisely what we’ll zero in on today. We’ll look at why these forks happened, what they have achieved, and what they mean for Bitcoin's future.Major Bitcoin Forks and Their ImpactEven though the nascent Bitcoin community was anything but cohesive, people were still somewhat successful in implementing Satoshi’s vision. However, the first crack appeared with the creation of Bitcoin XT in 2014, which fractured the community but provided a valuable lesson in governance. This crypto schism occurred due to the devs’ wishes to increase the block size from one to eight megabytes, but others thought this was going too far. Thus, Bitcoin Classic (now shut down), with 2MB block sizes, was born, followed by Bitcoin Unlimited going in a completely opposite direction with gargantuan 16MB blocks. However, this was followed by truly impactful forks, ones whose impact is felt even today. This includes: Bitcoin Cash (BCH)Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was created on August 1, 2017, as a result of a hard fork from Bitcoin. The primary motivation behind this fork was to address Bitcoin’s scalability issues, particularly the slow transaction times and high fees that resulted from Bitcoin's 1MB block size limit. Proponents of Bitcoin Cash, including influential figures like Roger Ver, argued that increasing the block size would allow for more transactions per block, thus reducing fees and speeding up transaction times.Upon its creation, Bitcoin Cash quickly gained attention and was adopted by several exchanges and merchants. It also saw an initial surge in value, reaching a significant market capitalization. Over time, Bitcoin Cash has continued to evolve, with ongoing development and updates aimed at improving its functionality and scalability. It has maintained a dedicated community of supporters who believe in its potential as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. However, it faces competition from other cryptocurrencies that also aim to offer low fees and fast transaction times. Today, the debate over scalability and transaction fees continues to influence Bitcoin Cash's direction and development. Bitcoin SV (BSV)Bitcoin SV (Satoshi Vision) emerged on November 15, 2018, following a contentious split from Bitcoin Cash. The fork was driven by disagreements within the Bitcoin Cash community, particularly regarding further block size increases and the direction of development. The project was spearheaded by Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre, who aimed to restore what they viewed as Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision of Bitcoin.Bitcoin SV significantly increased the block size limit, initially to 128MB and then to 2GB, allowing for a much higher volume of transactions. The proponents of BSV argue that this large block size is necessary for the network to support enterprise-level applications and massive transaction volumes.Likewise, this significant increase in block size has also led to concerns about centralization, as running a full node becomes more resource-intensive.Bitcoin SV remains a controversial fork within the broader Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community. Its focus on large block sizes and high transaction throughput positions it uniquely among major cryptocurrencies. However, it still faces ongoing challenges in achieving widespread acceptance, with Coinbase finally dumping it for good in 2023.Bitcoin Gold (BTG)Bitcoin Gold was created on October 24, 2017, with the aim of making Bitcoin mining more decentralized. It achieved this by altering the mining algorithm from Bitcoin's SHA-256 to Equihash, which is more resistant to ASIC mining. This change was intended to allow more people to mine BTG using regular GPUs, reducing the dominance of large mining farms and truly democratizing the token.Bitcoin Gold uses the Equihash algorithm, which is designed to be memory-intensive and resistant to ASIC mining hardware. This divergence aims to democratize mining by making it more accessible to individuals.Bitcoin Gold saw initial enthusiasm and was adopted by several exchanges. However, it has faced security challenges, including a major 51% attack in 2018 that resulted in $70,000 worth of double spend.Today, Bitcoin Gold continues to exist as a smaller player in the cryptocurrency market. Its focus on decentralizing mining remains its primary distinguishing feature, though it has struggled to gain the same level of adoption and market presence as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV.The Motivations Behind Bitcoin ForksBitcoin forks occur for various reasons, driven by a mix of ideological, technical, and economic motivations. For example, one of the primary drivers for Bitcoin forks has been the need to address scalability issues. As Bitcoin's popularity grew, the network faced challenges in handling an increasing number of transactions, leading to longer confirmation times and higher fees. Forks have also been initiated to introduce technical improvements or new features to the Bitcoin protocol. These could include changes to the consensus mechanism, enhanced privacy features, or the introduction of smart contract capabilitiesIn some cases, personal motivations, such as power struggles, ideological differences, or financial incentives, have contributed to the creation of Bitcoin forks. If you pay attention to the historical volatility of forks such as Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Cash, you will notice that some people viewed them as investment vehicles.For example, Bitcoin Cash, which split from Bitcoin in August 2017, saw its price surge to around $4,355 in December 2017, shortly after its inception. However, it later stabilized and traded within a range of $200 to $500 over the following years.How These Major Forks Have Impacted Bitcoin Aside from the obvious impact, the increase in threats to the OG BTC, major forks have had both a tangible and intangible effect on the crypto community as a whole. Truth be told, none of these forks have emerged as legitimate solutions to cash flow problems, but their impact is nonetheless Market VolatilityBitcoin forks often lead to heightened market volatility. For instance, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fork in August 2017 caused notable price fluctuations in both Bitcoin and the newly created Bitcoin Cash. Before the fork, Bitcoin's price was around $2,800, but it dropped to $2,700 immediately after the fork. Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, started trading at approximately $555​.Similarly, Bitcoin SV (BSV), which split from Bitcoin Cash in 2018, has seen its price swing dramatically. In January 2020, BSV peaked at around $441.20, but by June 2024, its price had dropped to around $63​. These fluctuations are often driven by investor speculation and market manipulation, with some viewing these forks as opportunities for financial gains.Network Scalability and DevelopmentForks have also spurred significant debates and developments regarding Bitcoin's scalability. The original Bitcoin network has limitations, such as a one-megabyte block size and ten-minute block creation time, which constrain its transaction throughput. As mentioned previously, these limitations led to the creation of Bitcoin Cash, which increased the block size to 8MB to handle more transactions per block​​.The forks highlighted the need for scalability solutions, prompting various projects and protocols to enhance Bitcoin's transaction capacity. One prominent example is the Lightning Network, a layer-two solution designed to facilitate faster and cheaper transactions by creating off-chain payment channelsSecurity ConcernsSome forks have introduced security vulnerabilities. For instance, the lower hash rate and interest in Bitcoin SV have made it more susceptible to 51% attacks, where a malicious actor can control the majority of the network's mining power, compromising its security. This has, unfortunately, led to concerns about the long-term viability and security of certain Bitcoin forks. What’s the point of further forking if organized malicious actors can seize control so easily? ConclusionAs the cryptocurrency market matures and becomes increasingly integrated with traditional financial systems, the impact of Bitcoin forks on the wider economy cannot be understated. The success or failure of these forks will not only affect the fortunes of individual investors and businesses but could also have ramifications for the stability and security of the global financial infrastructure.Ultimately, the future of Bitcoin and its forks will depend on the community's ability to find common ground and work towards a shared vision of a decentralized, inclusive, and resilient financial system.This is a guest post by Kiara Taylor.

Recently, he became the first U.S. president to make a Bitcoin transaction when he bought cheeseburgers using the Bitcoin at New York's Bitcoin-friendly PubKey bar.The former president said at a recent event that crypto has ""got a great future"" and teased the possibility of using Bitcoin and crypto to pay off the nation's $35 trillion debt obligations.This aligns with Trump's previous positive statements about Bitcoin and crypto, as he courts the growing Bitcoin and crypto voter bloc. He has promised to make the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the world"" if elected again.Meanwhile, his opponent Kamala Harris made her first crypto-related pledge at a New York fundraiser. She stated her administration would ""encourage innovative technologies like A.I. and digital assets, while protecting our consumers and investors.""While Harris did not explicitly mention Bitcoin or crypto, the comment signals a positive stance as she vies for crypto-friendly voters. It contrasts with her previous silence on the issue.With both leading presidential candidates now openly discussing Bitcoin and crypto-related policies, it seems Bitcoin and crypto are entering the political mainstream."

These American-style options can be exercised at any time before the expiration date, providing flexibility for traders. According to the SEC, the listing will follow the same rules as options on other exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including position limits and margin requirements.""I'm assuming others will be approved in short order,"" said Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas. ""Huge win for the the bitcoin ETFs (as it will attract more liquidity which will in turn attract more big fish). This is nice surprise re timing but not a shocker as James Seyffart and I gave 70% odds of approval by end of May.""The SEC highlighted that this approval would allow investors to hedge their positions on Bitcoin, using the options market to mitigate the inherent volatility of BTC.

""As of May 22, 2023, IBIT had approximately 193,956 shareholders.""This approval by the SEC continues the trend of expanding regulated financial products based on Bitcoin, pushing it closer to full integration within the global financial system. The ability to trade options on a spot Bitcoin ETF provides new opportunities for institutional investors who wish to engage with the Bitcoin market while maintaining a higher level of risk management.""Important note: This is just one stage of approval, the OCC and CFTC has to approve as well before they officially list,"" Balchunas continued. ""The other two don't have a 'clock' so not sure when they'll be approved. A big step tho nonetheless that the SEC came around."""
Bitcoin Magazine,How Bitcoin Will React After The U.S. Election,"Fri, 20 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/how-bitcoin-will-react-after-the-u-s-election-,Can Historical Election Trends Predict Bitcoin’s Next Move?,"As the U.S. presidential election approaches, it’s worth examining how past elections have influenced Bitcoin’s price. Historically, the U.S. stock market has shown notable trends around election periods. Given Bitcoin’s correlation with equities and, most notably, the S&P 500, these trends could offer insights into what might happen next.S&P 500 CorrelationBitcoin and the S&P 500 have historically held a strong correlation, particularly during BTC’s bull cycles and periods of a risk-on sentiment throughout traditional markets. This could phenomenon could potentially come to an end as Bitcoin matures and ‘decouples’ from equities and it’s narrative as a speculative asset. However there’s no evidence yet that this is the case.  Figure 1: Bitcoin & The S&P 500 180-day correlation over the past five years. View Live Chart 🔍  Post Election OutperformanceThe S&P 500 has typically reacted positively following U.S. presidential elections. This pattern has been consistent over the past few decades, with the stock market often experiencing significant gains in the year following an election. In the S&P500 vs Bitcoin YoY Change chart we can see when elections occur (orange circles), and the price action of BTC (black line) and the S&P 500 (blue line) in the months that follow.  Figure 2: Bitcoin & The S&P 500 outsized returns in the year post-election. View Live Chart 🔍  2012 Election: In November 2012, the S&P 500 saw 11% year-on-year growth. A year later, this growth surged to around 32%, reflecting a strong post-election market rally.2016 Election: In November 2016, the S&P 500 was up by about 7% year-on-year. A year later, it had increased by approximately 22%, again showing a substantial post-election boost.2020 Election: The pattern continued in 2020. The S&P 500’s growth was around 17-18% in November 2020; by the following year, it had climbed to nearly 29%.A Recent Phenomenon?This isn’t limited to the previous three elections while Bitcoin existed. To get a larger data set, we can look at the previous four decades, or ten elections, of S&P 500 returns. Only one year had negative returns twelve months following election day (2000, as the dot-com bubble burst).  Figure 3: The S&P 500 has performed well following election day a majority of the time.  Historical data suggests that whether Republican or Democrat, the winning party doesn't significantly impact these positive market trends. Instead, the upward momentum is more about resolving uncertainty and boosting investor confidence.How Will Bitcoin React This TimeAs we approach the 2024 U.S. presidential election, it's tempting to speculate on Bitcoin's potential performance. If historical trends hold, we could see significant price increases. For example:If we experience the same percentage gains in the 365 days following the election as we did in 2012, Bitcoin's price could rise to $1,000,000 or more. If we experience the same as the 2016 election, we could climb to around $500,000, and something similar to 2020 could see a $250,000 BTC.It's interesting to note that each occurrence has resulted in returns decreasing by about 50% each time, so maybe $125,000 is a realistic target for November 2025, especially as that price and data align with the middle bands of the Rainbow Price Chart. It’s also worth noting that in all of those cycles, Bitcoin actually went on to experience even higher cycle peak gains!  Figure 4: Rainbow Price Chart aligning with post-election price target based on historical pattern. View Live Chart 🔍  ConclusionThe data suggests that the period after a U.S. presidential election is generally bullish for both the stock market and Bitcoin. With less than two months until the next election, Bitcoin investors may have reason to be optimistic about the months ahead.For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out a recent YouTube video here: Will The U.S. Election Be Bullish For Bitcoin?"

BTC is up nearly 6% since the Fed cut the US interest rate by 50 basis points. Yet, the report highlighted that Bitcoin’s current rally is driven primarily by futures trading rather than spot market activity, which raises concerns about potential volatility and correction. Derivatives-fueled rally Global open interest (OI) in Bitcoin futures has reached $19.43 billion, surpassing the Aug. 25 value of $18.93 billion, while the price remains about $1,000 below the local high. This suggests that the current price movement is led by perpetuals and futures trading, contrasting with the spot market-dominated rally earlier this month. Additionally, the spot market buying has slowed as the spot cumulative delta indicator flattened above $63,500. This development, coupled with increased futures activity, suggests the potential for a new lower timeframe range or partial correction. Although this can be seen as a bearish sign, Bitfinex analysts pointed out that OI does not indicate how much leverage derivatives traders are using. The high OI is likely driven by investors’ renewed interest in speculating on risk assets such as Bitcoin after the rate cut. Furthermore, altcoin speculation is also on the rise, with some tokens like SUI and AAVE seeing 100% gains since their August and September lows. However, altcoin open interest has also hit a higher high of $11.48 billion compared to the Aug. 19 peak of $10.74 billion. ETF flows suggest otherwise A counter-argument to potential consolidation is the renewed interest in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which saw $397.2 million in net inflows last week after a period of outflows from Aug. 24 to Sept. 6. The crypto market’s future direction may be influenced by broader market trends, particularly if the S&P 500 continues to rally beyond all-time highs and Bitcoin follows suit. The report highlighted that risk appetite for Bitcoin from traditional finance has manifested itself through spot ETF inflows, historically contributing to a strong correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500.

According to CryptoQuant data, the country’s significant presence in Bitcoin mining persists, but its dominance is now being challenged as other countries, such as the US, increase their share of hashrate. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju noted that US mining pools account for approximately 40% of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate. This share predominantly represents institutional miners, who leverage advanced technology and resources to maintain their competitive edge. In contrast, Chinese mining pools continue to support smaller players in the region, demonstrating resilience despite ongoing legal restrictions on crypto activities. China’s strict ban China’s current stance on crypto is among the strictest globally. The country first took action in 2017, banning Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and shutting down domestic exchanges. This move was followed by its 2021 ban on mining and trading. The crackdown aimed to curb the financial and environmental risks associated with digital assets. However, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin has allowed miners to find ways around the restrictions, maintaining China’s outsized influence over the global Bitcoin network. Additionally, underground crypto trading markets continue to thrive in the country via VPNs and social media platforms, with the latest estimates placing the annual volume of crypto transactions in China at roughly $86 billion. In parallel, the country has explored alternatives like the digital yuan, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) controlled by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC). The digital yuan is part of China’s broader strategy to maintain financial control while limiting the influence of decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Calls for change Meanwhile, industry leaders like Tron founder Justin Sun have urged China to rethink its policies on digital assets, particularly as the US positions itself as a global leader in crypto under former President Donald Trump’s pro-Bitcoin agenda. Sun argued that fostering competition between China and the US in crypto policy could drive significant advancements in the industry. Meanwhile, there are indications that China may be softening its stance on crypto, particularly with its growing interest in blockchain technology and potential regulatory changes. Recent reports suggest that China could consider revising its strict crypto regulations, especially in light of its actions in Hong Kong, which is positioning itself as a burgeoning crypto hub with implied support from Beijing. While the official stance remains stringent, these developments point to a possible shift in China’s regulatory approach toward cryptocurrencies in the future. However, concrete changes have yet to be announced. The post China persists as Bitcoin mining giant despite crypto ban – CryptoQuant appeared first on CryptoSlate. "

This influx boosted the total assets under management (AuM) for crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) by 9%, bringing the total to $85.8 billion. The overall investment product volume also increased to approximately $9.5 billion. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, linked this positive trend to the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points. He explained: “This surge was likely driven by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) comments last Wednesday, which took a more dovish stance than anticipated, including a 50 basis point interest rate cut.” Bitcoin, US dominate flows A breakdown of the flows showed that Bitcoin-based investment products led the inflows, generating $284 million in net gains globally last week. Notably, major crypto funds from firms like BlackRock, Bitwise, Fidelity, ProShares, and 21Shares contributed to this rebound, collectively adding $321 million in net inflows. The positive price momentum for Bitcoin also attracted investors with bearish sentiment, who allocated $5.1 million to short-Bitcoin funds. Ethereum faced its fifth consecutive week of outflows, totaling $29 million. This trend stems from ongoing withdrawals from Grayscale’s ETHE product and declining interest in new offerings. Crypto Assets Weekly Flow (Source: CoinShares) According to Farside data, ETHE experienced outflows between $13 million and $18 million for three straight days last week, overshadowing minor inflows from other products, including Grayscale’s Mini-Trust. Meanwhile, Solana maintained its current positive trend, adding $3.2 million in inflows last week. This flow can also be linked to the announcements of several traditional financial institutions announcing plans to launch financial services on the network during the latest Solana Breakpoint event in Singapore. Other large-cap altcoins, including XRP and Litecoin, saw combined inflows of $300,000. Across regions, the US unsurprisingly emerged as the leading contributor to last week’s inflow, accounting for $277 million, followed by Switzerland with $63 million. In contrast, Germany, Sweden, and Canada experienced outflows of $9.5 million, $7.8 million, and $2.3 million, respectively.

Bitcoin’s price over past cycles. Source: 10x Research. He noted improvements in the market structure, which could establish a solid foundation for a bullish trajectory. The rising supply of stablecoins indicates heightened liquidity, which can enhance trading activity—often a precursor to significant price rallies. Meanwhile, Elevated leverage levels in futures trading reflect a more speculative environment among traders, potentially driving prices upward. According to Coinglass data, open interest has surged to levels unseen since early August, topping $17.6 billion. Additionally, the release of $16 billion from FTX creditors between December 2024 and March 2025 is expected to bring more capital into the market. Thielen estimates that between $5 billion and $8 billion could re-enter the crypto space, further propelling Bitcoin’s ascent. Past Barriers to Bitcoin’s Price Flip to Catalysts As we enter Q4, past suppressants to the Bitcoin price are being lifted, contributing to a more favorable environment ripe for potential growth One of the main catalysts for Bitcoin’s recent rally is the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points. This move has shifted toward “risk-on” assets as investors seek opportunities amid a weakened U.S. dollar, rising inflation, and ongoing fiscal uncertainty. The stability of BTC miners post-halving has also contributed to the positive sentiment. Bitcoin halving events, which reduce the block reward for miners, often lead to a period of instability in the mining sector.  According to Blockchain.com data, following the April 2024 halving, the network’s hash rate has returned to pre-halving levels, signaling that the market has absorbed the impact. Additionally, major Bitcoin sell-offs appear to be over, providing a clear runway for further price appreciation. The German government and the Mt. Gox trustees have completed their sales, with $11 billion worth of Bitcoin priced in without any significant price disruptions. Kamala Harris Promises to Support Crypto Political developments have significantly bolstered sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with the upcoming US election emerging as a major catalyst for optimism.  Vice President Kamala Harris’s first public endorsement of digital assets has heightened this bullish outlook. Speaking at a Sunday fundraiser at Cipriani Wall Street in Manhattan, she affirmed a commitment to supporting crypto and AI to foster innovation.  We will partner together to invest in America’s competitiveness, to invest in America’s future. We will encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets, while protecting our consumers and investors.  This endorsement, along with Donald Trump’s open support for cryptocurrency, highlights a growing bipartisan backing that is expected to drive significant momentum in the cryptocurrency space as the push for regulatory clarity intensifies.

Bitcoin Magazine,CORVA: Want Greater Adoption Of Bitcoin? Use It To Fix Problems.,"Sat, 05 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/corva-want-greater-adoption-of-bitcoin-use-it-to-fix-problems,Follow the lead of Bitcoin Ekasi’s Hermann Vivier and Motiv’s Rich Swisher.,"     Follow Frank on X.  Bitcoin will not become more widely adopted as a result of intellectual curiosity or because it’s theoretically the best form of money ever. Instead, people will begin to use it because it solves pressing problems in their lives. So, if you’re looking to foster greater Bitcoin adoption, show someone how they can use Bitcoin to solve an issue their facing.Hermann Vivier, co-founder of Bitcoin Ekasi, a Bitcoin circular economy in South Africa was given this advice from Mike Peterson, Director of Bitcoin Beach, the world’s first Bitcoin circular economy, and it continues to inform his work.The broader problem that Bitcoin solves for underserved South Africans is that it provides them with a means to save in an environment in which many don’t trust banks or have much access to other investments. Part of the reason they don’t trust banks is because they’re often charged hidden fees from both the banks themselves as well as local merchants.Vivier told Bitcoin Magazine that many in the community often purchase goods via layaway programs (buy now, pay later) and are often duped by stipulations in the fine print of the deals.“You can go in and buy something today, not pay for it at all, take it home and then the merchant starts charging you after the second or the third month,” explained Vivier.“These credit schemes are quite exploitative. The fees would go up over time as interest accumulates and the residents give the company the right to just draw the money from their bank accounts, but the buyers don't understand what they're signing away,” he added. “After a year, they see there's still money going out of their account, but in their mind, they've already finished paying for this thing, yet they're still paying for it and they don't know why.”Vivier went on to explain that the simple fact that money cannot be automatically withdrawn from a Bitcoin wallet like it can from a bank account provides Bitcoin Ekasi community members with more of a sense of control over their funds.Rich Swisher, founder of Motiv, an NGO that develops Bitcoin circular economies and helps members of unbanked communities in Perú become more financially independent, also uses Bitcoin to help the financially disadvantaged have more control over their money.Swisher told Bitcoin Magazine that residents of the communities with whom Motiv works can’t save cash in their homes because of the high likelihood that they’ll be robbed. And many don't use banks because they charge fees that these residents can't afford to pay (That's if banking services are available at all.) Bitcoin provides them with a way to bank themselves, which serves as a financial base for them to start their own enterprises.“With Bitcoin, they can start a small business that they can run out of their home and run off of their phone,” Swisher told Bitcoin Magazine.“Over time they see that they can be financially independent. Then, they start seeing that not only do I have a good path going right now, but if it was all taken away from me tomorrow, I have the know-how to redo it,” he added.“None of this happens without Bitcoin.”So, does that mean you have to run out and start a full-on Bitcoin circular economy in an underserved community if you want to see more Bitcoin adoption? Absolutely not.But how hard would it be to show your friend who runs a non-profit how to accept bitcoin for international donations so to save on wire transfer fees or to show a family member how to send an international remittance using Bitcoin instead of Western Union, which charges high fees for its service? Not that hard.If you want to see more people using Bitcoin, quit the habit of explaining to those around you how great it is, and start showing them what problems it solves.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,The Positive End To 2024 For Bitcoin,"Fri, 04 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-positive-end-to-2024-for-bitcoin-,Optimism Ahead: Will Q4 2024 Deliver Bitcoin's Next Big Rally?,"As 2024 comes to a close, Bitcoin investors are eagerly eyeing the final quarter of the year, traditionally known for positive price action. With many speculating that a bullish rally may be on the horizon, let’s break down the historical data, analyze trends, and weigh the possibilities of what BTC’s price action might look like by the end of this year.Historical Performance of Bitcoin in Q4Looking at the past decade on the Monthly Returns Heatmap, Q4 has frequently delivered impressive gains for Bitcoin. Data shows that BTC often finishes the year strong, as evidenced by three consecutive green months in 2023. Not every year follows this trend however, 2021 and 2022 were less favorable, with Bitcoin ending the year on a more bearish note. Yet, years like 2020 and 2015 through to 2017 saw tremendous price surges, highlighting the potential for a bullish finish in Q4.  Figure 1: Q4 Performance has been historically strong for Bitcoin. View Live Chart 🔍  Analyzing Potential Q4 2024 Outcomes Based on Historical DataTo better understand potential outcomes for Q4 2024, we can compare previous Q4 performances with the current price action. This can give us an idea of how Bitcoin might behave if historical patterns continue. The range of potential outcomes is broad, from significant gains to minor losses, or even sideways price movement. The projection lines are rainbow color coded going from 2023 in red back to 2015 in a light violet shade.  Figure 2: Previous Q4 price action overlaid to today.  For example, in 2017 (purple line), Bitcoin experienced a significant increase, suggesting that in an optimistic scenario, Bitcoin could reach prices as high as $240,000 by the end of 2024.However, more conservative estimates are also possible. In a more moderate Q4, Bitcoin could range between $93,000 and $110,000, while in a bearish scenario, prices could drop as low as $34,000, as seen in 2018 (blue line).The median outcome based on this data seems to be around the $85,000 price point. Although this is based on the year end price from these projections, years such as 2021 (yellow line) resulted in considerably higher price before notable pullbacks to end the year.Is The Median Outcome A Possibility?Whilst an $85,000 in around three months time may seem optimistic, we only have to look back to February of this year to see a single month in which BTC experienced a 43.63% increase. We can also look to metrics such as The Golden Ratio Multiplier which are showing confluence around this level as a potential target with its 1.6x Accumulation High level.  Figure 3: Golden Ratio Multiplier 1.6x Accumulation High currently at ~$85,000. View Live Chart 🔍  Is $240,000 Even Possible?Whether Bitcoin can achieve such high values will depend on various factors. An increase in demand coupled with limited supply could propel Bitcoin to new all-time highs. Furthermore, developments such as Bitcoin ETFs, institutional investments, or major geopolitical events could further boost demand. We’re also seeing a similar pattern in this cycle as we have seen in the previous two, with a first wave of large scale market inflows before a cool-off period; potentially setting up a second rally in the near future.  Figure 4: Cycle Capital Flows showing a similar run-up and cool-off period to prior cycles. View Live Chart 🔍  This is probably over-ambitious, Bitcoin’s market cap has grown tremendously since 2017 and we’d require tens of billions of money pouring into the market. But Bitcoin is Bitcoin, and nothing is out of the question in this space!ConclusionUltimately, while historical data suggests optimism for Q4, predicting Bitcoin’s future is always speculative. A third of all of these projections resulted in sideways price action, with one forecasting a large scale decline. As always, it’s important for investors to remain unbiased and react to, rather than predict Bitcoin data and price action.For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out our recent YouTube video here:Bitcoin Q4 - A Positive End To 2024?"
Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine Introduces New Short Form Opinion Format: Takes,"Fri, 04 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/bitcoin-magazine-introduces-opinion-takes,The oldest and most trusted Bitcoin publication is introducing a new short-form content format.,"Every author has their own voice.At Bitcoin Magazine, we've long been advocates of elevating the voices from the Bitcoin community. As the premier publisher of Bitcoin opinion content, we continually amplify the various perspectives from across the industry, whether they're those of major CEOs or humble stackers.That said, the Bitcoin Magazine brand has often relied on a more unified (or classical) editorial voice in its publication. We're now taking steps to change that, by introducing a new article type called “Takes”.Takes are short articles about an idea, trend, blog post, person, company, product or proposal in the Bitcoin space, on which the authors give their (indeed) ""takes."" Compared to featured stories, Takes are more quickly written and opinionated. This means that Takes will offer a window into the thoughts and ideas of our authors, allowing readers to get an unfiltered glimpse of how they view Bitcoin and the world around it.Takes are published by the Bitcoin Magazine editorial team, but can also be written by anyone else who works at Bitcoin Magazine or its parent company BTC Inc. Occasionally outside contributors may contribute Takes as well.Of course, Bitcoin Magazine will continue to publish long-form features and contributed opinion pieces alongside Takes. Takes will continue to abide by our established policies for Layer 2 networks, as well as Bitcoin tokens, and be clearly labelled for reader understanding.We hope our Takes model will add to the discourse, and spur conversation as Bitcoin continues to advance and become widely used as the ultimate form of money."
Bitcoin Magazine,"No, You Won't Find Out Who Satoshi Nakamoto Is Next Week","Fri, 04 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/no-you-wont-find-out-who-satoshi-nakamoto-is-next-week,"As a longtime Bitcoiner, I'm certain this latest Satoshi Nakamoto unmasking attempt will disappoint just like the rest — with no real proof provided!","      As a longtime Bitcoiner, I had to roll my eyes when I saw HBO release a trailer for an upcoming documentary, teasing to reveal Satoshi's identity. Speculation arose that it would reveal who is Satoshi Nakamoto. After seeing many half-baked attempts to ""unmask"" Satoshi over the years, I'm certain this latest one won't provide definitive proof either.If you've been in Bitcoin long enough, you know the drill — someone claims they know or are Satoshi, theories start swirling, but no convincing evidence ever materializes. Inevitably it ends with embarrassment for the accuser. We've been through this rodeo too many times now.With Bitcoin becoming a $1.2 trillion asset class, the allure of outing Satoshi is understandable. His stash alone is supposedly 1.1 million BTC, worth over $65 billion currently. The usual suspects like Adam Back, Hal Finney or Nick Szabo will likely be resurrected as prime candidates. And the accused will again firmly deny the allegations. Our favorite Bitcoin historian, Pete Rizzo, already made $200 bets with Shinobi, Nikolaus, Frank, and I that Back ends up named and denies it.Yet ideally, Satoshi should remain anonymous as he clearly desired. Bitcoin succeeds on the merits of its decentralized design, not based on any single personality. Unmasking Satoshi risks undermining Bitcoin's mystique and independence.As Bitcoin grows into a global asset, the stakes around identifying its creator rise exponentially. The richest person on earth makes for an attractive bounty. But true proof remains elusive.These periodic media frenzies claiming to crack the case produce great hype yet always disappoint. They act as amateur sleuths following flawed hunches rather than impartial investigations seeking truth.So I advise fellow Bitcoiners to take next week's ""big reveal"" with a huge grain of salt. It will likely be more sensationalism than substance, repeating familiar theories that fall short of definitive evidence. The only person who can conclusively prove they are Satoshi is Satoshi himself. Until then, the mystery continues - as it should.This article is a Take. Opinions expressed are entirely the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine."
Bitcoin Magazine,AARON: Trump Does Not Give A Damn About Bitcoin,"Thu, 03 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/aaron-trump-does-not-give-a-damn-about-bitcoin,"Trump is providing lip service to Bitcoiners, but that does not mean he will continue to be an ally of Bitcoin if he does get elected for a second term.","     Follow Aaron on Nostr or X.  In his take from this Monday, Nikolaus argued that Donald Trump is heavily pro-Bitcoin. I beg to differ.Yes, Trump is providing lip service to Bitcoiners, which is more than we can say of Kamala Harris. The fact that he spoke at the Bitcoin conference is certainly interesting, and at least indicates that he’s aware of the “crypto voter” as a potential voting block. And yes, Trump did show up at PubKey, which was a fun little stunt— though he apparently wasn’t even able to make the payment himself.But it’s blatantly obvious he just wants your money and your vote. Of course, the same can be said for most politicians, but if anything, Trump is a more extreme example of this. He’ll basically scam you for it if he must, whether it’s through these ridiculous NFTs, or with whatever his new shitcoin project is supposed to be.I'm not at all convinced that Trump will continue to be an ally of Bitcoin if he does get elected for a second term. Even at Bitcoin 2024, his closing remarks —“have fun with your crypto, and Bitcoin, and all the other things you play with”— made clear he doesn’t actually care about Bitcoin in any real way. Indeed, just a few years ago, Trump said he was “not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air”.Right now, Trump needs your money and your vote— but he won’t need that anymore after he is elected. Even if you want to take seriously his blabberings like “miners get all the electricity they need for mining”, is there any reason to believe he won’t throw Bitcoin under the bus the moment that benefits him... most obviously, in favor of the dollar?Given Trump’s track record of broken campaign promises in his first term, I wouldn’t expect anything else.This article is a Take.

Last night, I had the distinct pleasure of having an in-depth conversation with Jeff Booth, who I often refer to as the Eckhart Tolle of Bitcoin.Booth, soft-spoken yet direct, harped on one point in particular in the conversation that, while at first I didn’t grasp, ended up resonating deeply with me.He said multiple times “We are Bitcoin” in efforts to drive home the point that Bitcoin will continue to work if we continue to make it work.At first this statement seemed antithetical to Bitcoin. Technically, of course, we’re not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an open-source protocol that allows people to transfer value securely and permissionlessly. Also, Bitcoin was designed in a way that actually requires less human involvement than the traditional monetary and financial systems, as its inflation rate can’t be altered by humans and there are no middle people involved in Bitcoin transactions.Yet we are Bitcoin, just as Booth said.We are the ones that have to spin up nodes to keep the network decentralized.We are the ones that plug in the miners to help power and secure the network.And we are the ones who educate others about Bitcoin as well as defend it in the social arena.We’re human nodes in the network, doing our part to technically keep Bitcoin running and propagating information about Bitcoin to the world.Without our taking responsibility as human nodes, Bitcoin becomes less decentralized, less secure and less understood.So, if you’re reading this, know that you are Bitcoin, a component of the most incredible system for human freedom and prosperity ever created, and both savor that and act accordingly.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Wall Street Isn't Bitcoin Only – More Crypto ETFs Are Coming,"Thu, 03 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/wall-street-not-bitcoin-maximalists-etf,"Wall Street wants to sell products that make U.S. dollars, and they will continue to do things that make dollars.","   Nothing stops this train.    No, I’m not talking about the Federal Reserve money printer, I’m talking about the string of ETF announcements from Wall Street and the related crypto firms servicing it this week.I’m talking about today’s hybrid Ethereum-Bitcoin ETF, yesterday’s XRP ETF, and what will likely be 2025’s basket memecoin ETF offering exposure to everything from PEPE to GIGA to HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu. If you’re takeaway from the arguably dismal ETH ETF launch is that there won’t be more crypto ETFs, I’m sorry but you’re looking past the $1 trillion price tag on the rest of the crypto industry.Wall Street wants to sell products that make U.S. dollars, and they will continue to do things that make dollars. OK, in a bear market, maybe that’s not an Ethereum ETF. But it’s hard to imagine that in a world where the U.S. regulatory environment continues to become “more advantageous to the industry,” and there aren’t 15 to 20 of these ETFs all pumping in a bull market. Maybe you’ve forgotten how in 2017 XRP pumped to $4 or DASH to $700, how in 2021, JPEGs sold for hundreds of millions. Newsflash: 80% of ETF purchasers are retail buyers, and that’s according to Blackrock.Maybe you think all our proselytizing to the likes of Rick Rubin has seeped somehow into the collective consciousness. Maybe you’re betting on Kamala Harris getting elected, and that she will continue to let Gary Gensler and the SEC run roughshod over crypto. Fair enough. That’s not a world I see. The Bitcoin-crypto voter constituency is here, and whether it delivers the election to Donald Trump, or it wins concessions from the Harris administration, that means more ETFs, not less. Certainly not a world where there’s only a Bitcoin ETF anytime soon.Again, Wall Street is not embracing the tao of Michael Saylor, they don’t see President Nayib Bukele as a developing world savant. They do not believe Bitcoin is a bulwark against money printing, and no it doesn’t matter that they are writing research reports to the effect. They will say whatever they can to sell ETFs, to make USD.Because they are not convicted buyers. They are convicted sellers. There’s a difference. This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,VIVEK: Bitcoin Lightning Payments Has a Long Way To Go In India,"Thu, 03 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/vivek-bitcoin-lightning-payments-has-a-long-way-to-go-in-india,I couldn't resist the lightning fast fiat payments network in India… ,"      As an Indian Bitcoiner returning home recently, I found myself using UPI digital payments repeatedly for everyday spending. UPI (Unified Payments Interface) is India's real-time bank-to-bank payment system that has become ubiquitous for making payments by scanning QR codes or using phone numbers. It's enabled even street vendors and tiny shops to accept payments online. Given the difficulty of getting cash change and vendors needing to keep the card machines, UPI is often the only payment option. And I have to admit; it's incredibly fast, cheap, and easy to pay merchants through UPI apps compared to fumbling with Bitcoin Lightning wallets, custodial or non-custodial. The money moves instantly for free, and the process is familiar to all parties.   While I'm huge on censorship-resistant, private, and decentralized money, Bitcoin and UPI's convenience are hard to ignore. UPI processes over 14 billion monthly transactions across over 450 banks with no fees. By comparison, Lightning is dealing with low liquidity, channel balancing headaches, and clunky user experiences (which keep improving with custodial wallets with some tradeoffs). Of course, the privacy implications of an almost fully digital system controlled by centralized third parties make me cringe and sound dystopian. But most Indians happily surrender privacy for convenience time and again.So, even as a Bitcoiner, I can't see most Indians ditching UPI to start using Bitcoin lightning en masse for day-to-day payments anytime soon, apart from Bitcoin circular economies. The incentive needs to be there. And let's be honest - Lightning still confuses Bitcoiners, let alone my uncle!Maybe down the road, privacy concerns or currency devaluation could drive Indians toward Bitcoin payments. But for now, UPI has too much momentum and network effect.This article is a Take. Opinions expressed are entirely the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine."
Bitcoin Magazine,OFF-CHAIN PROTOCOLS WILL ALWAYS BE A BALANCING ACT,"Wed, 02 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/shinobi-off-chain-protocols-will-always-be-a-balancing-act,Important things to consider when looking at the future of off-chain systems. ,"      Rene Pickhardt recently kicked off a thread discussing the differences between two party and multiparty (more than two participants) payment channels as it relates to his research work around payment reliability on the Lightning Network. He voices a growing skepticism of the viability of that direction for development. The high level idea of why channel factories improve the reliability of payments comes down to liquidity allocation. In a network of only two party channels, users have to make zero sum choices on where to allocate their liquidity. This has a systemic effect on the overall success rate of payments across the network, if people put their liquidity somewhere it isn’t needed to process payments instead of where it is, payments will fail as the liquidity in places people need is used up (until it is rebalanced). This dynamic is simply one of the design constraints of the Lightning Network known from the very beginning, and why research like Rene’s is incredibly important for making the protocol/network work in the long run. In a model of multiparty channels, users can allocate liquidity into large groups and simply “sub-allocate” it off-chain wherever it makes sense to in the moment. This means that even if a node operator has made a poor decision in which person to allocate liquidity to, as long as that person is in the same multiparty channel with people that would be a good peer, they can reallocate that poorly placed liquidity from one to the other off-chain without incurring on-chain costs. This works because the concept of a multiparty channel is essentially just everyone in the group stacking conventional two party channels on top of the multiparty one. By updating the multiparty channel at the root, the two party channels on top can be modified, opened, closed, etc. while staying off-chain. The problem Rene is raising is the cost of going on-chain when people don’t cooperate.The entire logic of Lightning is based around the idea that if your single channel counterparty stops cooperating or responding, you can simply submit transactions on chain to enforce control over your funds. When you have a multiparty channel, each “level” in the stack of channels adds more transactions that need to be submitted to the blockchain in order to enforce the current state, meaning that in a high fee environment multiparty channels will be more expensive than two party channels to enforce on-chain. These are core trade-offs to consider when looking at these systems compared to each other, but I think focusing exclusively on the on-chain footprint ignores the more important point regarding off-chain systems: they are all about incentivizing participants to not go on-chain. Properly structuring a multiparty channel, i.e. how you organize the channels stacked on top, can allow you to pack groups of people into subsections that have a reputation for high reliability, or who trust each other. This would allow people in these subgroups to still reorganize liquidity within that subgroup even if people outside of it are not responsive temporarily, or go offline due to technical issues. The on-chain cost of enforcing things, while important, is kind of tangential to the core design goal of an off-chain system: giving people a reason to stay off-chain and cooperate, and removing reasons for people to not cooperate and force things onc-chain. It’s important to not lose sight of that core design aspect of these systems when considering what their future will look like. This article is a Take.

As someone who had a public presence from writing their first article in Bitcoin back in 2013, I don’t have much of a choice – a lot of my personal information is out there, probably forever.That said, little improvements go a long way (or so they say). At least, they make me feel better about the fact that I’m guarding basically all my wealth with no one to hold accountable but myself these days… Anyway, one practical upgrade that I’ve made is to store my Bitcoin hardware devices and seed material in faraday bags, which repulse radiation and block frequencies. I’m not an expert, but I’ve been told this makes the devices harder to tamper with, and as far as additional steps, all you have to do is buy a specific storage bag.I got my first faraday bags for free with my Casa service (a multi-sig Bitcoin security provider that assists me with my self-custody). (They give out free faraday bags from this cool producer called SLNT for people who sign up, but I’ve bought a few more since then along the way.)That’s what turned me on to this privacy masterpiece. I’ve been in need of a new backpack, and I have to admit, despite the $1,000 price tag, the SLNT Submersible Faraday Backpack has my attention.SLNT Faraday Backpack (0:05) Not only does it look pretty sleek, but apparently it can keep your laptop (and any other devices) safe in up to 100 feet of water.As someone with a constant phobia of plane crashes, it’s tempting. Is this more than I need to protect my hardware devices in transit? Do I need to care about solar flares and EMF radiation? Maybe not, but given we may be on the cusp of World War III, that’s another reason to skip a stack and buy this right? I mean, it’s the kind of thing I should own as a “bitcoin expert?”I’ve asked Shinobi if he can make one out of Saran wrap, but alas, this is apparently beyond even his security acumen. Until then, I guess I’m stuck with this on my wishlist. Because there has to be a reason for me not to buy this right? This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,"Vivek: Unsurprisingly, The Bitcoin Price Follows Global Liquidity","Wed, 02 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/vivek-unsurprisingly-the-bitcoin-price-follows-global-liquidity,Bitcoin's sirens are ringing loudly that a liquidity-driven boom may soon be underway. ,"   What We're Reading: Bitcoin: A Global Liquidity Barometer   I have been intrigued by the significant increase in global liquidity during 2024, driven by extensive money printing and debt expansion, and how it impacts Bitcoin's price. Bitcoin is an expression against the government's monetary expansionist policies, so its price follows global liquidity, as seen here on this chart.It was fascinating to read the recent report by Lyn Alden and Sam Callahan analyzing Bitcoin's correlation to global liquidity. This further reconfirmed my view that more monetary expansion drives more people to Bitcoin, increasing prices. Their rigorous analysis found that over 12-month periods, Bitcoin's price moves in the same direction as global liquidity a remarkable 83% of the time. This is higher than any other major asset class, making Bitcoin a uniquely pure barometer for global liquidity trends.   The report quantified Bitcoin's correlation with global M2 money supply, finding a very strong 0.94 overall correlation between May 2013 and July 2024. Bitcoin's average 12-month rolling correlation was 0.51, while stocks and gold showed moderately high correlations as well in the 0.4 to 0.7 range.Of course, Bitcoin's correlation isn't perfect. Shorter-term breakdowns can occur around crypto-specific events like exchange hacks or Ponzi schemes collapsing.Supply-demand imbalances also cause temporary decoupling when Bitcoin reaches extreme overvaluation levels during market cycle peaks. Yet despite these breakdowns, the long-term relationship persists. Right now, liquidity is soaring to unprecedented levels, suggesting Bitcoin could soon embark on a massive bull run if this relationship holds. While I believe no model perfectly captures Bitcoin's complexity, recognizing its role as a monetary canary in the coal mine can lend valuable insight. If history rhymes, Bitcoin's sirens are ringing loudly that a liquidity-driven boom will soon be underway. This article is a Take.

Recently, there have been two charts in particular he has posted that have caught my eye.Nine months ago, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs for trading, and since then, the ETFs have seen huge inflows during eight out of those nine months. Since their inception, these ETFs have seen inflows of 312,488 BTC while miners have only created 169,942 new bitcoin.Number of Bitcoin purchased by 🇺🇸 #Bitcoin ETFs each month👇$IBIT $FBTC $GBTC $ARKB $BITB $HODL $BRRR $EZBC $BTCW pic.twitter.com/mpeurOCUcR— HODL15Capital 🇺🇸 (@HODL15Capital) October 1, 2024  These ETFs have been the fastest growing ETFs in history, like BlackRock CEO Larry Fink stated, with no real signs of slowing down, especially as we head into a period of time that has been historically bullish for Bitcoin. These ETFs are gobbling up all the available BTC leaving many thinking: Who could possibly be selling right now? And according to HODL15Capital, it appears to be smaller BTC holders, selling directly into the hands of the ETFs and institutions.🚨  Small Bitcoin holders continue to sell to ETFs and $MSTR 🤷‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/hV42fDVlps— HODL15Capital 🇺🇸 (@HODL15Capital) September 26, 2024  We're seeing state pension funds, large institutions, wealthy investors and other major players buy and hold shares of these ETFs. Even ETF issuers like BlackRock are buying shares of its own Bitcoin ETF for their other funds. Long story short, I'm seeing smart money pouring into this asset class and, while that is great for the price of BTC, it pains me to watch smaller holders sell their bitcoin directly to the institutions.Holding Bitcoin over the long term has been proven to be one of the best ways to build wealth. This is a real chance for those interested in investing for their future, who may not currently have proper savings, to start building up wealth in a sovereign way by accumulating BTC and holding the keys to their coins. Instead, these coins are being mostly ""locked up"" in these ETFs, where those who buy them can only redeem their shares for US dollars and don't experience the benefits of the attributes that make bitcoin so unique (e.g, freedom to transact globally without permission from a third party).Based on this data, I fear many of these smaller bitcoin holders are letting a great opportunity to build wealth via holding BTC slip through their fingers. Also, buy not buying bitcoin directly and holding it in self-custody, as opposed to purchasing shares of the ETFs, investors are missing out on what it truly means to own censorship resistant sovereign money. Such a feeling often has the effect of making investors hold bitcoin for the long-term as opposed selling in the short-term based on fear.The smart money knows exactly what opportunity is here, and they don't care too much about the freedom aspects of Bitcoin. They're just filling their BTC bags in a vehicle that suits them better. Cheap BTC does not last forever. Major players will continue scooping up huge swaths of shares of the ETFs as we hit a new all time highs and beyond. If there's one thing I leave you with today: Don't sell your BTC to the corporations, and hold the keys to your coins.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,"Lessons From Running Bitrefill, Premier Bitcoin E-Commerce Platform","Tue, 01 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/lessons-from-running-bitrefill-premier-bitcoin-e-commerce-platform,"10 years ago, Sergej Kotliar set out to help people more easily spend their bitcoin on everyday items, a task that still comes with a number of challenges and that has taught him many lessons.","Company Name: BitrefillFounders: Sergej Kotliar + othersDate Founded: 2014Number of Employees: 76Website: https://www.bitrefill.com/Public or Private? PrivateSince 2014, Bitrefill has been helping users spend their bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on everything from gift cards to mobile phone top ups to eSims.One might think that, after a decade, the company’s leadership has uncovered the secret to growing Bitrefill with relative ease. However, one of Bitrefill’s co-founders and its CEO, Sergej Kotliar, says that the company still faces a number of challenges in broadening its user base.“The main difficulty continuously in our company is finding customers,” Kotliar told Bitcoin Magazine.“It's difficult because it's still a niche. Especially people who use some kind of internet money in a wallet app on a regular basis is some small percentage or even a fractional percentage spread out across the world,” he added, referring to the less than 10% of the world’s population that owns crypto, and even fewer who use it regularly.“You need to figure out how to reach them.”While Kotliar and the team at Bitrefill may not yet have reached every potential customer out there, they’ve learned a lot about what to do and what not to do to keep a crypto company alive through multiple bitcoin epochs.In my conversation with Kotliar, he shared with me some of the lessons he’s learned.Lesson 1: Don’t Believe The HypeKotliar claims that one of the biggest illusions in the bitcoin and broader crypto space is that communities of crypto enthusiasts and users are bigger than they actually are. This becomes particularly dangerous when founders of crypto startups get lured into believing the hype on social media about their company.“There is definitely a phenomenon where a startup launches, they get cheers on Twitter, they very quickly sort of manage to convey their message and their value proposition to that audience who might be inclined to use their thing and are able to convert them — and then they hit the wall,” explained Kotliar.“The people that they acquired in that way are also very opinionated, which makes it difficult to go outside of that group. Companies get stuck because they become captured by their initial audience, which, in the best case scenario, are customers, but, in the mid scenario, are just fans — people on Twitter that don't really need whatever the company is offering,” he added.For this reason, Kotliar focuses less on what people have to say about Bitrefill on social media and more on providing the best possible customer experience.This includes constantly adding more items and services people can purchase with bitcoin and crypto via the site as well as developing new products like the Bitrefill Card, which lets users spend their crypto just like a traditional debit card lets users spend fiat.According to Kotliar, avoiding the crypto echo chamber and focusing on solving real problems for customers has been key to his company’s success.Lesson 2: Stay Alive — Without Requiring VC FundingBitrefill has survived for 10 years because it’s capable of standing on its own two feet financially, without requiring repeated doses of venture capital funding to remain afloat.“There are companies that are default dead, and there are companies that are default alive,” he explained.“This means if the current trajectory continues, is it going to be a dead company with no extra funding or is it going to be a live company? When you reach that ‘we're default alive’ point, it lets you focus more on the things that matter and less on the things that will attract investment,” he added.Kotliar went on to share that “things that attract investment in our industry often are not necessarily the things that require customers,” alluding to the fact that hype tends to drive investment in the crypto space more than a company meeting certain qualitative standards.Focusing on the things that matter, like helping customers easily spend their crypto on gift cards for almost anything as well as other services, has been essential in keeping Bitrefill in business for ten years, despite the inherent waves of volatility in the Bitcoin and crypto space.Lesson 3: Ride The Waves And Learn To SwimOne of the secrets to surviving as a Bitcoin or crypto company is learning how to keep a business afloat during market downturns. It’s easy for crypto companies to keep their doors open and even thrive when the bull market is in full swing, but only the strong survive when the bear market comes around.“During a bull market, we grow very rapidly, and during the bear market, we manage to stay flat,” Kotliar explained.“A lot of companies in our industry, in a bear market, will go under and fire people. We're not like that, but it definitely takes a lot of swimming to remain in the same place,” he added.The fact that Bitrefill serves customers in over 180 different countries also helps to keep it alive, as new waves of adoption happen in different countries at different times for a variety of different reasons.Kotliar says Bitrefill often experiences “regional waves” of adoption.“There's currently a wave going on in Argentina,” he said. “There is this 30% tax on foreign transactions, and so some Argentinians are using Bitrefill to buy games and stuff like that to avoid the 30% tax.”Lesson 4: Be Where The People Are (Or Where They Might Be)Despite the fact that Bitcoin and crypto have become more mainstream in the 10 years that Bitrefill has existed, Kotliar comes back to the point that to be successful as a company you have to aim to serve everyday people versus solely the Bitcoin enthusiast.“The world doesn’t care,” said Kotliar about Bitcoin ideology.“In the Bitcoin world, some parts of it care more about which features you don't offer as opposed to which features you do offer, which is strange. Nobody would go to a store and be like, ‘Hey, you also sell this stuff!’” said Kotliar, referring to the notion that some Bitcoin enthusiasts have taken issue with the fact that Bitrefill accepts other cryptocurrencies.Kotliar argues that users tend to be indifferent to what other technologies do and don’t offer, so long as they serve the purpose they need them to serve.“You seem to care about the Riverside [FM],” said Kotliar, referring to the app I used to record my interview with him, “but I don't know if you would go to a conference about it or get into an argument with someone over a feature that it has or maybe a feature that it should not have.”He went on to explain that Bitrefill accepts different cryptocurrencies for different reasons, one of which is meeting the consumer where it’s at, a core tenet of Kotliar’s approach. He shared that the core of Bitrefill’s strategy is getting the product in front of people who otherwise wouldn’t seek something like it out. He wants people to stumble upon it, which he claims “doesn’t always happen by itself.”“The big takeaway is that it's not enough to be at the Bitcoin conference,” he said. “You need to be in where people are, especially the people that do not particularly care about Bitcoin.”Lesson 5: Listen, Don’t SpeakSome of Bitrefill’s growth has been fueled by its being receptive to feedback from users.“We get a lot of feedback, and we have all kinds of channels open,” said Kotliar. “I think that the main function of marketing is actually to listen more than to speak.”Kotliar also noted that this process requires some discretion.“We try to listen in every channel, but then also try to figure out — to sift,” he explained, pointing out the company gets its fair share of messages from people pushing certain tokens.“[We] find out what the real requests are, and if you get enough real requests, you get a sense that this is real,” he added, referring to the suggestions that the company ends up taking seriously.What’s Next For Bitrefill?After 10 years, Bitrefill’s mission remains the same: focusing on what best serves customers (and ignoring the noise in the process).“We have a whole team now that's working on adding gift cards,” said Kotliar, “and we're still putting a lot of effort into the Bitrefill Card.”While Kotliar believes that Bitrefill is “the best in the world at everything Bitcoin payment related,” he and his team are currently looking into adding functionality for stablecoins on Lightning.Other than that, it’s business as usual at Bitrefill.“Our aim is to be the, you know, the one stop shop for everything day to day usage of cryptocurrency in the real world,” said Kotliar.“That's where we're putting our attention.”"
Bitcoin Magazine,RIZZO: SATOSHI NAKAMOTO'S NEW MYSTERY,"Tue, 01 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/satoshi-nakamoto-2009-bitcoin-mining-missing-blocks-mystery,It’s 2024 and there’s a new mystery surfacing around Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto – this time relating to his mining activity in 2009.,"WHO WE’RE FOLLOWING: Wicked BitcoinIt’s 2024 and there’s a new mystery surfacing around Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto.   In this case, discussion of a new enigma first surfaced on X, where everyone’s favorite ch-artist Wicked Bitcoin posted the discovery.Essentially, the finding boils down to this:It’s clear that Satoshi Nakamoto was an early Bitcoin miner – after all, he sent bitcoins to early contributors, and since he didn’t set himself up with a sweet “founder’s allocation,” they could have only come from mining.That said, we don’t really know how many bitcoins Satoshi mined. (He never commented on it publicly, aside from one reported instance where he claimed to ""own a lot"" of bitcoins.) Most of what’s “common knowledge” is from one study done in 2013, and while it’s become something like lore, there’s a lot of dispute about what it proves. Essentially, the study suggested Satoshi’s mining activity was visible on the blockchain via what’s been called the “Patoshi pattern.” Long story short, an early, very large miner changed the way they embedded data on the blockchain (via a non-standard iteration of the ExtraNonce), and most believe that this could have only been done by Nakamoto (who knew the most about the software in its infancy). Jameson Lopp (co-founder of Casa) built on this work in 2022. He added new analysis about this mystery miner, including the finding that they weren't seeking to maximize their profitability. Some felt this was another strong data point Patoshi was Satoshi.Now, Wicked is adding to the mystery, one that alludes to earlier “Patoshi” analyses. Essentially, by plotting this miner’s blocks on a date-time axis, he finds that there’s a notable gap in the timestamps of this miner’s blocks in early 2009.Of course, as to what we can conclude from this data, as Wicked’s comments section shows, that’s up for debate. Adding to the issue is that here is a dearth of historical information about Bitcoin from 2009. What’s been uncovered amounts to a few public email lists and private correspondences that have been published over the years (some forced by court hearings). As far back as May-June 2009, there were no Bitcoin forums, and it’s possible there could have been only a dozen people mining the network. Martii Malmi, (Satoshi’s first real righthand developer) would have only just been starting his work.This means that we don’t really have a concrete timeline or what occurred and why besides what’s visible by looking at the data, and there, there isn’t even that much to discuss – there were many days in 2009 where there weren’t any Bitcoin transactions. Wicked’s thesis here is that the above gaps show instances where the “Patoshi miner” went offline, and then had to restart operations. At this point, the miner was so powerful that they simply overwrote any blocks found by other miners in their absence.Wicked draws a few conclusions from this, going so far as to suggest Satoshi may have been testing how well the network held up to “51% attacks.” This would be plausible – after all, the idea that Bitcoin was robust enough to operate as long as a majority of participants were honest was his major contribution to digital cash as a concept. (Really, you could argue (as I have) that’s the only thing Satoshi brough to Bitcoin that was new, his primary skill taking hardened computer science concepts and stitching them together.)That said, there's a bit of a bearish read here. An accidental 51% attack would have still made honest mining moot, and this could be fodder for critics who like to paint Satoshi as the kind of errant experimenter we see on other chains today. Still, there’s a lot of conjecture here, and without more analysis (or more corroborating evidence) it’s hard to draw a firm conclusion. At any rate, we can marvel at the mystery that nearly 16 years later, Satoshi has succeeded so well in hiding his tracks from history. "
Bitcoin Magazine,Ocean’s DATUM Is Tackling Bitcoin’s Most Pressing Problem,"Mon, 30 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/aaron-oceans-datum-is-tackling-bitcoins-most-pressing-problem,"Ocean's DATUM is since this weekend putting transaction selection back into the hands of hashers, benefiting Bitcoin's censorship resistance.","   Since censorship resistance is arguably its core value proposition, I seriously doubt that Bitcoin would, in this scenario, have much long-term viability at all.It’s difficult to find a more fundamental threat to Bitcoin’s continued existence than mining centralization.    If —say— there are only a few mining pools, there is a very real possibility that these organizations face regulatory pressure of the kind that exchanges have also had to deal with: they could be forced to only include KYC’ed transactions into blocks. Since censorship resistance is arguably its core value proposition, I seriously doubt that Bitcoin would, in this scenario, have much long-term viability at all.To that end, it was great to see Ocean launch DATUM (Decentralized Alternative Templates for Universal Mining) this weekend. Similar to Stratum V2 (implemented by Demand Pool), DATUM allows miners (or: “hashers”) to select the transactions they include in the blocks they find, while still splitting the block reward with other users of the pool. In other words, hashers get the benefit of pooled mining, without having to outsource transaction selection to the Ocean pool operators, thus making it more difficult to enforce regulation. (It’s much easier to regulate a few big businesses —mining pools— in a handful of jurisdictions, than it is to regulate many smaller businesses and individuals —hashers— from around the world.)Of course, the adversarial mindset will recognize that this doesn’t in itself solve the problem of mining centralization in its entirety. Most obviously, draconian lawmakers could ultimately just ban this type of pooled mining altogether. Besides, it’s not really clear that there is a demand from hashers to construct their own blocks in the first place– though that might of course quickly change if and when there in fact is regulatory pressure that stops pools from including certain transactions in blocks. (And Ocean is providing an incentive for hashers to select their own transactions by cutting fees for those that make use of the new feature.)Either way, DATUM is an important step in the right direction. If nothing else, it should take away a lot of the concerns of Ocean themselves refusing to include certain “spam” transactions in their blocks: now every hasher can decide for themselves what transactions they do and do not want to include.The more difficult it is to thwart Bitcoin’s censorship resistance, the brighter Bitcoin’s future looks.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Inside Lebanon’s Currency Crisis: How Hyperinflation Feels,"Mon, 30 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/inside-lebanons-currency-crisis-how-hyperinflation-feels-,A look at the lived experience of going through hyperinflation in Lebanon.,"Lebanon is back in the headlines as the conflict in the Middle East intensifies. Before these latest developments, Lebanon had already become a symbol of how quickly a seemingly stable society can descend into chaos. If you follow major events in the global economy, you’ll probably recall that Lebanon’s recent past serves as a vivid example of what a full-blown currency collapse looks like in a modern, advanced economy. While there are some great books that describe hyperinflation in detached, academic terms, what’s often missing is the human story – what it’s actually like to be a normal, productive person with a family and a bank account, and to live through the collapse of your country’s currency.For a while now, I’ve known that my friend Tony Yazbeck, co-founder of The Bitcoin Way, had experienced this reality. But it wasn’t until I watched this interview with him that I realized how valuable his story is for everyone to hear. Tony’s story offers a rare, personal glimpse into what it means when your country’s banking system disintegrates, when you lose access to your savings, when food prices rise 10-fold in a few months, and when even basic necessities like medicine and fuel become luxuries. I asked Tony if he could explain not only why Lebanon collapsed, but also how bitcoin could have been a lifeline in such a dire situation.Lebanon: A country on the brinkBefore its economic collapse, Lebanon was a vibrant, cosmopolitan country, often called the ""Paris of the Middle East."" Its economy thrived on banking, tourism, and services, positioning it as a bridge between East and West. For Tony, this prosperity wasn’t an illusion—it was his daily life. ""My life in Lebanon was extraordinary,"" he recalls. ""I ran three thriving businesses and lived a luxurious lifestyle. Whether it was the latest cars, the best restaurants, or the hottest clubs, Beirut had it all.""Yet beneath the surface, cracks were forming. Lebanon’s banking sector, once a source of pride, was built on unsustainable practices, and the country was drowning in debt. For years, Lebanon’s central bank had pegged the Lebanese pound to the U.S. dollar at an artificially high rate, creating a false sense of stability. This currency peg required constant inflows of dollars to maintain. When those inflows dried up, the house of cards collapsed.In 2019, Lebanon’s banks began restricting access to savings, imposing informal capital controls without any legal framework. ""Overnight, people lost access to their funds,"" Tony says. ""You couldn’t withdraw your own money, and even if you could, it was in Lebanese pounds that were rapidly losing value."" For those unfamiliar with a currency crisis, the limitation of bank withdrawals is one of the first signs that the system is failing. The government and banks try to delay the inevitable by locking down money in the system. By then, it’s too late.From thriving businesses to $70 in handIn early 2020, Lebanon defaulted on its foreign debt, and the value of the Lebanese pound plummeted. Hyperinflation set in, destroying the purchasing power of ordinary people. Tony watched helplessly as his savings evaporated and his businesses crumbled. ""I went from being a successful entrepreneur to having just $70 to my name in what felt like the blink of an eye,"" he recalls. ""I couldn’t pay rent, school fees, or even afford basic groceries.""Hyperinflation took hold with shocking speed. ""A loaf of bread that once cost 1,500 LBP shot up to over 30,000 LBP within months,"" Tony explains. Fuel prices were even worse. ""In early 2023, a gallon of gas went from 25,000 LBP to over 500,000 LBP in just a few weeks. It was impossible to keep up with the prices.""The destruction wasn’t limited to material wealth; the psychological toll was immense. Tony describes the anxiety and panic that came with watching his hard-earned success disappear. ""For the first time in my life, I didn’t know what to do. I felt completely helpless.”.A fractured civil societyAs Lebanon’s currency collapsed, so did its social fabric. People who once lived comfortable, middle-class lives suddenly found themselves struggling for survival. Basic goods became scarce, and the price of everyday items skyrocketed. Power dynamics within communities shifted as those who controlled essentials like food and fuel gained disproportionate influence. ""There were reports of gangs taking over neighborhoods, controlling access to goods and demanding protection fees,"" Tony recalls.Even electricity became a luxury. With the national grid in shambles, most people had to rely on private generators, but the cost of running them was astronomical. ""Monthly generator fees jumped from 200,000 LBP to over 4,000,000 LBP,"" Tony explains. Many families were forced to live without power for long stretches of time.In response to the crisis, people turned to alternative forms of exchange. Bartering became common, with people trading goods and services directly. ""If you couldn’t pay in cash, you might offer plumbing work in exchange for groceries,"" Tony says. The U.S. dollar, already widely used before the collapse, became the default currency for many transactions. Digital currencies, and especially stable coins like Tether (USDT), also gained traction as people sought ways to preserve value outside the collapsing banking system.What could have been: Bitcoin as a lifelineAs Tony recounts the collapse, questions loom large: Could this have been prevented? Or at the very least, could individuals have somehow protected themselves better? For Tony, the answer is clear: Yes – with access to bitcoin, many of the worst effects of the crisis might have been avoided.""If I had known about bitcoin before the crisis, it could have saved me,"" Tony says without hesitation. ""Bitcoin would have given me a way to store value outside the banking system, which completely failed. I wouldn’t have been locked out of my own savings, and I could have preserved my wealth as the Lebanese pound collapsed.""Bitcoin is immune to the kind of capital controls Lebanon’s banks imposed in 2019. No government or bank can freeze your bitcoin or restrict access to it. In a country where the banking system became a trap, bitcoin would have provided a way out.Even as Lebanon’s currency lost over 90% of its value, bitcoin held its purchasing power globally. ""Bitcoin isn’t tied to any government or central bank, so it can’t be manipulated the way the Lebanese pound was,"" Tony explains. ""It’s a hedge against hyperinflation, which would have been critical when prices were doubling and tripling every few months.""Bitcoin’s status as a digital bearer asset would have been equally important. ""When cash becomes worthless and banks stop functioning, how do you pay for things? How do you trade?"" Tony asks. In Lebanon, bartering and informal exchanges became necessary for survival. In many situations, bitcoin may have served as a viable alternative to barter, worthless Lebanese pounds, and U.S. dollars that were difficult to obtain.Lessons for the worldLebanon’s crisis offers a stark warning to the rest of the world. While many people in developed countries believe that their economies are too stable to collapse in such a way, Tony’s experience should give us pause. ""What happened to me could happen anywhere,"" he warns. ""Don’t think you’re immune just because you live in a so-called stable country. The mechanics of fiat currency are the same everywhere.""Tony points to the U.S. as an example of a country that is walking the same dangerous path as Lebanon. ""The U.S. national debt now exceeds $35 trillion. Since 1971, when the dollar was taken off the gold standard, the money supply has increased by over 8,000%. That kind of money printing can’t go on forever.""While the U.S. benefits from being the issuer of the world’s reserve currency, that status isn’t guaranteed indefinitely. ""All fiat currencies are headed to zero eventually,"" Tony cautions. ""Some will fail sooner than others, but they will all fail. The U.S. dollar might be the last to go, but its turn is coming.""The lessons from Lebanon’s collapse are clear: Protect your wealth before a crisis hits, and don’t assume that your government or banking system will be there to save you when things go south. For Tony, that means turning to bitcoin. ""Bitcoin is the only asset that’s truly un-confiscatable,"" he says. ""It’s the only way to escape a broken system.""A new mission to rebuild with bitcoinIn the aftermath of Lebanon’s collapse, Tony has dedicated his life to helping others avoid the same fate. He founded The Bitcoin Way, a bitcoin education and technical services business designed to teach people how to use bitcoin to protect themselves from currency crises. ""The crisis forced me to study and understand money,"" Tony says. ""I realized that the fiat system is a scam, designed by thieves to steal and control us. Bitcoin is the solution.""Every day, Tony educates his clients about how to take control of their financial future using bitcoin. ""Once you understand how bitcoin works, you see the flaws in traditional fiat systems,"" Tony explains. ""You learn how to manage your assets securely, make transactions independently of banks, and protect your wealth from inflation and economic instability.""The road aheadTony believes that the collapse of the Lebanese pound was avoidable, but that would have required structural reforms that never came. ""If Lebanon had tackled corruption, maintained transparency, and adjusted the currency peg responsibly, things might have turned out differently,"" he says.But given the deep-rooted corruption in Lebanon’s political and financial systems, the collapse was almost inevitable.As Tony reflects on his experience, he sees parallels between pre-crisis Lebanon and the current state of many developed economies. ""We’re seeing the same issues – rising debt, unsustainable monetary policies, and corrupt institutions,"" he says. The warning signs are there, but many people ignore them, believing that their country is somehow different.For those who are paying attention, Tony offers practical advice. ""Start educating yourself about bitcoin now, before it’s too late,"" he urges. ""Diversify your assets and don’t rely on fiat currency to preserve your wealth. The mechanics of hyperinflation don’t change just because you live in a wealthy country.""Lebanon’s collapse is not just a cautionary tale for people living in developing economies. It’s a wake-up call for the entire world. As governments continue to print money at unprecedented rates, the risk of a global currency crisis grows. Bitcoin offers a way out – an inflation-proof alternative that can protect the wealth of individuals when fiat currencies fail.Tony’s experience is a stark reminder of the fragility of fiat systems and the importance of financial sovereignty. ""With bitcoin in your custody, you have the power to protect yourself from corruption, manipulation, and inflation,"" Tony says.""You don’t need permission from a bank or a government to manage your own money. And that’s exactly what makes bitcoin the ultimate tool for financial freedom.""This is a guest post by Dave Birnbaum.

Bitcoin Magazine,"NIKOLAUS: Business Insider Says Trump And Harris Both Courting The Bitcoin Vote, But Reality Says Otherwise","Mon, 30 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/nikolaus-business-insider-says-trump-and-harris-both-courting-the-bitcoin-vote-but-reality-says-otherwise,"Kamala Harris has done nothing to confirm she will support or protect the industry so far, while her political opponent is going above and beyond for it.","     Follow Nikolaus on X  Business Insider published a new report today on where Bitcoin currently stands in regards to the upcoming U.S. presidential election, with exactly what you would expect from a left leaning mainstream media outlet. The article states that “Trump and Harris have different reasons to try to attract the crypto community”, and while I agree it is true that it would be good for both candidates to win over this vote, only one of them has actually put in the work to do so. The article begins by noting how Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency at large, is not at the top of the list of priorities for most voters nationwide, which I actually believe to be true. Earlier this summer I got the opportunity to attend the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and even there after everything Trump had said about supporting this industry, there was no broader discussion going on about it amongst anyone there really. There was also no discussion on it at the Democratic National Convention (DNC). Most voters do care about more prominent issues such as the illegal immigration problem, inflation, crime, and more. But I think this does appear to be changing, in more ways than they may think.Business Insider continues the typical mainstream media narrative that this industry is just a bunch of “crypto bros” and how “maybe” the vote of a “dogecoin-loving guy” in a swing state might be important in deciding the upcoming election. They then flip flop and joke about just because someone might own $50 worth of Bitcoin, that it won’t play a factor in them deciding on who to vote for in this upcoming election. But they fail to recognize two important factors that negate their jabs at the industry.Bitcoin has officially crossed the chasm and is now backed by traditional financial institutions, including BlackRock, Fidelity, etc. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager, and they’re not here to play around like the “crypto bros” Business Insider suggests. They’re here to make money, and their spot Bitcoin ETFs have been the fastest growing ETFs in history. The customers of their ETFs range from all different classes of investors, who also want to see this asset class soar. These large asset managers are amassing an army of new Bitcoin holders who come from traditional financial backgrounds, and I’m sure will want to make their voices heard this November.Also, earlier this year, CNBC reported that half of Americans have $500 or less in their savings account, and 60% have $500 or less in their checking accounts. Americans have a savings problem, as CNBC noted, “The lack of cash in either savings or checking accounts suggests that many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.” Everyone has to start saving from somewhere, and those with $50 worth of BTC will vote for who will advance their best interests, like building up their financial savings. So holders of BTC should not be written off because of the amount of BTC they may own when it comes to voting. So far, only Donald Trump has put in the effort to appeal to this group of voters. Former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had also pledged to support the Bitcoin industry, but he dropped out to support Trump. Trump has gone above and beyond to earn the support of the Bitcoin and broader crypto industry, including speaking at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville earlier this summer, promising to help BTC miners get all the electricity they need for mining, promising to build a strategic stockpile of BTC for the country’s reserves, and so much more.Meanwhile, Kamala Harris has said literally nothing on the Bitcoin industry let alone support it. She declined to speak at the same Bitcoin conference in Nashville this past summer, and has not added Bitcoin into the Democratic party platform like the Republicans did. She has attacked the Bitcoin industry non-stop since getting into office with Joe Biden almost four years ago. Business Insider touches on her lack of comments on Bitcoin, but attempts to frame it in a more bi-partisan way, as if she is going to support the industry in a similar fashion as to Trump.And this is where I disagree with many when it comes to this issue. I believe Bitcoin is 100% a partisan issue in this country. I watch all the senate and congressional hearings when it comes to Bitcoin related topics, and witness how the majority of Republicans vote in favor of Bitcoin, while the majority of Democrats vote against it. Democrats vote in favor of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) while most Republicans vote against CBDC. There is a clear dividing line, being further proven by Trump being heavily pro-Bitcoin and Kamala being reluctant to support the industry.If Kamala wanted to support the industry, she would have taken the time to do so by now. She has yet to even say the word Bitcoin publicly. She did say she would support “blockchain” in a recent speech, but based on her previous years of hostility, and the general directions Democrats vote, one can only assume she means CBDC and not supporting Bitcoin. A few times over the course of the last few months, Harris’ campaign has hinted at potentially supporting the industry, but has not acted on it in any way, leaving more empty promises.Which leaves me to believe that if she wanted to support this industry, she would have by now — no excuses. Trump went to PubKey, a Bitcoin themed bar in NYC, purchasing almost $1,000 worth of burgers and drinks for everyone there using the Bitcoin Lightning Network, just a couple days after an assassination attempt on him. If Trump can do that, and Kamala can’t even get in front of a microphone and camera and say the word Bitcoin, then it is clear what their stances on the matter are.After explaining all of Kamala’s shortcomings in supporting the Bitcoin industry, Business Insider ends the article by stating that “What Harris or Trump will actually do on crypto is unclear, but that's not really the point right now.” This is pure gas lighting, considering Trump has put forth clear policies on the matter, while Kamala has not. And since she underperformed him in attempting to win over this vote, they try to pivot to suggest 'oh that’s not really the point right now, that’s not what matters'. But it is what matters. It is reported that there are over 50 million people in the U.S. who own Bitcoin and crypto, they are spread out all across the country, and want their interests advanced this November. While Bitcoin is not near the top of the list of priorities for the average American, it is for those interested in this asset class. This ever growing voter bloc is dedicated to their cause and they are not willing to budge on the issue. So far, only Trump has taken the effort to support and get involved in this industry, while Kamala seems like she couldn’t care less about it."
Bitcoin Magazine,Maximizing Bitcoin Gains with ETF Data,"Fri, 27 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/maximizing-bitcoin-gains-with-etf-data-,Outperforming Bitcoin: A Simple ETF Data Strategy for Higher Returns 🚀,"Maximizing Bitcoin Gains with ETF DataSince the introduction of Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in early 2024, Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs, with multiple months of double-digit gains. However, as impressive as this performance is, there's a way to significantly outperform Bitcoin's returns by utilizing ETF data to guide your trading decisions.Bitcoin ETFs and Their InfluenceBitcoin ETFs, launched in January 2024, have quickly amassed large amounts of Bitcoin. These ETFs, tracked by various funds, allow institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning it. These ETFs have accumulated billions of USD worth of BTC, and tracking this cumulative flow is essential for monitoring institutional activity in Bitcoin markets, helping us gauge whether institutional players are buying or selling.  Figure 1: BTC ETF Cumulative Flows (USD) have surpassed $18.5b. View Live Chart 🔍  ETF daily inflows denominated in BTC indicate that large-scale investors are accumulating Bitcoin, while daily outflows suggest they are exiting positions during that trading period. For those looking to outperform Bitcoin's already strong 2024 performance, this ETF data offers a strategic entry and exit point for Bitcoin trades.  Figure 2: BTC ETF Daily Flows (BTC) show regular accumulation of over 10,000 BTC per day. View Live Chart 🔍  A Simple Strategy Based on ETF DataThe strategy is relatively straightforward: buy Bitcoin when ETF inflows are positive (green bars) and sell when outflows occur (red bars). Surprisingly, this method allows you to outperform even during Bitcoin's bullish periods.This strategy, while simple, has consistently outperformed the broader Bitcoin market by capturing price momentum at the right moments and avoiding potential downturns by following institutional trends.  Figure 3: Each trade following this institutional inflow/outflow strategy.  The Power of CompoundingThe real secret to this strategy lies in compounding. Compounding gains over time significantly boosts your returns, even during periods of consolidation or minor volatility. Imagine starting with $100 in capital. If your first trade yields a 10% return, you now have $110. On the next trade, another 10% gain on $110 brings your total to $121. Compounding these gains over time, even modest wins, accumulate into significant profits. Losses are inevitable, but compounding wins far outweigh the occasional dip.Since the launch of the Bitcoin ETFs, this strategy has provided over 100% returns during a period in which just holding BTC has returned roughly 37%, or even compared to buying Bitcoin on the ETF launch day and selling at the exact all-time high, which would have returned approximately 59%.  Figure 4: Over 100% compounded gains since ETF launch following this strategy.  Can Further Upside Be Expected?Recently, we’ve begun to see a sustained trend of positive ETF inflows, suggesting that institutions are once again heavily accumulating Bitcoin. Since September 19th, every day has seen positive inflows, which, as we can see, have often preceded price rallies. BlackRock and their IBIT ETF alone have accumulated over 379,000 BTC since inception.  Figure 5: BlackRock alone has accumulated over 379,000 BTC in just a few months. View Live Chart 🔍  ConclusionMarket conditions can change, and there will inevitably be periods of volatility. However, the consistent historical correlation between ETF inflows and Bitcoin price increases makes this a valuable tool for those looking to maximize their Bitcoin gains. If you’re looking for a low-effort, set-it-and-forget-it approach, buy-and-hold may still be suitable. However, if you want to try and actively increase your returns by leveraging institutional data, tracking Bitcoin ETF inflows and outflows could be a game-changer.For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out a recent YouTube video here: Using ETF Data to Outperform Bitcoin [Must Watch]"
Bitcoin Magazine,Tornado Cash Loses Motion to Dismiss,"Fri, 27 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/tornado-cash-loses-motion-to-dismiss,A short summary of the recent decision regarding the Tornado Cash case.,"The judge in the Tornado Cash case delivered an oral ruling today, rejecting both the Defense’s motion to compel discovery and their motion to dismiss the charges. This represents a massive setback for the Defense, and the judge’s reasoning may not bode well for developers and projects going forward.Motion to CompelThe Defense's motion to compel discovery sought to access a broad range of government communications, including exchanges with foreign authorities under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) and with domestic agencies like the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Citing Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16, the Defense argued that these materials were essential to understanding the government's case and could potentially include exculpatory evidence. The judge, however, made it clear that Rule 16 imposes a stringent requirement: the Defense must show that the requested information is material to their case, not merely speculate on its potential usefulness.The court dismissed the Defense’s arguments as speculative, noting that references to what the information ""might"" or ""could"" reveal do not meet the necessary standard for materiality. For example, the Defense argued that MLAT communications with the Dutch government might shed light on the evidence against Tornado Cash or reveal the government’s investigative theories. The judge found this reasoning unpersuasive, emphasizing that materiality cannot be established through conjecture or vague assertions.The court similarly rejected the Defense’s request for all communications between the government and OFAC and FinCEN. Although the Defense claimed these documents were necessary to understand the government's theories and potential witnesses, the judge concluded that the Defense failed to demonstrate how these communications were directly relevant to the charges at hand. The court reiterated that the burden is on the Defense to show a specific link between the requested documents and their defense strategy, a burden they did not meet.When the Defense suggested an in-camera review—a private examination by the judge of the requested documents—to determine their materiality, the court refused. The judge argued that granting such a request based on speculative assertions would set a dangerous precedent, effectively forcing in-camera reviews in all criminal cases when a defendant speculates about the relevance of certain documents. This, the judge stressed, would undermine the purpose of Rule 16 and transform the pretrial discovery process into an unrestrained search for potentially helpful evidence.The Defense also raised concerns under Brady v. Maryland, arguing that the government might be withholding exculpatory or impeachable evidence. While the court acknowledged the government's obligations under Brady, it found no indication that these duties had been neglected. Without concrete evidence suggesting the government was withholding information, the court saw no reason to compel additional disclosures. The judge cautioned that while the Defense’s arguments were theoretically possible, they lacked the factual support needed to warrant the court’s intervention. She did say, however, that if she later finds that the government has “interpreted its obligations too narrowly” then there will be “unfortunate consequences for their case.”Motion to DismissThe motion to dismiss presented a much more significant set of issues. Central to the Defense's argument was the definition of a ""money transmitter"" under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). The Defense contended that Tornado Cash did not qualify as a money transmitter because it did not exercise control over users’ funds; it merely facilitated the movement of cryptocurrencies. The court, however, rejected this narrow interpretation. The judge clarified that the BSA's scope does not require the control of the funds; Tornado Cash’s role in facilitating, anonymizing, and transferring cryptocurrency was sufficient to bring it within the statute’s ambit. The judge likened Tornado Cash to custodial mixers, which have been deemed money transmitting businesses.Further complicating the Defense's argument was their reliance on the 2019 FinCEN guidance, which uses a four-factor test to determine whether a wallet provider is a money transmitter. The Defense claimed this guidance, which includes a “total independent control” standard, should apply to Tornado Cash. The court disagreed, stating that this standard is specific to wallet providers and does not extend to mixers like Tornado Cash. Consequently, Tornado Cash’s lack of “total independent control” over funds was irrelevant to its classification as a money transmitter.Another key point in the court’s analysis was the distinction between expressive and functional code under the First Amendment. The Defense argued that prosecuting Storm for his involvement with Tornado Cash was tantamount to punishing him for writing code, which they claimed was protected speech. The judge acknowledged that while code can be considered expressive, the specific use of code to facilitate illegal activities—such as money laundering or sanctions evasion—falls outside the bounds of First Amendment protection. The judge emphasized that the court must focus on the conduct enabled by the code, not merely the code itself. Even under intermediate scrutiny, which applies to content-neutral restrictions on speech, the judge found that the government’s interests in preventing money laundering and regulating unlicensed money transmission justified the restrictions imposed by the relevant statutes.The court also addressed concerns about the immutability of Tornado Cash’s smart contracts, an issue raised by both parties. The judge acknowledged the existence of a factual dispute but noted that it was not a decisive factor in the current motion. However, the issue of immutability may play a role at trial in determining the extent of Storm’s control over the service and his responsibility for its operations.In concluding remarks, the judge underscored that while the use of code to communicate ideas may be protected under the First Amendment, using that code to facilitate illegal activities is not. This distinction is critical in the context of emerging technologies like blockchain, where the line between speech and conduct can be blurred. The court’s ruling serves as a reminder that the legal system is prepared to hold participants in the digital economy accountable, even as it grapples with the complexities of applying traditional legal principles to new and evolving technologies.The full transcript of the ruling will be released once prepared by the court reporter.This is a guest post by Colin Crossman.

Bitcoin Magazine,"Proof of Reserves: Show Me the Money, Or It Didn’t Happen ","Thu, 26 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/proof-of-reserves-show-me-the-money-or-it-didnt-happen-,Why Proof of Reserves is a critical piece of infrastructure for any custodial services built on top of Bitcoin. ,"If we claim to be an improvement on traditional finance, we had better start playing the part. It’s clear how Bitcoin fixes rampant monetary discretion. It’s clear, too, how Bitcoin changes your relationship with money—both financially because you’re more inclined to save an appreciating asset—as well as physically because you can do novel things like hold the GDP of a small island nation on a USB. There is one thing, however, that is slowly gaining acceptance and needs to be accepted if we are to truly improve on the mistakes of the past, and that’s Proof of Reserves. Bitcoin has unique audit properties baked into the system itself. Bitcoin allows any third party to audit the entire money supply down to the smallest unit. A third party can do this for free, without any special privileges or permissions. It’s difficult to overestimate how novel and consequential this property of the Bitcoin protocol is and the implications of the guarantees it provides. For context, the total global supply of dollars is an estimate and not an exact number by any stretch of the imagination due to a variety of factors including the existence of physical and digital cash, as well as currency circulation abroad. The total number of gold in existence is also an estimate due to entirely different reasons mainly the lack of certainty when it comes to the volume of mined gold from different mines around the world, gold existing in private hands, gold hoards and stashes, new mining, recycling, and unreported sources. There is no global, trustless, source of truth for any money or commodity other than Bitcoin. And this should be Bitcoin’s driving force moving forward.Proof of Reserves (PoR) has been an important part of the industry since near-inception. The infamous Mt. Gox collapse of 2014 set the stage for much needed transparency. The exchange was hacked, 850,000 BTC (~47,617,204,000 USD at the time of this article) were stolen and their customers were unaware. The funds were drained over the course of a few years before the actual collapse happened. A PoR system would have mitigated further loss of funds as their customers would have seen the exchange's reserves depleting at an alarming rate. If this sounds more like recent memory than an ancient piece of Bitcoin history it’s because the same argument applies to FTX, and the same basic thing happened to FTX. If customers, and the wider market at-large, would have seen the exchanges BTC reserves depleting in real-time (or the fact that FTX had zero Bitcoin), systemic-risk would have been dramatically mitigated.So, what do you think would happen if the single custodian holding 90% of the spot Bitcoin backing these ETF’s were hacked or and/or acted maliciously? Unless the public is notified by the exchange, millions of people would be holding billions of paper Bitcoin. The more we connect ourselves to traditional finance the more cross-risk there is between traditional financial markets and the crypto markets. There are two choices at this point as we continue to mature as an asset class- apply old security and risk management tools to this new technology, or apply new, more performant, standards that are risk-adjusted to ensure we don’t see a systemic collapse if a certain class of financial products experiences a shock.The claim can be made that having auditors is sufficient, that we already have these tools in place and as regulated financial products, this is essentially already “taken care of.” This claim, itself, is valid as imposing audit controls to mitigate risk is, in fact, the best we’ve been able to do thus far as it relates to financial products. But any meaningful investigation into the function of auditors yields alarming results: PwC vs. BDO in the Colonial Bank Case (2017), Grant Thornton vs. PwC (Parmalat Scandal, 2003), BDO vs. Ernst & Young (Banco Espírito Santo, 2014), KPMG vs. Deloitte (Steinhoff Scandal, 2017), and this is only looking back 20 years. FTX and Enron both had auditors. We use auditors because we don’t trust the individuals running the organization and the best we’ve been able to do to date is defer trust over to a different set of people, outside the organization. But the inherent risk of trusting people and organizations has never been remediated until now. Enron’s biblical collapse was due to clear conflict of interests between them and their auditor—namely that Arthur Andersen was also providing lucrative consulting services to Enron in addition to their audit function and by extension helped them cook their books. Bitcoin is different, it behaves and lives differently. It behaves differently because the cryptographic guarantees it exhibits is something incomparable to traditional assets. Just as anyone can audit the entire money supply in the system with trustless guarantees, so too can anyone audit the personal holdings of an individual, or corporation, or ETF, holding Bitcoin in a completely risk-less way. It’s an important note, that it is not risk-mitigated, but risk-less. Someone cryptographically proving to any other counterparty that they own Bitcoin for, say, a loan can do so with no question as to whether the person is the actual owner of the BTC. This can happen repeatedly, with little overhead, and can be monitored continuously in real-time. There is no titling, there is no external auditor, there is no reviewing of any books that needs to take place. That data can be ingested without question.So, what does this mean for ETF products? It should be clear at this point that because ETF products are such a critical pillar of our modern financial system and because Bitcoin introduces unique risk paradigms that old audit standards are inadequately servicing, that new risk infrastructure needs to be applied to these products. The solution is simple and it is the same solution that has been crackling its way up through the ice we’re all standing on in an attempt to get some air. Require spot Bitcoin ETF products to implement and comply with Proof of Reserves regimes. They should be giving their investors the peace of mind that the underlying asset backing these ETF’s exists, that they are sitting in robust custody setups and are not being rehypothecated. A failure to do so, or an unwillingness to do so on the part of the ETF issuer speaks to the priorities of the issuer—namely that they either don’t understand the nature of this particular financial product or that they are more comfortable operating with opacity than transparency. A failure to implement this as a standard industry-wide is simply a ticking time-bomb.Hoseki was created for this very purpose, to build the plumbing that makes financializing Bitcoin a reality starting with PoR. Hoseki helps individuals prove their reserves to counterparties through Hoseki Connect and through Hoseki Verified provides services to private and public corporates, and ETF issuers so they can publicly verify their Bitcoin holdings building better brands, redefining trust, and mitigating risk for a healthier and more robust financial ecosystem.

Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Swap Service Boltz Launches BTCPay Server Plugin For Lightning Payments,"Thu, 26 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-swap-service-boltz-launches-btcpay-server-plugin-for-lightning-payments,The Boltz BTCPay Plugin enables merchants using BTCPay Server to accept Lightning payments non-custodially and transfer these funds to the Liquid sidechain.,"Today, Boltz announced the launch of the Boltz BTCPay Plugin, the first feature of its kind, in open beta. The plugin lets merchants who use BTCPay Server easily accept bitcoin over Lightning before having it automatically swapped and stored non-custodially on the Liquid Network.The “Nodeless” mode for the Boltz BTCPay Plugin utilizes Liquid Swaps to make the automatic swap from Lightning to Liquid the instant a Lightning invoice is paid. Using Liquid Swaps, Boltz BTCPay Plugin users can also swap bitcoin back to the mainchain if they prefer. The plugin comes with an integrated wallet system, which enables users to create or import both Liquid and mainchain wallets.“Merchants can receive or accept bitcoin by swapping incoming Lightning payments into their Liquid wallets and, like this, they don’t have to operate a node,” Kilian, CEO of Boltz, told Bitcoin Magazine.“What they are holding in the end is LBTC — Liquid BTC,” he added.“We also want to give them an option to automatically swap back to the mainchain if they so choose. They can say, ‘Okay, if my Liquid Bitcoin balance reaches 0.1 bitcoin, 0.5 bitcoin, swap it back to the mainchain.’”Merchants remain in control of their funds at all times while using the service.Boltz designed the plugin to help alleviate the anxiety that comes with running and managing a Lightning node.“Running and managing a Lightning node is no easy feat,” said Boltz CTO Michael in a press release. “Channel management is complex and inbound liquidity can be such an alien concept”.Kilian echoed Michael’s sentiment, as he shared that “running your own Lightning node is neither a realistic nor recommended goal for many individuals, and even for professionals like merchants, as of today.”Previous solutions for accepting Lightning payments without running a node were custodial, introduced counterparty risk or were only available in certain jurisdictions.Given that this plugin is both brand new and the first of its kind, the team at Boltz noted that while the software is ready to be used, users should do so with caution because it could still have bugs. However, Kilian shared that the plugin indeed has handled thousands of transactions and that Strainly, a marketplace for hemp growers, is now completely running on it.“After one month testing the Boltz plugin in front of thousands of users, I can tell this truly is a game-changer,” said Alan, CEO of Strainly, who previously had mixed success using custodial Lightning solutions like LNBank and other Lightning Service Providers (LSPs) “Processing LN payments straight to and from a non-custodial Liquid wallet, plus automatically consolidating the Liquid balance to my non-custodial BTC wallet according to my own preset threshold: hands down the most impactful plugin ever released on BTCPay!”"

Bitcoin Magazine,There's Three Doors. Which One Will Bitcoin Step Through?,"Wed, 25 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-three-doors-which-one-will-bitcoin-step-through,"A look at a prolific post by the infamous Mircea Popescu, positing with a rare clairvoyance the possible paths that Bitcoin could take in its road into the future.","   WHAT WE'RE READING: One of the most iconic blog posts in Bitcoin history Mircea Popescu is a mostly forgotten figure in this space, but he was once a very impactful cultural figure early on before he slowly faded out of the wider public sphere to eventually “accidentally” drown off the coast of Costa Rica. He was quite an insane and eccentric, but he has left a lasting impact on this space. I would argue he is essentially the Godfather of what people these days consider “toxic maximalism,” although compared to people who claim that label today he would make them seem like overly sensitive and whiny children.   Follow Shinobi on X  One of his most prolific posts in my mind was his consideration of the price of Bitcoin and the market dynamics that entails in the long term, from 2013. He was discussing the dynamics of supply and demand interacting with each other, and specifically the mentality of current bitcoin holders in contrast with average consumers that may or may not have an incentive to attempt to accumulate bitcoin in response to the deterioration of the fiat system. He framed the posited friction between these two groups as an impasse, where current holder have no great incentive to part with their bitcoin, and people trying to get rid of their devaluing fiat have no real recourse if holders of bitcoin act in that way. He proposed three possible solutions to that impasse. “One of them is that consumers yield and submit, Bitcoin goes to somewhere in the thousand dollars per range and there's a rush to move society away from the dysfunctional standard. Banks start taking Bitcoin deposits, Bitcoin hedge funds pop up everywhere, the FED chairman, ECB chairman and everyone else come to Timisoara whenever they want to make a move to obtain my blessing and so forth.”This is the path we are seemingly on right now. Capitulation of the existing system, integration into the legacy financial system, the veneration of early adopters and Bitcoin as a solution to the systemic problems of fiat. This is what Bitcoiners currently cheer on in terms of our path forward, citing every tiny piece of news from a banking institution, an ETF, an investment fund, as proof that they are capitulating! We have won! This is pure and utter delusion. Trump pandering to Bitcoiners seeking campaign financing does nothing to truly benefit Bitcoin, he is and will always be a fan of the dollar. His mentality is based around the idea of the money printer, and exporting our inflation globally, being a massively positive thing for American interests. The Democrats overwhelmingly are antagonistic towards the space, for similar reasons. Even if such a future was to truly come to pass, in actuality and not just in name, it would be a very dire and depressing future for anyone who looks to Bitcoin as a tool for freedom and sovereignty. Using Bitcoin would provide that to almost no one. Hedge funds, banks, ETFs, would all be the keyholders for the vast majority of people. No one would truly have any degree of freedom, it would be the same financial system we exist in now where nothing can be done without seeking the permission of some overlord who truly has control of your funds. Regulations would not enable more competition in this sphere, the existing players would take advantage of their revolving doors to encourage capture and high walls around their privileged position in this role. This path would essentially mean failure of Bitcoin as a tool for freedom, and the same game we see being played right now with slightly stricter rules for the privileged few who can get a seat at the table. “Another one of them is that consumers revolt, governments intervene, we all spend the remainder of this decade fighting with each other. Bitcoin also goes to thousands of dollars per, but the energy, effort and resources which could have been expended on comfortably yielding and productively submitting are wasted in an ultimately doomed effort to play tough on a weak hand. Neutral and unengaged governments win, and as the dust settles the balance of macroeconomic power has shifted from the Western world to whatever, China, Iran, Brazil, what have you.”This is the path of them fighting Bitcoin overtly. People actually start switching to Bitcoin en masse, and governments react in a reflexive manner to try to prevent this. Things domino from here as Bitcoin begins to become a more important aspect of global finance outside of the purview of the legacy financial system, and countries that fight and refuse to let it happen wind up just screwing themselves over as smaller and more adaptive jurisdictions who stay out of it or embrace this change wind up benefiting enormously. In this world Western governments make using Bitcoin an enormously difficult task, but people persevere anyway. The rest of the world with a brain stays out of the way, or proactively embraces it, while the West spends all of its effort and resources futilely fighting the inevitable. The rest of the world experiences a financial renaissance, while the Western world stagnates, its citizens forced to fight uphill the entire time to retain any degree of economic success (or even just staying afloat). As brutal as it sounds, this is the world I want to see. One where the West’s domination and coercive control over the rest of the world erodes. We have no special right to lord over the rest of the world in the manner we do, and this path forward would strip us slowly over time of the ability to continue doing so. Citizens of the West can embrace Bitcoin, and stand up for our individual freedoms and sovereignty, and in doing so cushion ourselves from the collapse of our corrupt institutions. A victory in revolution doesn’t come free or easy. For Bitcoin to really do what many of us hope it can, it’s really necessary at the end of the day to walk a painful path. And that means people have to choose to walk it. Many people in this space think that governments will simply roll over and let Bitcoin win, but that is just a feint to move in and capture it. We need to push to build around them, build in parallel, and force their hand. If they don’t actively fight it, then there is something else going on. That isn’t good for us. “Yet another one of them is that consumers revolt, entrepreneurs intervene, before the end of 2015 there's about a thousand to a million different Bitcoin forks, each with its ten million-ish monetary base worth about a dollar, on global average. The size of the inter-Bitcoins market, the complexity and confusion ensuing makes pretty much everything unmanageable for the ""ordinary person"". Hedge funds and banks (the ones a little ahead of using Excel) that trade in this murky complexity make a killing and become the principal driver of economic growth worldwide. Not only is the consumer about as screwed as is currently the case, but to everyone's benefit he has just been clearly proven yet again that revolt = being fucked in the ass harder, longer, with a thicker implement with sharper barbs on it. Also conveniently, the thing to revolt at has become much more vague and intangible. On the balance of probabilities this would seem the most likely outcome, strictly because history unerringly flows in that direction which most cruely rapes the ""average person"".”Popescu rated this as the most likely outcome. Constant fragmentation, Bitcoin shattering into an innumerable number of forks from the original. Each region, or group of people with a different idea, breaking off into their own different networks. Erosion of the network effect until it localizes with more sub-fragments than people can keep track of. Everyone assumes that this is over, that this door was simply a phase we passed through during and in the immediate aftermath of the blocksize wars, and it is closed forever. That is delusional. Nation states are adopting Bitcoin, major financial institutions that essentially write government policy are stepping on stage and integrating it into their systems. The world is a game of coercion and extortion politics, the US invades countries and slaughters hundreds of thousands of people simply to keep the flow of commodities moving in the direction it wants to. To imagine they and other interests wouldn’t fork Bitcoin for their own self interest at a global scale is naive. I would even go so far as to say that opening the first door, the “capitulation” and capture of Bitcoin quickly by these people would almost guarantee that this last door eventually opens. This is a failure of the utmost degree. Fragmentation, no singular network effect that enforces a true scarcity of supply, and more importantly rules, on economic players globally. A brief respite and then immediate return to the game we know now. Complete and utter failure of any form of revolution. All three of these doors are still sitting there, we haven’t walked through any of them yet. It’s anyone’s guess which one we eventually do. Bitcoiners could do with a little humility, and recognition of the fact that not only have we not even come close to winning, but failure is absolutely still on the table. In multiple ways. This article is a Take. Opinions expressed are entirely the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine."
Bitcoin Magazine,Israel Goes Cashless,"Wed, 25 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/israel-goes-cashless,"Israel’s promoting a new plan to abolish 200 shekel banknotes, forbid possession of physical gold & silver, and use AI for enforcement, while Gaza's state of cash deteriorates. By Efrat Fenigson.","A few days ago, a new initiative promoted by Prime Minister Netanyahu was announced - removing 200 shekel bills from circulation, as a first step to abolish cash altogether within a few years.The official excuse? fighting financial crimes and black money in the Arab society. (For those who aren’t aware, 1.6m citizens in Israel are Arab, which stands for 17% of the country’s population).As expected, this move - identical to India’s move in 2016 - will cause further destabilisation of Israel’s economy and of its citizens’ physical and mental states. A derivative of this economical shake up will ripple into Gaza who is relying on the Israeli shekel as its currency, and clearly, its population is heavily reliant on cash.So let’s break it down.   Abolishing 200 shekel notesThe value of the Israeli 200 shekel bills surpasses 100 billion shekels, and make up nearly 80% of the bank notes held by the public. In recent attempts to smear cash holders, it was reported that “most of the 200 shekel bills are not used for purchases, but for the accumulation of black capital.” A team of so called experts: nine businessmen and former officials in the public sector, who initiated the idea to abolish these bills, claim that the bills’ removal will recover more than 20 billion shekels ($5.3b) by next year, and 110 billion shekels ($29b) in the next 5 years - bringing it back to the state, and will force tax evaders to be revealed.Two weeks ago, the first mainstream media article about this new initiative popped up, to normalize and prepare people for this draconian measure.The proposed policy document suggests several steps to combat black capital:Removing the 200 shekel bills from circulation, as well as broadening the obligation to report on cash holding to the authorities. This is part of a larger plan to abolish cash completely in 3 phases: 1- limit cash transactions to 3,000 shekels ($800) within 2-3 years, 2- lower transaction amount to 2,000 shekels ($530), 3- cancel cash usage completely, while encouraging digital payment methods.Leveraging AI tools for monitoring and enforcing tax evasion,Launching a collaborative enforcement effort that includes various key bodies, such as the Tax Authority, the Anti-Money Laundering Authority, the police, the prosecutor’s office and the Counter-Terrorism Economic Warfare Headquarters.Banning the possession of cash substitutes, such as gold, silver, medals, and coins, on a significant scale.Enhancing regulation of non-banking financial entities, including currency exchange services, which manage significant volumes of illicit funds.Seizure of digital currencies linked to terrorist activities of sanctioned entities - “There are technologies that enable the real-time identification of such money transfers, and Israel needs to implement them immediately. This will allow for disrupting the flow of funds for terrorism and crime, identifying terrorist operatives, and seizing hundreds of millions of dollars for the state, potentially billions in the future”. (This part is from a leaked draft of the plan dated March 2024; it did not appear in mainstream media publications - E.F)Lo and behold, two weeks after the first “suggestion” of this new policy, Prime Minister Netanyahu announced he’s now advancing this reform urgently in order to fight black capital, especially amongst the Arab population, and called in a special committee to discuss the new policy.Israel already introduced a new “big brother” regulation last year, for pre-approving any B2B transaction with the Tax Authority, over 25K shekels. The new policy plan now proposes lowering the threshold for transactions requiring pre-approval from the Tax Authority from 25K shekels ($6,750) to 5K shekels ($1,350), a highly controversial move.Israel’s largest mainstream publication, Ynet, reminded its readers that “Similar steps have been implemented in other countries. In parts of China, the use of cash has been completely banned in certain cities.” Israel’s governing bodies love using “other countries are doing it already too” excuse to justify their acts. The same mantra is being played again and again when the Digital Shekel is mentioned. I recently listened to a podcast with Israel’s Central Bank governor which mentioned favorably how advanced the ECB is with the Digital Euro, for example.I asked Roger Huang, an author and a journalist, about the accuracy of this statement re. China’s cashless cities: “China's central bank actually makes it illegal to not accept cash as a payment option and has punished businesses (http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-01/21/c_139687310.htm) in the past for doing so, even during COVID. This is in direct contradiction to a statement justifying restrictions on cash in Israel that certain cities ban the use of cash. This has not been reported, and with no primary source verified, hard to prove. The Chinese central bank's actions suggest the opposite. Though China is going more cashless and is the most aggressive country at advancing a CBDC/central bank digital currency (the e-CNY/digital yuan), it has not implemented bans or restrictions on using cash - and in fact its central bank punishes those that restrict the use of cash.”• Israel’s is promoting an initiative to abolish the 200 shekel bank notes as a first step to narrow use of & abolishing cash. Same as in India in 2016. • Physical gold & silver may be forbidden to hold. 🪙💰• Gaza’s population suffering from financial oppression via lower… pic.twitter.com/XUbCUKDgFE— Efrat Fenigson (@efenigson) September 22, 2024  My video on the new 200 bills plan went viral with 70K views, share it hereIndia removed 500 & 1000 Rupee bills in 2016In November 2016, the Indian government made a similar decision to the one Israel is now considering, by withdrawing 500 and 1000 Rupee notes from circulation. In the aftermath of this decision, hundreds of people lost their lives, many more faced hardship, and the country's GDP took a significant hit.  Read this on BBC here    Read this article here  From this 2016 article on Vox:“Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets of cities throughout India to protest an economic policy you probably haven’t heard of before: demonetization.Three weeks ago, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi surprised his country with an announcement banning 500- and 1,000-rupee notes — worth about $7 and $15 respectively — in a bid to tackle corruption and terrorism.He estimated that forcing people to exchange the country’s largest currency bills for new banknotes would allow the government to crack down on “black money” — unaccounted-for cash holdings that haven’t been taxed but, under the law, should be. He also argued that it would strike at domestic terrorist financing operations by capturing counterfeit money and rendering the legitimate cash they kept in the shadows worthless.Banning widely used banknotes would have a huge impact on any economy, but in India the policy is transformative. Modi’s sudden ban instantly meant that 86 percent of all the cash in circulation in India was no longer considered legal tender, which means that businesses could refuse to accept those bills as a form of payment. And the Indian economy simply runs on cash: It’s estimated that between 90 and 98 percent of all transactions in India, measured in terms of volume, involve it.Unsurprisingly, Modi’s demonetization initiative has caused chaos across the country. People want new banknotes, but the current supply of them isn’t close to meeting demand. That’s created headaches for people as they wait in long lines outside ATMs and banks, which routinely run out of cash. For people who rely on daily cash earnings to survive, it can mean not being able to obtain food.”In this excellent lecture by Andreas Antonopoulos, a famous Bitcoin developer and lecturer, dating back to 2016, Andreas discusses the currency war of countries. He details the cash crisis in India and other examples of countries where citizens are punished due to failed currencies (Venezuela, Argentina, Ukraine, Turkey and more).All of these trials conducted in one country, serve as testing grounds for future implementations elsewhere (such as the 2012 bank deposit confiscations in Cyprus or efforts to protect banks from collapse in the U.S. over the years). As debt continues to rise, the economic situation deteriorates, and inflation worsens, these experiments will only speed up. We can expect more taxes, further restrictions on cash, more confiscations, and rising prices alongside inflation. Eventually, this deteriorating state will provide a sufficient justification to introduce a new digital control system known as the CBDC, if another “crisis” or “emergency” doesn’t precede it.Additional cash restrictions in IsraelIsrael’s government has been tightening its policy on cash usage in recent years; Today, there are still no official restrictions on the amount of cash that can be kept at home, but the government has repeatedly emphasized that it does not view this practice favorably and prefers that as many transactions as possible be conducted through non-cash payment and money management methods. At the same time, the government is working to advance legislation that would make it illegal to hold more than 200,000 shekels in cash. Additionally, holding cash amounts of 50,000 shekels or more would require providing explanations to the authorities about the source of the money and its intended use.In August 2022, Israel announced it forbids cash purchases larger than 6,000 shekels. This reform aims, according to a statement issued by Israel’s Tax Authority, to fight organized crime, money laundering and tax non-compliance.The Jerusalem Post reported back in 2022:Under the new law, any payment to a business above 6,000 NIS ($1,700) must be made using alternative methods, such as a digital transfer or a debit card. Trading between private citizens who are not listed as business owners will be limited to 15,000 NIS ($4,360) in cash. This is another step in Israel’s fight against the use of cash. Previously, cash up to the amount of 11,000 NIS ($3,200) could be used in business deals. “We want the public to reduce the use of cash money,” adv. Tamar Bracha, who is in charge of executing the law on behalf of Israel’s Tax Authority, told The Media Line. “The goal is to reduce cash fluidity in the market, mainly because crime organizations tend to rely on cash. By limiting the use of it, criminal activity is much harder to carry out.”“The goal is to reduce cash fluidity in the market, mainly because crime organizations tend to rely on cash” — Adv. Tamar Bracha, Israel’s Tax Authority, 2022Gaza’s state of cashThe cash shortage in Gaza has intensified the already dire conditions, making it even harder for people to buy essential food and supplies.In Gaza, the scarcity isn't limited to food, water, and electricity. Almost a year into the conflict, there's a severe shortage of cash. Banks have been destroyed, and frequent power outages have rendered ATMs inoperable. Reports from the region highlight how this lack of cash is worsening the daily struggle for survival, while raids by the IDF on Hamas outposts have uncovered millions of shekels and large sums of U.S. dollars stored there.  Credit: Ynet  Cleaning with soap and water and returning to customers: Gaza’s worn banknote crisisAs reported on Ynet:“A shortage of fresh cash and the closure of many bank branches due to the war have forced Gaza’s residents to reuse the same banknotes for almost a year. ""With so much use, the notes become worn and decayed, and I refuse to accept them,"" says one market vendor. Meanwhile, a new profession is emerging in the strip: cleaning and refurbishing worn banknotes.The closure of numerous bank branches in Gaza since the beginning of the war has led to a severe cash shortage, forcing residents to continue using old, tattered notes. A new trade called ""note cleaning"" is emerging, where old bills are cleaned and restored for reuse, with the service costing between 2 and 5 shekels per note.Merchants, particularly in northern Gaza, warn that the only real solution to this crisis is reopening the closed banks and injecting fresh cash into the market. Otherwise, the risk of counterfeit currency spreading grows.Additionally, cash withdrawals from ATMs in Gaza come with hefty fees ranging from 10% to 20%. Before the war, there were around 20 currency exchange offices in Gaza City alone, run by Hamas or taxed by the organization. These offices traded in various currencies and converted them, alongside several informal money changers operating in market corners.”Where do we go from here?Israel going cashless is another step in tightening control and violating property rights, for its citizens and its neighbors. This “going cashless” development is added to other worrying trends in Israel such as chewing on people’s pensions, and progressing Israel’s CBDC, the Digital Shekel.A new economic reality is ahead of us. In such times, learning about Bitcoin becomes a necessity, in order to hedge against government tyranny with the only truly decentralized, secure cryptocurrency which is controlled by no one, and is fully permissionless, outside of government control.This is a guest post by Efrat Fenigson.

Bitcoin Magazine,Building LNbits — the WordPress for Your Bitcoin Lightning Node — With Ben Arc,"Tue, 24 Sep 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/building-lnbits-the-wordpress-for-your-bitcoin-lightning-node-with-ben-arc,Ben Arc and the talented team of developers behind LNbits are helping users do more with Lightning.,"Company Name: LNbitsFounders: Ben ArcDate Founded: Project: 2019 | Company: 2022Location of Headquarters: Fully remote (most developers based in Europe)Amount of Bitcoin Held in Treasury: N/ANumber of Employees: 6 (+ “a couple dozen other developers”)Website: https://lnbits.com/Public or Private? PrivateFive years ago, Ben Arc first had the vision for LNbits — free and open-source software that works with any Lightning Network funding source and offers a suite of extensions for both personal and business use cases.The vision for the project came to him in what he describes as a flash of inspiration.“Christian Russo, the developer of the RaspiBlitz, had come down to visit and I remember sitting in a little wash cottage where he was staying, and I just sat on the sofa and I kept going, ‘LNbits, LNbits, LNbits,’” Arc told Bitcoin Magazine. “And then I was like, ‘I think I'm going to make this project where it can be set on top of any funding source and you'll get this common API and then have some wallets and stuff.’”Soon after, Arc, a Bitcoiner based in Wales, began working on the first LNbits project, a point of sale (PoS) extension for his friend Jörg Platzer, owner of the now defunct Berlin-based Bitcoin bar Room 77.“We managed to get the PoS in the bar, and Jörg was amazed how well it worked,” recounted Arc.“What he really wanted was like an accountancy layer from which you could export CSV and then import it into different wallets, so you could have different PoSs and they’d have different wallets. None of that stuff was possible in the node implementations at the time,” he added.“So, we needed to build that for Jörg, and then I needed to build something so I didn’t have to keep replicating work when it came to creating different versions of projects.”That something was LNbits.The LNbits Developer Team FormsIn the years that followed, some of the brightest developers in the Bitcoin and Lightning space gravitated to LNbits, making contributions that would help put the project on the map.These developers included Calle, creator of Cashu; fiatjaf, creator of Nostr; Pavol Rusnak, co-founder of Satoshi Labs and a host of other notable names and pseudonyms including but not limited to dni, Eneko, Vlad Stan, supertestnet and Black Coffee. (Arc also shared that the initial design for Nostr “partly came out of LNbits” and that Cashu “was an LNbits project for such a long time.”)This makes the LNbits developer team the Wu-Tang Clan of Bitcoin and Lightning developers — an über-talented supergroup whose members do groundbreaking work both together and on their own.And if the LNbits developer team is Wu-Tang, then Arc is the RZA, the head of the group who organizes things and helps set up business deals. That said, the LNbits team came together less because of a master plan by Arc and more out of practicality.“LNbits came out of necessity because a lot of us were replicating work,” said Arc. “A lot of us were having to make all these different versions of our projects for all these different node implementations,” he added, making the point that the primary motivation behind LNbits was to reduce redundancy.The team really came together when Arc learned that major entities in the space were beginning to use the software. At an Adopting Bitcoin conference in El Salvador, Arc bumped into some of the members of the team from IBEX, who mentioned that they were using LNbits.“They said, ‘We love our LNbits. We're using it for our products in our bank,’” recalled Arc.“And I was like, ‘Well, it was really buggy beta software. Please don't use it in your bank,” he added with a laugh.“At that point, everyone who was working on LNBits was like, ‘Okay, wow, people are using this thing. I think we now need to make a more stable version that people can use and access, particularly if they're putting it in their software stacks.’”Setting Up LNbits, The CompanyArc’s interaction with the IBEX team made him realize that the time had come to turn LNbits into a proper business.“We had to set up a company, which could then pay developers to work on LNbits,” said Arc.Arc paralleled the relationship between LNbits the open-source software and LNbits the company to WordPress.org and WordPress.com. WordPress.org is the company that manages and develops WordPress.com, which is open-source software.LNbits and WordPress are also similar in that anyone can develop extensions that give WordPress-powered websites extra functionality just as anyone can develop extensions for LNbits.While it’s easy to incentivize development in LNbits’ extension marketplace by allowing developers to charge for the extension they create, getting developers to work on the software itself is more difficult. Hence, Arc set up the company.“By setting up the company, we have some funds to put into the development work, which isn't so glamorous, isn't so fun,” said Arc of how LNbits approaches its software development.“You're less likely to kind of get people doing that on a free and open source project.”Funding LNbitsArc initially had some trepidation about telling the LNbits developer team that he was going to be setting up the business, though he was pleasantly surprised by their reaction when he shared the news.“I was very nervous with our free and open source community to break the news to them that we were going to set up a business to help fund development and stuff,” said Arc. “But when we told them, they were all super excited about it.”LNbits has since raised approximately $500k, and is now raising a $1 million seed round, an amount and an arrangement with which Arc is comfortable.“I really like private capital when it's beholden to a free and open source project,” said Arc.He went on to describe how LNbits would have had to have raised between $10 and $20 million if it had built LNbits as a proprietary piece of software. Building it organically has been far cheaper, and building with the Bitcoin community in mind all along has had benefits, as well.“To have this piece of software and then also have this community, which you're kind of beholden to, stops you from making bad decisions,” explained Arc.Coming Out Of BetaWhile LNbits has become more widely used over the last five years, it’s remained in beta all the while. Arc has been in no rush to officially release a product that he didn’t feel was stable enough.“In Bitcoin, a lot of projects come out of beta too early,” explained Arc.“It's just kind of a sad and scary reality that they want people to trust the software which they've developed, but we didn't want to do that. We really wanted to be very conservative,” he added.In preparation to release version one, LNbits has incorporated some funding and swapping services.“In the last release, we added PhoenixD as a funding source for LNbits,” began Arc, describing the server equivalent of the Phoenix Wallet for mobile.“We added the Breez SDK. We're using the Boltz swapping service for trustless Atomic Swaps in and out of Liquid. So, it means you can actually fund your LNbits with a Liquid Wallet, which absolutely blows my brain,” he added.The Future of LNbitsRight now, Arc seems to simply be focused on getting version one live and then continuing to fine tune it so that people and businesses can rely on it in a professional capacity. Arc wants to be sure the team is focused so that it can “debug on the fly” if and when necessary.Arc and the LNbits team also want to create more educational content around showing people how to use LNbits as well as how to create their own LNbits extensions.“That was a success of the project early on,” said Arc. “We just did a lot of educational content and everyone was like, ‘Okay, cool, I can try and build something on this thing.”While Arc also seems excited about how LNbits can further integrate with Nostr (he’s been toying around with running the Internet of Things (IoT) over Nostr), the most exciting part about the future for LNbits is its limitlessness.Put another way, in just five years, it has attracted brilliant developers who’ve created the earliest iterations of their revolutionary technologies (e.g., Cashu, Nostr) via LNbits, and this isn’t to mention all of the innovative LNbits extensions developers have created.The question now is who develops via LNbits in the next five years and what do they create?While Arc doesn’t claim to know, he is surely excited about what comes next, especially in the wake of version one going live.“Once we're version one, that's when the real fun begins,” said Arc. “We're starting to see glimpses of it, because we can just build fun extensions for functionality and build out product services,” he added.“That really is when the fun begins for the project.”"

When asked, nearly every attendee said they owned Bitcoin and crypto assets personally.Bitwise is a major Bitcoin and crypto index fund provider managing over $4.5 billion in assets. Earlier this year, the company secured regulatory approval for the first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S.Hougan said when he asked the same question at past advisor summits, only 10-20% would raise their hands. Approximately 70% said they owned Bitcoin and crypto this year, representing a sea change.While fewer said they had allocated Bitcoin and crypto in client accounts yet, Hougan expects that to follow within 6-12 months based on past trends. He called it ""one of the most powerful signs of the times"" that top financial advisors are buying Bitcoin and crypto themselves.Hougan believes the launch of Bitcoin ETFs this year, which opened Bitcoin access to more investors, sparked the shift. But he says when advisors buy Bitcoin personally, it breeds familiarity and opens the path to later client allocations.The anecdote reveals surging Bitcoin ownership among influential finance professionals firsthand. As these elite advisors and money managers embrace Bitcoin, it validates and likely foreshadows a larger wave of institutional adoption."
Crypto Potato,Bitcoin Price to Recover Soon? This Popular Indicator Gives Hints,"Sat, 05 Oct 2024",https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-to-recover-soon-this-popular-indicator-gives-hints/,"A golden cross in the Coinbase Premium Index suggests a short-term Bitcoin price increase, with US demand on the rise.","The crypto market tumbled significantly as geopolitical tensions escalated after Iran launched missile strikes on Israel. Bitcoin, for one, dropped below $60,500 before staging a modest recovery. Despite this, demand from United States-based investors remains high, according to recent findings. Such a trend could provide Bitcoin with a respite from the bears. US Investor Demand Remains Strong In an October 3 post, CryptoQuant noted the chance of a short-term Bitcoin price increase. The Coinbase Premium Index signals a potential short-term increase in Bitcoin’s price. By tracking the 1-hour time frame and comparing the 24-hour and 168-hour moving averages, CryptoQuant analyst Yonsei_dent found that a bullish indicator has emerged when the daily moving average forms a golden cross over the weekly. At present, the daily average has temporarily surpassed the weekly average, with the gap between the two narrowing, suggesting upward momentum. Historically, this pattern has led to short-term price increases, as seen on October 1st, when strong US investor demand pushed Bitcoin higher despite a correction. The current rise in Coinbase Premium indicates a similar scenario, with growing demand from US-based investors potentially indicating a recovery in Bitcoin’s price. Source: CryptoQuant Bitcoin Sees Record Outflows from Exchanges Adding to this bullish thesis, another analysis by CryptoQuant revealed that Bitcoin has experienced its largest outflow from exchanges since November 2022, signaling a shift in market sentiment. On-chain data shows a marked increase in outflows, with the 30-, 50-, and 100-day moving averages all reflecting this trend. A significant outflow typically indicates that investors are moving their Bitcoin to private wallets, reducing the supply on exchanges, which can create much-needed upward pressure on the price of the asset. This trend often suggests that investors are confident in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, opting to hold rather than trade, which may be a bullish indicator for future market activity.

CryptoQuant analysts say this year will be no different; however, things are not adding up. According to a CryptoQuant report, Bitcoin’s apparent demand growth is still slow, and it will need to grow at faster rates to propel and sustain price rises in Q4. BTC Demand Needs to Pick-up Seasonal performances seen in 2012, 2016, and 2020, which are all halving years, recorded increases of 9%, 59%, and 171%, respectively, for the price of BTC. So far in 2024, bitcoin’s performance has been similar to patterns seen in 2016 and 2020, indicating a high chance that the price would rally in the coming months. The only difference between 2024 and 2020 is that BTC entered Q4 hovering between the bull and bear phases this year, while the asset entered Q4 2020 in a clear bull phase. The CryptoQuant Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator tracked this movement, signaling that BTC had been hovering between the bull and bear phases for the past three weeks. Demand needs to grow for BTC to remain steady in the bull phase. Based on past trends, analysts expect it to resume, possibly leading to an increase in short-term supply. The launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier in 2024 caused a spike in supply, which reflected high demand as long-term holders sold to new buyers. Currently, Bitcoin’s apparent demand growth appears muted, and it has been so since July, oscillating between -23,000 and +69,000 BTC monthly. This metric grew by 496,000 BTC in April when the asset was hovering at $70,000; hence, there is a lot of room for growth in Q4. BTC Targets $85K to $100K Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States are already showing signs of increasing demand. They moved from net selling 5,000 BTC in early September to buying roughly 7,000 BTC by the end of the month. Analysts said this is the highest daily purchase since July 21. Meanwhile, on-chain data valuation metrics suggest BTC could rally to $85,000 or $100,000 once prices pick up in Q4. Analysts called these target prices the upper and maximum levels of traders’ on-chain realized bands.

In a press briefing on Oct. 3, Kozack emphasized that the IMF’s main recommendation is a “narrowing of the scope of the Bitcoin law, strengthening the regulatory framework and oversight of the Bitcoin ecosystem.” The IMF has voiced concerns regarding the potential risks posed by Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador, a key topic in negotiations on the country’s new lending program. The discussions aim to create a framework of policies that could aid in boosting productivity and strengthening economic reforms. Kozack added: “Addressing risks arising from Bitcoin is a key element of these discussions.” El Salvador made headlines in 2021 as the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, a move that has spurred mixed reactions. While the country’s economy has seen positive growth, including a GDP increase of over 10% and a significant reduction in crime rates, the IMF continues to express reservations about the financial risks tied to Bitcoin’s volatility. The IMF’s concerns coincide with El Salvador’s newly presented 2025 budget proposal, which Kozack described as “a step in strengthening public finances.” The proposal includes measures to control the nation’s budget, focusing on spending and implementing reforms to improve governance. Despite El Salvador’s achievements, including a 95% decrease in the murder rate and a 95% boost in tourism in 2023, some international institutions remain cautious about Bitcoin’s long-term impacts on the country’s financial stability. Supporters of the Bitcoin experiment, including prominent figures such as President Nayib Bukele, have defended the initiative, citing significant economic improvements since its adoption. VanEck’s head of digital assets research, Mathew Sigel, criticized the IMF for “holding El Salvador hostage over Bitcoin.” He further highlighted several notable achievements since the country adopted Bitcoin, including El Salvador’s GDP growth, declining crime rate, and booming tourism. Sigel praised President Nayib Bukele for driving what he called a “remarkable transformation,” urging the president to “stand firm” in his vision for the country. While the government remains firm in its commitment to Bitcoin, the IMF has insisted that any future lending program must address these risks, signaling that El Salvador’s approach to crypto will remain a central focus of its discussions with the international lender.

The company’s crypto futures ETFs — including the Bitwise Bitcoin Strategy Optimum Roll ETF (BITC), the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH), and the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP) — will be rebranded to the Bitwise Trendwise Bitcoin and Treasuries Rotation Strategy ETF (BITC), the Bitwise Trendwise Ethereum and Treasuries Rotation Strategy ETF (AETH), and the Bitwise Trendwise BTC/ETH and Treasuries Rotation Strategy ETF (BTOP), respectively. The fund manager expects the adjustment to occur by Dec. 3. Notably, this move comes during the same week that the asset manager applied to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot XRP ETF. Bitwise Trendwise ETFs According to the statement, these ETFs will adjust their exposure to crypto or US Treasuries, depending on market conditions. During positive market trends, they will focus on crypto investments, while during downturns, they will shift to US Treasuries. Bitwise explained that the Trendwise strategy improves risk-adjusted returns by taking advantage of market momentum while offering protection during bearish conditions. The strategy relies on a proprietary signal that monitors the 10- and 20-day exponential moving averages (EMA) of crypto prices. So, when the 10-day EMA surpasses the 20-day EMA—signaling upward momentum—the funds will invest in crypto. If the situation reverses, the funds will rotate into US Treasuries. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan explained that this strategy reflects broader trends in asset management. He stated: “The new Trendwise strategies capitalize on that momentum through a trend-following strategy that rotates between crypto and Treasuries exposure based on market direction. The goal is to help minimize downside volatility and potentially improve risk-adjusted returns.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin market analyst Joe Consorti praised the development, stating: “This is massive news for bitcoin as a macro asset. US Treasuries are the preferred asset for all of the world’s financial institutions. Adding bitcoin to a rotating investment vehicle will juice UST returns and be an enticing diversifier for UST-heavy balance sheets.” These changes will not impact the funds’ expense ratios or tax treatment, so current investors will not need to take any action.

According to the firm’s September recap report, Bitcoin surged 7.7% over the month, buoyed by the Federal Reserve’s rate cut and China’s economic stimulus. It outpaced Ethereum, which managed only a 3.2% gain over the same period. Bitcoin and Ethereum VanEck said that Bitcoin’s rally, which saw $1.2 billion in net inflows into US Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs), indicates growing investor confidence. These ETPs have accumulated more Bitcoin than has been mined since their launch, playing a crucial role in price formation. In contrast, Ethereum continued to lose ground, with fee generation dropping sharply as its market share hit five-year lows. Despite the poor performance, Ethereum showed signs of stabilization mid-month, as its fee market share rebounded from 31% in August to 45% in September. Ethereum’s shift to a settlement layer for Layer-2 blockchains, following the implementation of EIP-4844, has reduced demand for its blockspace, leading to a sharp decline in transaction revenues from $7.2 billion in March to $1.2 billion in September. VanEck suggested that while Ethereum’s long-term strategy aims to support mass adoption, its short-term underperformance could challenge its position in the market. On the other hand, Bitcoin continues to show resilience, with institutional inflows and strong price momentum reinforcing its dominant position in the digital asset space. Top metrics Layer-1 blockchains dominated in September, with Sui leading the pack, surging 118% to reach a $5 billion market cap. The network also saw a significant 140% growth in daily active addresses (DAAs) and a 48% growth in revenue, driven primarily by memecoin speculation and native stablecoin activity. Aptos also performed strongly, climbing 23%, despite a token unlock worth $90 million. The growth was largely attributed to the Raptr software upgrade, which bolstered transaction speeds and boosted daily active addresses by 30%. Solana rounded out the top three performers after surging 14% over the period. This was fueled by the much-anticipated release of the “Firedancer” upgrade, which promises to enhance transaction throughput and network reliability. Firedancer, currently in testnet, achieved 89,000 transactions per second, a notable improvement for the Solana network. Meanwhile, Polygon underperformed the wider market, falling by 4% amid a sharp drop in daily active users and a 50% reduction in fee generation. Despite these challenges, the network continued with its Polygon 2.0 roadmap, successfully migrating the MATIC token to POL with the goal of enhancing interoperability and scalability. Memecoins posted a 31% gain in September, while DeFi tokens followed with a 19% increase. Layer-1 tokens as a whole rose 11%, with crypto equities gaining 11% as well.

[…]The postBitcoin’s performance as US labor market normalizes after pandemic disruptionappeared first onCryptoSlate.","The post-COVID US labor market is finally experiencing a nuanced shift, reflecting a blend of resilience and gradual normalization after the unprecedented disruptions of the pandemic. By weaving together the latest data on job quits, wage growth, unemployment, job openings, and inflation, we can create a comprehensive picture highlighting opportunities and challenges for everyday people. Employment Trends and Labor Participation The unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in September 2024, the lowest in three months, with 281,000 fewer people unemployed and 430,000 more employed individuals, bringing total employment to 161.864 million. This decline suggests that more people are finding jobs and that the labor market is absorbing workers at a steady pace. The labor force participation rate remains steady at 62.7%, while the employment-population ratio has increased slightly to 60.2%. While these figures indicate stability, the participation rate is still below pre-pandemic levels, suggesting that some individuals remain out of the workforce due to factors like childcare responsibilities, health concerns, or early retirements prompted by the pandemic. Wage Growth and Purchasing Power Average hourly earnings rose 4.0% year-over-year in September 2024, the most significant increase in four months and above market expectations. This wage growth enhances income levels for everyday workers and potentially improves living standards. Importantly, this wage increase outpaces the current inflation rate, which slowed to 2.5% in August 2024, the lowest since February 2021. The deceleration in inflation, especially with declining energy and food costs, means that real wages (adjusted for inflation) are increasing. Workers are earning more nominally and gaining greater purchasing power, allowing them to afford more goods and services than in the past. Job Openings and Labor Market Conditions Job openings decreased to 8.095 million in August 2024 from 8.378 million in July, signaling a cooling in employer demand for new hires. While this number is still above the historical average of around 5.4 million, the decline suggests that businesses may be becoming more cautious about expanding their workforce. Factors such as economic uncertainty, supply chain disruptions, or anticipation of lower consumer demand could influence hiring decisions. For job seekers, this may translate to fewer available positions and potentially increased competition for existing openings. Job Quits and Worker Confidence The job quit rate decreased to 1.90% in August 2024, falling below the historical average of 2.01% and significantly down from the all-time high of 3% in November 2021. A lower quits rate may indicate that workers are less confident in the labor market’s ability to provide alternative employment opportunities or are more content with their current jobs. This shift could be due to a perceived slowdown in economic growth or concerns about job security amid changing market conditions. For employees, this means staying put rather than seeking new opportunities, impacting career mobility and wage negotiation power. Inflation and Cost of Living Inflation’s continued slowdown to 2.5% benefits consumers by reducing the rate at which prices for goods and services rise. Significant decreases in energy costs, particularly gasoline and fuel oil, alleviate household financial pressure. Food and transportation inflation has also eased, contributing to a lower overall cost of living. However, shelter costs have increased, with housing inflation rising to 5.2%, which could strain budgets for renters and potential homebuyers. The balance between wage growth and inflation is crucial; with wages growing faster than inflation, workers effectively gain more financial stability. Holistic Implications for US Citizens For the average person, these intertwined trends suggest a labor market that is robust yet stabilizing. Employment opportunities remain available, and rising wages enhance earning potential. The slowing of inflation further amplifies the positive impact on disposable income and purchasing power. However, the decrease in job openings and the quits rate hints at a labor market that may become less favorable to job seekers in the near future. Employers may hold more leverage in wage negotiations, and job mobility could decline. In essence, while workers currently enjoy the benefits of increased wages and lower inflation, they should remain mindful of the evolving labor market forces. Economic indicators suggest caution as the labor market shows signs of cooling from its post-pandemic surge. We see a US labor market transitioning from the rapid changes induced by the pandemic towards a more normalized state. Declining unemployment, rising wages, decreasing job openings, and slowing inflation provide a multifaceted view of the economy, highlighting both positive developments and areas that warrant attention for everyday people. Bitcoin’s Role in the Post-COVID Economic Landscape In addition to traditional economic indicators, the performance of alternative assets like Bitcoin offers further insights into the current US economic landscape. Bitcoin’s price experienced a remarkable surge since the start of the pandemic, rising from $7,365 in January 2020 to $61,309 on October 4, 2024. This represents an increase of over 730%. Over the past year alone, Bitcoin’s price has grown by 123.12%, highlighting significant investor interest and activity in the crypto market. Bitcoin’s Impact on Wealth and Investment The substantial appreciation of Bitcoin reflects a combination of factors, including increased institutional adoption, heightened interest in digital assets, and concerns about traditional currency inflation due to expansive monetary policies during the pandemic. For everyday people, this surge has several implications:  Wealth Creation for Investors: Individuals who invested in Bitcoin before or during the early stages of the pandemic may have seen substantial returns, enhancing their financial positions and spending power. This wealth effect can contribute to increased consumer spending, stimulating economic activity. Alternative Investment Opportunities: The strong performance of Bitcoin emphasizes a growing trend of diversifying portfolios with alternative assets. This shift indicates a changing investment landscape where cryptocurrencies are becoming more mainstream. Inflation Hedge Perception: Bitcoin is often viewed as a hedge against inflation. With traditional inflation rates slowing to 2.5% in August 2024, the appeal of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge may influence investment strategies.  Interplay with the Labor Market and Economy While Bitcoin’s rise is notable, its impact on the broader economy and labor market is multifaceted:  Investment Diversion: Capital flowing into Bitcoin may divert investments from traditional markets. However, this can also lead to innovation and job creation within the blockchain and fintech industries. Job Creation in New Sectors: The growth of the crypto market has led to new employment opportunities in the technology, finance, and regulatory sectors. This can positively affect the labor market by creating jobs that require specialized skills. Consumer Confidence and Spending: Significant gains in investments like Bitcoin can boost consumer confidence and lead to increased spending, further fueling economic growth.  Financial Considerations for Everyday People For the average person, the surge in Bitcoin’s value presents both opportunities and risks:  Potential for High Returns: Investing in Bitcoin can offer high returns, as evidenced by its substantial growth. This can be attractive for those looking to enhance their financial portfolios. Volatility Risks: Bitcoin is known for its price volatility. Rapid price fluctuations in the short term can lead to significant unrealized losses, making it a risky investment for those without a high-risk tolerance. Accessibility and Education: The complexity of crypto markets requires individuals to educate themselves thoroughly before investing. Access to reliable information and an understanding of market conditions are crucial.  Integrating Bitcoin’s Performance with Economic Indicators When we consider Bitcoin’s performance alongside traditional economic indicators, a more comprehensive picture emerges:  Wage Growth and Investment Capacity: With average hourly earnings increasing by 4.0% year-over-year in September 2024, individuals may have more disposable income to invest in assets like Bitcoin. This can lead to greater participation in the crypto market. Inflation and Asset Value: The slowing inflation rate, now at 2.5%, coupled with rising wages, means that individuals have more real income. This scenario can encourage investment in alternative assets as people seek to diversify their portfolios. Labor Market Forces: The decline in the unemployment rate to 4.1% and the increase in employment levels suggest a strengthening economy. A robust labor market can boost consumer confidence, potentially increasing investment in higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies.  By factoring in Bitcoin’s remarkable performance since the start of the pandemic, we observe an economy that is not only recovering in traditional terms—through employment, wages, and controlled inflation—but also evolving in how people engage with financial markets. The interplay between a strengthening labor market, rising wages, slowing inflation, and the surge in alternative investments like Bitcoin paints a complex economic portrait. In essence, the US economy post-COVID is characterized by resilience and adaptability. Traditional economic labor market indicators show positive trends, while the rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin reflects changing attitudes toward finance and investment. For individuals, staying informed and adaptable is key to navigating this dynamic economic environment.

Crypto News,Bitcoin ‘Destined’ to Break Below 60K Support Amid Geopolitical Tensions: Standard Chartered,"Fri, 04 Oct 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-destined-to-break-below-60k-support-amid-geopolitical-tensions-standard-chartered/,"Critical Bitcoin Support at $60,000 has come under scrutiny due to geopolitical risk fears, according to Standard Chartered Head of Digital Assets Research Geoff Kendrick.The postBitcoin ‘Destined’ to Break Below 60K Support Amid Geopolitical Tensions: Standard Charteredappeared first onCryptonews."," Critical Bitcoin Support at $60,000 has come under scrutiny due to geopolitical risk fears, according to Standard Chartered Head of Digital Assets Research Geoff Kendrick. In a recent note, Kendrick argued that Bitcoin does not currently represent a safe-haven asset amid ongoing geopolitical tensions. Following the crypto market’s plunge alongside stocks this week, triggered by Iran’s offensive against Israel, Kendrick stated that Bitcoin should not be viewed as a hedge against geopolitical risks.  Risk concerns related to the Middle East seem destined to push Bitcoin below $60,000.  While better-than-expected U.S. jobs data derailed Kendrick’s expectations for a break below this support “before the weekend,” the threat still remains. However, the analyst noted this potential dip as a buying opportunity that “should be bought into,” pointing to increased activity in Bitcoin options markets and a “circularity” effect involving U.S. presidential odds as factors that could support prices. Trump Overtakes Harris on Polymarket  Kendrick observed that the odds in the US presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have shifted slightly this week. According to Polymarket data, Trump’s chances of winning the election have recently recovered, overtaking Harris by 1% after a long period where Harris held the lead. US election outcome chances. Source: Polymarket. “This creates an interesting circularity for bitcoin,” Kendrick explained. “Geopolitical concerns may push prices lower, yet these very concerns seem to increase Trump’s odds, potentially improving bitcoin’s post-election outlook.” A Trump victory is seen as favorable for cryptocurrencies, particularly given his engagement at Bitcoin 2024 and his announcements regarding a decentralized finance (DeFi) project called World Liberty.  Analysts anticipate that Trump’s administration would accelerate progress on pro-crypto policies, with past Standard Chartered reports setting an end-of-year Bitcoin price target of $220K under a Trump presidency. However, the report also noted the potential for a Harris presidency to push Bitcoin to a new high, with a target of $75K, especially with her recent public endorsement of digital assets. Although Kendrick mentioned that her election might “likely trigger an initial price decline, we would expect investors to buy the dips as the market recognizes that progress on the regulatory front will still be forthcoming.” Bitcoin Open Interest Sets Strong Medium-term Sentiment Kendrick highlighted that recent market activity has shown a significant influx of Bitcoin call option positions. In the past two days, the amount of call option open interest for the 27 December expiry at an $80,000 strike price on Deribit jumped by 1,300 Bitcoin. This growing demand for call options suggests that many traders are betting on upward price movements, which can contribute to a positive market outlook for Bitcoin. The analyst cited this as further grounds for a buying opportunity, stating, “Positions like the $80k call options highlighted here and the circularity vis-à-vis Trump probabilities suggest the dip should be bought into.” This is just one of many factors contributing to what is expected to be an explosive Q4 for Bitcoin as catalysts line up in its favour.

This stronger-than-expected jobs report prompted macro traders to largely eliminate bets on another 50bps rate cut from the Federal Reserve in November.  According to the CME Fed Watch Tool, money markets are now pricing a nearly 95% probability of a 25bps rate cut next month.

Longer-term drivers, like a global monetary policy easing cycle, could drive Bitcoin back to record highs later in 2024 or in 2025. This scenario would align well with Bitcoin’s usual post-US election and delayed post-halving rally patterns.  While October may bring volatility, Bitcoin could still approach $100,000 in the coming quarters.

Bitcoin Magazine,Uncle Jack’s Chili is Good for Bitcoin,"Sat, 05 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/tommy-uncle-jacks-chili-is-good-for-bitcoin,"A self-proclaimed Bitcoin pleb and actual brain surgeon, Dr. Jack Kruse, has the sauce and I want everyone to try it.","     Follow Tommy on X.  This interview on the Danny Jones Podcast episode 263 both felt like it was being channeled from my own brain while also hitting me with an overload of new information. It hit the spot, as someone who has long held the opinion that all modern wars and psychological operations are symptoms of easy fiat money, and that the government is simply the biggest criminal cartel that grows large enough to self-legitimize its racket and assumes the role of moral authority. Kruse postulates that the goal of globalist transhumanists is to replace the U.S. Constitution, a document that is designed to protect individuals from government, with the U.N. Charter, a document designed to usurp it and provide tyrannical power to proxies of the industrial military complex. “I would sit down with, probably, Adolf Hitler before I would sit down with Sergey Brin.”I wasn’t expecting to hear about Bitcoin when I started listening, but I was pleasantly surprised to hear him bring it up early and often, framed as a kryptonite to the transhumanists he portrays as his “mortal enemy”. “The reason why Bitcoin content gets removed is because DARPA is not interested in Bitcoin. Their energy to fuel their whole process is cheap fiat money.”Uncle Jack hits on topics like Kleiber's law, allodial wealth, DARPA, MK-ULTRA (and it’s subsequent versions), the Stanford marshmallow experiment, JFK’s assassination, sunlight medicine, SV40, cancer, COVID and the jabs, and even invisibility, somehow connecting it all subtly to Bitcoin, with a ‘fix the money, fix the world’ subtext.“There’s a pattern with the Industrial Military Complex. When they want to do something, they don’t ask for forgiveness, they don’t ask for permission either, they just do it.”The main ingredient was essentially that the Federal fiat system is a big Ponzi scheme, citing Roth IRAs and retirement funds specifically. And that there is a mortal war waged on us by The State to make sure enough of us die through cancers, wars or otherwise so that we aren’t all performing a bank run.The Industrial Military Complex is a machine that is powered by cheap money: fiat money. Kruse aligns Bitcoin as a solution to the fiat war machine, which is preaching to the choir for me, but exciting to hear on a non-Bitcoin show with a large audience like the Danny Jones Podcast.This article is a Take.

Crypto Potato,Bitcoin and Crypto Become a Critical Factor in the US Elections: Research,"Sat, 05 Oct 2024",https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-and-crypto-become-a-critical-factor-in-the-us-elections-research/,"A majority want candidates to adopt clear stances on crypto, indicating that addressing crypto regulation could influence voter support.","A new survey by ConsenSys and HarrisX reveals that nearly half of U.S. voters (49%) consider a pro-crypto stance important when choosing political candidates. Additionally, 62% are willing to cross party lines for a candidate who supports pro-cryptocurrency policies. Crypto Regulation and Voter Sentiment The study also found that 85% of respondents want presidential candidates to adopt a clear position on cryptocurrency. The findings suggest that any party recognizing this could gain significant votes in the tightly contested race. Voters also expressed concerns about the current state of crypto regulation, with 44% of respondents feeling that the Biden administration is not doing enough to support the industry. Additionally, 78% said they would support politicians who focus on protecting users from crypto-related scams. Joe Lubin, CEO of ConsenSys and co-founder of Ethereum, addressed the study’s findings, stating, “There’s a myth that the crypto sector doesn’t want regulation, but that’s simply not true.” Lubin called for more regulatory clarity, noting that both parties need to recognize the importance of crypto as a bipartisan issue. “We’ve been operating under a cloud of uncertainty for too long,” he added. Despite growing interest in digital assets, the study found voters confused about which U.S. regulatory body currently oversees the sector. Only 15% of respondents correctly identified the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the regulator, while just 4% pointed to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). 11 % of the respondents believed the U.S. Treasury Department is responsible, and another 11% thought the industry was self-regulating. However, when asked which agencies understand the industry well enough to set crypto policies, 70% said the SEC, and 67% favored the CFTC. Political Figures’ Crypto Knowledge The study also examined public perceptions of U.S. politicians’ understanding of cryptocurrency. Former President Donald Trump was viewed as the most knowledgeable, with 53% of respondents saying he has a strong enough grasp of the sector to set appropriate policies. This was significantly higher than the 41% who rated Vice President Kamala Harris positively on the issue and the 36% who said the same for President Joe Biden. Meanwhile, voters are calling for clearer regulations and stronger fraud and consumer protections to boost confidence in cryptocurrency, with these concerns being consistent across key battleground states. Fraud prevention is another top concern for voters of all political affiliations, with Democrats and crypto owners pushing for greater transparency. Independents, meanwhile, prioritize clearer regulatory guidelines. Across the board, the biggest obstacle to investing in cryptocurrency is the perceived risk. The report suggests that voters need reassurances to change their views. The post Bitcoin and Crypto Become a Critical Factor in the US Elections: Research appeared first on CryptoPotato."

In a press conference on October 3, Julie Kozack, the director of the IMF’s communications department, highlighted the collaborative efforts between IMF staff and Salvadoran officials.  Their goal is to complete a new program supported by the IMF, which aims to stabilize the country’s economy, make necessary adjustments, and promote growth-focused reforms. However, the IMF’s recommendation reflects ongoing concerns about the risks associated with Bitcoin as a legal tender. If the country acts on this advice, it could lead to a more stable economic environment, attracting foreign investment and fostering sustainable growth.  IMF Continues to Hold El Salvador Hostage Over #Bitcoin, Despite:>GDP up 10%+ since adopting #Bitcoin, consistently outpacing regional peers>Murder rate down by 95% >Tourism up 95% in 2023 alone@nayibbukele, your vision is driving a remarkable transformation!Stand firm! pic.twitter.com/bk0kTkNHfQ— matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) October 3, 2024  Conversely, ignoring these recommendations may slow the country’s economic recovery and introduce uncertainty into the cryptocurrency market.  Ultimately, El Salvador’s response to the IMF’s guidance will play a crucial role in shaping its financial stability and could influence the future of cryptocurrency regulations across the region. IMF Recommends Strengthening Bitcoin Risk Management  The IMF stresses the importance of enhanced risk management concerning Bitcoin in its ongoing discussions with El Salvador.  Julie Kozack outlined several recommendations from the IMF, including narrowing the scope of El Salvador’s Bitcoin law, bolstering regulatory oversight, and reducing the government’s exposure to Bitcoin.  JUST IN: IMF calls for El Salvador to limit #Bitcoin exposure pic.twitter.com/dV2A3RhaCj— Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) October 4, 2024  These measures are intended to mitigate the potential risks of using Bitcoin as a legal tender. By taking these steps, El Salvador can work towards creating a more secure economic framework while ensuring that its approach to cryptocurrency remains responsible and sustainable. Kozack also mentioned that El Salvador’s budget proposal for 2025 is a positive move toward improving public finances. If implemented effectively, these changes could lead to a more stable financial environment, encouraging investment and supporting economic growth. IMF Expresses Continued Concerns Over El Salvador’s Bitcoin Adoption It is worth recalling that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised concerns about El Salvador’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.  Following this move in September 2021, the IMF warned that Bitcoin’s volatility could lead to financial instability and highlighted the lack of consumer protections in cryptocurrency transactions. They also noted that such innovations might complicate future financial assistance from the IMF. As of August 2024, while major risks had not yet occurred, the IMF continued to stress the importance of improving transparency and risk management related to Bitcoin. The agency recognized that more efforts are necessary to address potential fiscal and financial stability issues stemming from the Bitcoin initiative. Failure to heed these warnings could result in ongoing economic challenges and reduce El Salvador’s chances of securing future international financial support.  If the nation successfully aligns with the IMF’s recommendations, it could set a global example for integrating cryptocurrencies into national economies while maintaining financial stability.

Crypto News,Bitcoin Price Forecast: Russian Mining Industry Set to Overtake U.S. – How Will BTC React? ,"Sat, 05 Oct 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-forecast-russian-mining-industry-set-to-overtake-u-s-how-will-btc-react/,"Bitcoin's price could see increased volatility as Russia's mining industry expands, potentially surpassing the U.S. market. Explore the impact on BTC.The postBitcoin Price Forecast: Russian Mining Industry Set to Overtake U.S. – How Will BTC React?appeared first onCryptonews."," Bitcoin (BTC) has bounced back from its overnight dip, regaining traction above the $62,000 mark and briefly touching an intraday high of $62,400.  This renewed strength aligns with a 1.61% increase in the overall cryptocurrency market cap, now at $2.15 trillion.  One of the primary drivers behind Bitcoin’s price rise is the recent $25.59 million inflow into spot Bitcoin ETFs, led by the Bitwise ETF (BITB), which contributed $15.29 million. This pushed its historical inflow to a remarkable $2.11 billion, signalling growing investor confidence.  BREAKING: Yesterday the Spot #Bitcoin ETF saw $25 MILLION inflows pic.twitter.com/fMPESkxdYu— GOLD (@GOLD) October 5, 2024  In addition, the recent expansion of Russia’s Bitcoin mining sector, driven by new legislation, could make the country a serious competitor to the U.S. in the crypto-mining space.  This development may attract significant investments and increase demand for Bitcoin, potentially setting BTC up for continued gains in the weeks ahead. Russia’s Bitcoin Mining Poised for Growth Amid Regulatory Shifts and Global Competition Russia’s bitcoin mining industry is poised for significant growth following the approval of a new mining law. Igor Runets, CEO of Bitriver, sees this law as a game-changer, offering advantages that could help Russia catch up with the U.S. in the mining industry within two to three years.  However, the law encourages collaboration between bitcoin miners and oil and gas companies, especially the use of petroleum gas for mining.  Runets believes this will close the gap in mining capacity between the two countries. Russia currently uses 2.5 GW of energy for mining compared to the U.S.’s 7 GW.  Russian Bitcoin Mining Industry Could Surpass the American Industry in 2 Years  https://t.co/eL0IdQgpRX— Bitcoin.com News (@BTCTN) October 5, 2024  Runets also highlighted that U.S. political figures like Donald Trump and Kamala Harris focus on bitcoin mining because they fear losing the country’s leadership position. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has recognized the importance of the mining industry, particularly in Siberia, which has an energy surplus. Consequently, the growth of Russia’s bitcoin mining industry, fueled by new regulations, could increase mining competition globally.  This may lead to greater bitcoin supply, potentially stabilizing prices, but geopolitical factors could also introduce volatility in the market. Institutional Demand Pushes Bitcoin ETFs Higher and Boosts Price Stability Institutional interest in Bitcoin continues to grow, with U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs now holding nearly 4.6% of the total Bitcoin supply—valued at approximately $58 billion.  This increase highlights the preference of institutions for regulated investment vehicles over direct crypto purchases.  The recent success of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust has contributed significantly to this shift in sentiment, as more investors view Bitcoin as a stable asset.  JUST IN:  Spot #Bitcoin ETFs now hold almost 5% of the total supply of Bitcoin Demand is increasing, supply is decreasing  pic.twitter.com/PlKZpRnla3— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 4, 2024   Bitcoin ETFs offer transparency and security, making them attractive to institutional investors. Regulatory support and increased ETF approvals have simplified investment for financial institutions. Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against traditional market volatility has made it a stronger alternative to gold.  With these factors driving institutional demand, Bitcoin’s price stability and liquidity will likely improve, reinforcing its position as a legitimate asset class. Bitcoin Gains Momentum Above $62,000; Eyes $64,100 Target Bitcoin (BTC/USD) has gained modest traction, trading above the critical $62,000 mark after forming an ascending triangle pattern.  The successful breakout at this level suggests the potential for further upside, targeting key resistance levels at $62,850 and $63,450.  Immediate support is pegged at $61,200, with the next support levels at $60,500 and $60,000, respectively. If the price breaks below $62,000, we could see a strong bearish reversal. Bitcoin News The technical setup is further supported by the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently at $61,980. As long as prices remain above this line, the EMA reinforces the bullish sentiment.  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 59, signaling neither overbought nor oversold conditions. Thus, it indicates room for additional gains if the buying momentum continues. For the coming week, Bitcoin’s price action will largely depend on whether it can sustain its position above $62,000.  A daily close above this threshold would open the door for a move toward $64,100. Conversely, if bears gain control and push prices below $62,000, expect a pullback to at least $60,500, where the 200-day EMA at $60,000 should provide substantial support. Key Insights:  Ascending Triangle Breakout: A breakout above $62,000 signals bullish potential, targeting $64,100. Support Levels: Immediate support is at $61,200, followed by $60,500 and $60,000. Resistance Levels: Key resistance points to watch are $62,850, $63,450, and $64,100.  Overall, as long as Bitcoin holds above $62,000, the technical outlook remains bullish. A break below this level, however, could shift momentum in favour of the bears.

Crypto Potato,Bitcoin Miner TeraWulf Sells 25% Stake in Nautilus for $92 Million,"Sun, 06 Oct 2024",https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-miner-terawulf-sells-25-stake-in-nautilus-for-92-million/,The latest transaction has allowed the company to achieve a 3.4x return on its investment in Nautilus.,"Bitcoin mining firm TeraWulf has sold its 25% stake in the Nautilus Cryptomine joint venture to its partner, a subsidiary of Talen Energy, in a deal worth about $92 million. The company plans to use the funds to expand its operations at the Lake Mariner facility, including building the 20 MW CB-1 operation for hosting AI and high-performance computing (HPC) data centers. Additionally, TeraWulf also said that it is working on completing its fifth mining building, MB-5, and aims to reach a capacity of over 13 EH/s by early 2025 while improving mining efficiency to 18.2 J/TH. TeraWulf’s Strategic Move According to the official press release, TeraWulf is strategically preparing for the future by monetizing its interest in a power contract and ground lease set to expire in June 2027. This move is expected to allow it to focus resources on its Lake Mariner facility in New York, where it can benefit from lower power costs. Selling its minority stake in Nautilus will also simplify its financial statements, improving clarity for shareholders. Recently, TeraWulf completed a 2 MW proof-of-concept project for AI and high-performance computing (HPC) that supports current and next-gen GPU technologies. The company is also building a 20 MW colocation facility, CB-1, at Lake Mariner, designed to support a critical IT load of 16 MW with advanced cooling and redundancy features. Reinvesting the proceeds from the sale will keep CB-1 on schedule to become operational in Q1 2025. A subsequent building, CB-2, is planned for completion in Q2 2025 and targets a gross capacity of 50 MW. Commenting on the latest development, Paul Prager, Chief Executive Officer of TeraWulf, said, “Monetizing our interest in Nautilus ahead of the 2027 expiration of the highly advantageous 2¢/kWh power contract allows us to capture a significant premium for our investment, provide significant capital to invest into our HPC/AI infrastructure, and capitalize on our favorably structured miner purchase agreement to upgrade our mining fleet at a discount to the current market price.” TeraWulf’s Mixed Q2 2024 Results TeraWulf’s second-quarter earnings report, released in August, showed mixed results. As reported earlier, the company mined 699 BTC, down 21% from last year, but revenue reached $35.6 million, slightly above the expected $35.4 million. However, the company documented a loss of $0.03 per share, worse than the anticipated $0.02 loss. Additionally, mining costs surged 243% due to higher network difficulty and the effects of April’s Bitcoin halving.

The Ethereum-based funds are also in the red on a weekly scale, while the two underlying assets’ prices crashed to local lows. Bitcoin ETFs Break the Good Streak CryptoPotato reported last weekend the positive streak the BTC ETFs had experienced, attracting over $1.1 billion in net inflows within the span of just five trading days. Moreover, that Friday (September 27) was the best day in terms of allocated funds since early June. Consequently, BTC’s price soared from $62,000 to over $66,500 within the same week. However, the situation changed for the worse in the past five trading days as investors pivoted from their strategy. Perhaps due to the escalating conflicts in the Middle East, market participants broke the eight-day positive streak on Tuesday, with total net outflows worth $242.6 million. Wednesday and Thursday were also painful for the ETFs, with $64.4 million and $54.2 million leaving them, respectively. Although Monday and Friday registered net outflows worth $61.3 million and $25.6 million, the entire week ended in the red. Overall, $274.3 million was withdrawn from the US-based ETFs. This harmed BTC’s price movements, as the asset tumbled from $66,000 (last Sunday) to $60,000 on Wednesday and Thursday. Despite recovering slightly to $62,000 as of now, the cryptocurrency is still more than 5% down weekly. Ethereum ETFs in the Red, too The spot Ethereum ETFs had a slightly different week but with the same outcome. Monday started with minor outflows of $0.8 million, while Thursday saw $48.6 million taken out. Another $3.2 million was pulled out on Thursday, while investors allocated $19.8 million in net inflows on Wednesday and $7.4 million on Friday. This places the total weekly number at -$25.4 million for the ETH ETFs. Although the net outflows for Ethereum were a lot less than those for the Bitcoin ETFs, ETH’s price has actually declined more. The second-largest digital asset stood close to $2,700 last Sunday, but it dumped by almost $400 mid-week to bottom out at around $2,300 on Thursday. It has recovered to $2,420 now, but it is still more than 8% down weekly.

Most alts have performed in a similar fashion since Friday, but the weekly landscape is quite painful, with several double-digit losers. BTC Stalls at $62K It’s safe to say that it wasn’t a good week for the primary cryptocurrency. It stood above $66,000 last Sunday but its troubles began as soon as Monday with a nosedive to $63,000. The situation worsened mid-week amid the escalating tension in the Middle East. This culminated on Wednesday and Thursday with a few price dips below the coveted $60,000 level. Nevertheless, the bulls managed to defend that level and pushed bitcoin north. Since that multi-week low on Thursday, the cryptocurrency has regained about two grand and now stands around $62,000. Its movements during the weekend have been quite dull. Still, bitcoin is down by more than 5% in the past week. This means that its market dominance has plunged from over $1.3 trillion to $1.225 trillion now. Its dominance over the alts, though, has increased during the same period to 54.3% on CG. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 06.10.2024. Source: TradingView XRP, DOGE Lead on the Way Down Ripple’s native token was frequently in the news during the week. Although it started positively with a filing for an XRP ETF, the SEC was quick to halt the enthusiasm by filing an appeal against a 2023 court decision about the secondary sales of the asset. This had a dramatic impact on its price as it tumbled by 15% within less than a day from over $0.6 to $0.51. XRP is still down by double digits on a weekly scale, even though it has recovered slightly to $0.53. The other notable losers on a weekly scale from the larger-cap alts include DOGE (-13.7%), ADA (-11.4%), SHIB (-11.4%), DOT (-12.4%), NEAR (-12.2%), and more. The total crypto market cap lost over $150 billion at one point during the week but has regained some traction and is now at $2.250 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

However, the $60K support zone has seemingly held BTC, pushing it back higher toward the 200-day moving average.

Therefore, everything now depends on whether the price will be able to break above $64K or if it will be rejected and pushed further down. Source: TradingView On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Bitcoin Net Realized Profit and Loss (NRPL) Bitcoin’s price has been consolidating for more than six months now, and market participants are still speculating whether the cycle top has formed or whether higher prices will be seen shortly. Analyzing the Bitcoin Net Realized Profit and Loss (NPRL) metric would be beneficial in this situation. The metric measures the net profits or losses investors realize. Positive values are associated with net profits, and negative values show net losses. As evident, while the market has not demonstrated a significant crash yet and has only been moving rangebound, the NRPL has already decreased to levels that were last seen when the price was around $30K, and the bull market was only beginning. Therefore, if other factors do not drastically change, it could be concluded that BTC might be preparing for a new bullish run in the coming months.

In the digital age, financial privacy has become a pressing issue because surveillance is ingrained in all electronic transactions. Each one generates bits that can be aggregated, stored, revisited, abused, funneled and manipulated. Theoretically, 4th and 5th amendments of the U.S. Constitution provide a bulwark against 3rd party transaction interception. But a rule written on a piece of paper is only as relevant as there is will to interpret it or enforce it. A more robust solution must come from a hard technological source. Alongside fixed scarcity to 21 million BTC, the underlying draw of Bitcoin is that its network makes transactions inviolable.  Bitcoin mainnet achieves this through escalating confirmations. The first confirmation means that a transaction is included in the blockchain’s block. All subsequent blocks added embed the transaction further into the chain. By the sixth confirmation, a would-be attacker would have to mine 6 consecutive blocks faster than the rest of the Bitcoin mainnet combined. At this point in time, the energy expenditure (hashrate) necessary for such a feat makes this virtually impossible. This is also the reason why Bitcoin’s proof-of-work is so integral to the underlying value of Bitcoin vs proof-of-stake that is so pushed by Greenpeace.  The rule of 6 confirmations therefore became the de facto standard among developers, miners and exchanges. After that 6th confirmation threshold, a BTC transfer is deemed as “final settlement”, or irreversible. But is a transaction genuinely irreversible if it is not private, therefore vulnerable to seizure by either governments or criminals? First, let’s examine what Bitcoin settlement entails. Understanding Final Settlement in Bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto’s peer-to-peer money transfer system revolves around proof-of-work. Truly revolutionary, it makes it possible for a payment system to work by itself. In other words, to be trusted because it is trustless. From initiating a transaction to making the transaction irreversible, the final settlement process follows multiple steps:  When a user initiates a BTC transaction, it is broadcasted to the Bitcoin network (mainnet) and added in the mempool. Bitcoin miners constitute the network, as they form a new block containing mempool transactions. Each such block references a prior block, forming a blockchain, and a nonce (number used once) as a 32-bit random number. Nonce is the critical proof-of-work element as it alters the input to the cryptographic hash function. Because the latter is deterministic, by having a variable nonce, the output hash is changed. This randomness creates a process of trial and error by which miners have to find a valid hash to add a new block to the chain and receive their compensation.  The difficulty imposed by randomness exerts energy consumption, ensuring that miners did the work (proof-of-work).  Other Bitcoin mainnet nodes then verify the validity of the block that included all the transactions.  As a matter of historical practice and analysis, the 6-block confirmation rule additionally secures the finality of those transactions. Due to network latency, it is possible for another miner to simultaneously find a valid block. In such a scenario of divergence, two blockchain states exist, so the longer chain is recognized by the network as valid, while the competing chain (orphan) is disregarded. This also impedes malicious actors from reorganizing the chain in order to reverse transactions. By how much?  According to the “Practical Settlement Bounds for Proof-of-Work Blockchains” paper by Gaži, Ren and Russell, a 6-block confirmation yields 0.48% settlement error guarantee, while assuming 10 second network latency (delay) and 10% adversarial computation power of the network. While that percentage is exceedingly low under such harsh conditions, it is still not zero, which implies that settlement “finality” is still probabilistic. Rather, it is statistically improbable. And if that is the case, how should Bitcoin settlement be treated? In his paper “Probabilistic Settlement Finality in Proof-of-Work Blockchains: Legal Considerations”, Hossein Nabilou at Amsterdam Law School argues that operational finality should be differentiated from legal finality. But because “institutional mechanisms to deal with the remaining risks of settlement finality require a certain level of centralization in the PoW blockchains”, the solution would have to come from “market-driven mechanisms”. At the time in 2022, the author was pessimistic about their emergence. The Privacy Gap in Bitcoin Transactions Despite the aforementioned cryptographic hash function, and pioneering the very concept of “cryptocurrency”, the crypto part of Bitcoin relates to transaction integrity rather than privacy. Cryptographic hash function, combined with a nonce, makes it extremely difficult to tamper with Bitcoin settlements as it prevents double-spending attempts. This cryptographic security is also critical to the infrastructure behind bitcoin payment processing services, which rely on the immutability of the Bitcoin network to ensure secure and accurate transaction settlements. But by the nature of a self-contained network, Bitcoin incidentally offers pseudo anonymity. That level of privacy is instantly breached once an identity is attached to a Bitcoin address, leaving behind a digital trail. This is what eventually led to the arrest of Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, responsible for the Bitfinex exchange hack in 2016, worth around $4.5 billion in BTC. “In a futile effort to maintain digital anonymity, the defendants laundered stolen funds through a labyrinth of cryptocurrency transactions.” From this perspective, Bitcoin’s cryptographic hash should be understood as a digital signature (ECDSA) to verify authenticity, as all the transactions are visible on the public blockchain. Notwithstanding if financial privacy is constitutional or natural right, does that mean that Bitcoin cannot supply it? What if one finds themselves in a tyrannical country and P2P Bitcoin transfer is the only means of receiving funds? Or more commonly, what if one simply views their personal wealth as something that is not appropriate for public consumption? If a link between one’s Bitcoin possession and identity is established, it is not difficult to see how that would open the doors wide open to violent robberies or kidnapping by criminals. Rightfully, Bitcoin holders view this lack of privacy as a massive liability. Fortunately, viable solutions to enforce Bitcoin’s privacy are on the horizon. Enhancing Privacy: Technologies and Challenges Beyond taking care to never link identity to Bitcoin address, or re-using a single address for multiple payments, how can a public blockchain provide financial privacy?  The first answer is to upgrade Bitcoin core. This already happened when the Taproot upgrade was activated in November 2021, at block height 709,632. As a soft fork, Taproot had large support among miners, so it was not as controversial as SegWith in 2017, which resulted in the hard fork of Bitcoin Cash. Taproot can mask multi-signature transactions, which prior to the upgrade were distinguishable from common single-signature ones. Taproot’s Schnorr signature aggregation combines multiple signatures into a single one, making it difficult to determine all the parties involved with the transaction. This also reduces precious blockchain data, removing the bloat and removing data to analyze at the same time.  Moreover, Taproot introduced MAST (Merklized Abstract Syntax Tree), allowing for more complex transactions with conditions:  John receives 5 BTC from Allen if house renovation work is completed within 3 days. But John doesn’t have access to the entire 5 BTC, but only to 3 BTC as mutual understanding. If 3 BTC are spent on renovation, but the work is not completed on time, Allen gets back his 2 BTC.  Such timelocked conditionals are made possible with Taproot’s MAST. Just like Schnorr, MAST reduced the size of this information via hash, therefore reducing the size of traceable information. If certain conditions are not met, including other parties required for signatures, this information would never be revealed. It is easy to see how MAST could be used in betting markets, day trading powered by AI, wherein only the executed conditions are revealed on the blockchain, thus hiding bettor strategies and intentions. Similarly, MAST could be used to automate payments without intermediaries.  Beyond the Taproot upgrade, Lightning Network is the most popular layer 2 scaling solution for Bitcoin. LN’s main purpose is to make BTC transfers at negligible fees by batching transactions off-chain, reducing payment data visible on the Bitcoin mainnet. This could be further amplified if LN’s payment channel is done through onion routing. Unfortunately, this kind of approach is too complex for the average user, on top of the slowdown of settlements due to added network latency. In turn, this would add another uncertainty to settlement finality. A more attractive solution to enhance Bitcoin privacy comes from Silent Payments, as a potential Bitcoin Core upgrade.   Presently under Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 0352, Silent Payments protocol blends BTC transactions, so they can’t be distinguished. It works by a receiver having a unique one-time static address (reusable payment code or “stealth address”), generated when the sender’s wallet combines three keys. This way, no payments would be ever linked to the same sender and transactions are unlinkable to this static address. For on-chain observers, the use of Silent Payments would not be visible or who owns the address. More importantly, the Silent Payments protocol does add data burden to existing Bitcoin protocol, making it scalable.  Contrasted to similar privacy-oriented PayNyms (BIP47), BIP352 doesn’t require users to send fee-burdened two transactions (the first must come as notification) for a single payment. Likewise, BIP352 would not broadcast which wallets linked to a reusable payment code, while BIP47 would only obscure it. The Path to True Final Settlement Privacy coins like Monero (XMR) have largely dropped off the public spotlight. Once the EU proposed and enacted MiCA, it didn’t take other countries to follow suit, including Dubai. Likewise, major exchanges delisted privacy coins, from Kraken and Huobi to Binance and OKX. In turn, users no longer have access to fiat off/on ramps, while also unable to use privacy coins in stores. This is an important lesson. Although governments cannot technically ban cryptocurrencies, they can do so quite effectively by deplatforming. Based on these moves, it is clear that many governments view financial privacy as something outside natural human rights. Bitcoin is exempt from this because its proof-of-work network has always been transparent. But now that Bitcoin has been mainstreamed and institutionalized via Bitcoin ETFs, is it time for Bitcoin’s true final settlement – upgrading Bitcoin Core privacy beyond Taproot? This would align with the standard perception of physical cash, as an inherently anonymous asset despite its central banking origin. Five US Senators have already introduced a bill to ban central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), indicating their preference for financial privacy. At the end of the line, Bitcoin will have to grow to a greater market cap, becoming an indispensable commodity. And when the timing is right, it would be more costlier to deplatform it than it would be to allow its next privacy upgrade to take root.

After three consecutive days of outflows, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a robust rebound on Friday, attracting $25.6 million. Bitwise’s BITB led with $15.3 million in fresh inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC, which added $13.6 million. This influx pushed total assets under management for Bitcoin ETFs to $57.7 billion, representing 4.7% of the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization. Ethereum funds also experienced positive momentum, with spot ETFs pulling in $7.4 million, mainly driven by BlackRock’s ETHA, which secured $14.7 million. While Grayscale’s ETHE saw outflows of $8.2 million, the cumulative net total since July remains slightly negative. Despite mixed results, these inflows reflect investor optimism in a potential market rally. The resurgence of interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs suggests that institutional investors are increasingly confident in the market’s long-term prospects. With Bitcoin ETFs nearing $18.5 billion in net inflows since January, the coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether this momentum can translate into a broader bull run for the cryptocurrency market. Adoption of Bitcoin Cash Increases in “Bitcoin Cash City” Over 200 retailers in Townsville, Australia, often known as “Bitcoin Cash City,” are taking Bitcoin Cash (BCH) payments, indicating a large acceptance of BCH.  The quick and affordable transactions provided by the point-of-sale (POS) register software and the Bitcoin.com Wallet app contribute to this rise.  Bitcoin Jason, a local supporter of BCH, attributes the apps’ increased growth to their user-friendliness and text-to-BCH feature. The merchant network has expanded to include industries like cafes, restaurants, and travel services. Due to its low costs and quick transactions, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) may become increasingly popular, which could lead to competition with Bitcoin (BTC).  Even while BCH is becoming increasingly involved in everyday transactions, BTC’s market dominance and reputation as “digital gold” make it a better store of value. Grammy Award-Winning Rapper Logic’s $6 Million Bitcoin Investment: The Grammy-nominated rapper Logic, real name Robert Bryson Hall II, gained notoriety in November 2020 when he made a $6 million Bitcoin investment.  He received roughly 336.75 BTC at that time, when the price of Bitcoin was $17,817. Logic has made an astounding 238% return on his investment, with Bitcoin currently valued at over $60,228.  Grammy-Nominated Rapper Logic Invested $6M In Bitcoin Nearly 4 Years Ago: This Is How Much His Stash Would Be Worth Today https://t.co/uVJpIesGv6— Maxx Paine (@otpyrc619) October 5, 2024  With a hilarious comment like “F*** it,YOLO” Logic announced his investment on Instagram. He was urged to take the step by Chris Zarou, his manager.  Because of Logic’s success story, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are receiving increasing attention from prominent people and individual investors alike, indicating their potential as long-term investments.  Prominent endorsements such as this maintain Bitcoin’s legitimacy and could encourage additional adoption, which would raise the price of BTC. Robert Kiyosaki Warns of World War III: “Are You Prepared?” Concerns about the potential for World War III have been expressed by Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki in response to growing global tensions. Is this the beginning of World War II?  Kiyosaki posed this question in a recent post on X (previously Twitter) after learning that Israel had launched F-35 fighter jets to target Iran.  Are you ready? Implying that ineffective leaders fuel these disputes, he underlined the need for more robust global leadership.  WWIIIIsrael just launched F35 to bomb Iran.Is this the start of WWIII?Are you prepared?This is what happens when we have weak leaders such as Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.As Jordan Peterson stated:  “If you think tough leaders are bad…wait til you see the damage weak…— Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) October 5, 2024  Not for the first time, Kiyosaki has warned of the potential for worldwide violence resulting from energy crises such as the one caused by the Nord Stream sabotage. He is concerned about the growing national debt of the United States, inflation, and the depreciating value of the dollar. Bitcoin might gain as a safe-haven asset if geopolitical tensions increase. In the past, investors have resorted to decentralized assets such as Bitcoin to shield their capital from economic volatility during periods of unrest and uncertainty.  When tensions escalate, there may be a surge in demand for and price growth for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Price Outlook  Bitcoin is consolidating around the $62,000 level after a brief rally. The cryptocurrency is trading in a tightening range, forming a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 2-hour chart.  This technical setup suggests a potential breakout in either direction, depending on market momentum.   #Bitcoin is consolidating around $62,000, forming a symmetrical triangle pattern. A breakout above $62,475 could spark bullish momentum, while a dip below $61,800 may lead to more downside. Keep an eye on key levels as market awaits economic data!  #Crypto #BTC pic.twitter.com/hFG8dxcGQ7— Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 6, 2024  A break above the immediate resistance at $62,475 could expose Bitcoin to the next resistance at $63,040, with a further upside target at $63,665.  However, if BTC falls below the immediate support at $61,800, it could dip towards $61,210 or even $60,740.  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 53, indicating neutral momentum, while the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $61,990 suggests minor support. Overall, Bitcoin remains in a wait-and-see mode as traders look for a directional cue. The upcoming U.S. economic data releases, including the CPI and unemployment claims, may act as catalysts for a breakout. Conclusion: A break above $62,475 will signal bullish momentum, while a drop below $61,800 could drive sharp selling pressure.

Bitcoin Magazine,A Trump Presidency Is The Best Outcome For Bitcoin: NIKOLAUS,"Mon, 07 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/a-trump-presidency-is-the-best-outcome-for-bitcoin,Trump would allow a friendly regulatory environment for Bitcoiners to thrive in.,"  Follow Nikolaus On X Here  The other week, I made my opinion clear that I believe Donald Trump is the best candidate for Bitcoin in the upcoming 2024 presidential election. Aaron responded, and after reading it, I feel he’s still missing the bigger picture. Aaron’s main points seem to be that Trump is just using Bitcoiners for their votes, and that he won’t follow through on his promises. While I partly agree with the former point, I disagree with the latter. Contrary to what I’ve seen some Bitcoiners online say, I do not think Trump has to be a hardcore Bitcoin maximalist and cypherpunk to be a great Bitcoin president. Here’s why.Trump needs all the votes he can get. Of course he is going to try and appeal to our voters, especially when most of us already have right-leaning political views. It makes sense for the Republican party to adopt freedom money, given they lean more towards the principles of freedom now, while the Democrats have become more authoritarian. Voting for Trump, then, is a win-win. He gets more votes (some in critical swing states), and we get a better environment for our industry. Sounds like a good trade to me.And that leads me into what I disagree with Aaron on. I believe that Trump will keep most, if not all of his promises he’s made when it’s come to Bitcoin. Because, well, most of the promises he has made seem like relatively easy things to implement. It’s not like he’s alone on the issue – there are now many pro-Bitcoin senators and congresspeople to hold him accountable. There’s Senator Cynthis Lummis, who wants to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve (using BTC already owned by the government). There is Congressman Tom Emmer, who already wants to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler and appoint someone better for the industry. You can go to StandWithCrypto.com to see the rest.If elected, Trump would have loads of other, arguably more important issues on his plate to deal with. The fact that his policies would give Bitcoiners a friendly regulatory environment to build in, stop anti-Bitcoin politicians from continuing to attack this industry, all without Trump meddling in it, sounds like the perfect storm for innovation.The fact that he’s done things like bring Bitcoin miners to Mar-a-Lago to better understand the industry is enough evidence to make this point.I think many are overly critical of Trump because he said he wasn’t a fan of Bitcoin in 2019. But that was ages ago, and everything has changed since then. It doesn’t make sense to hate on people for coming around to Bitcoin after not being a fan of it. (I do, however, think it is ok to be critical of the non-Bitcoin initiatives Trump has promoted, like World Liberty Financial, but even that isn’t worth losing all the benefits of his presidency.)So, why would Trump free Ross now when he already had the chance to last term?In politics, as in Bitcoin, it’s all about incentives, and the incentives here are aligned.This article is a Take.

The latest stash is worth around $6.7 million. Metaplanet Expands Bitcoin Holdings According to the official statement released on Monday, Metaplanet – often referred to as Japan’s MicroStrategy – now holds 639.503 BTC, with a current market value of around $40.6 million. The firm disclosed that it acquired the additional bitcoins at an average price of 9.19 million yen ($61,880) per coin, while its total bitcoin purchases averaged 9.32 million yen ($62,790) per bitcoin. The Japanese company has ramped up its bitcoin purchases over the past few months. In May, it declared that it was adopting the cryptocurrency as a key part of its treasury reserve strategy. Last week, it announced the acquisition of another 107.913 BTC, worth approximately 1 billion yen ($6.9 million). Data compiled by Google Finance revealed that the firm’s stock price jumped over 12% following the announcement on October 7th, peaking at 1,045 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, but later declining to 988 yen. Metaplanet announced in August that it had obtained a 1 billion yen (worth around $6.8 million) loan from shareholder MMXX Ventures to boost its Bitcoin reserves. The loan features a 0.1% annual interest rate and a six-month term, beginning August 8, with repayment in a single lump sum. If the company uses the full loan amount for Bitcoin, it could purchase approximately 118.5 BTC at current prices. Metaplanet’s Strategic Options Sale Metaplanet also recently announced that it had sold 223 bitcoin put option contracts with a strike price of $62,000 and a maturity date of December 27. The deal was made with Singapore-based digital asset trading firm QCP Capital as the counterparty. The announcement revealed that Metaplanet received a premium of 23.972 BTC ($1.44 million). Metaplanet provided $13.826 million in collateral and received a 0.1075 BTC premium per contract upfront. The transaction yielded a nominal return of 10.75% and an annualized return of 45.63%.

He remarked: “Too realistic. Or maybe this gang isn’t smart enough.” Xian’s remark hints that the drainer team may have misunderstood or underestimated the potential of the TON blockchain. TON phishing The TON blockchain has been one of 2024’s major success stories. The network’s native token value has surged by more than 100% on the year-to-date metrics, pushing it into the top 10 digital assets by market capitalization. The network’s success can be attributed to the popularity of games like Hamster Kombat, which have boosted the platform’s usage. In addition, the network’s integration with the social messaging application Telegram, which has more than 900 million users, further positions TON as a potential driver of mass crypto adoption. However, earlier this year, reports revealed that TON had become a growing target for phishing attacks.  Interestingly, security firm BlockAid pointed out that attackers have employed multi-chain drainer kits previously used on Ethereum and Solana. Over 300 malicious decentralized apps (dApps) were launched on TON in September alone, highlighting the escalating threats. Target Bitcoin users Meanwhile, the unnamed wallet drainer urged users to shift their attention to Bitcoin, the flagship digital asset. In the message, the hackers stated that those who enjoyed draining on TON would also find targeting Bitcoin appealing. CertiK, another prominent blockchain security company, recently emphasized that malicious actors are increasingly drawn to Bitcoin due to its high transaction volumes, large user base, and substantial total value locked (TVL). Phishing attacks on Bitcoin holders have risen sharply in the past few months. One of the most notable incidents involved a $238 million attack on a Bitcoin whale, further underscoring the mounting risks in the space.

In August, Metaplanet unveiled its intention to raise ¥10.08 billion (approximately $70 million) by offering its 11th series of stock acquisition rights to all common shareholders. The offer provides one stock acquisition right per share, with an option to buy shares at ¥555 (~$4) between Sept. 6 and Oct. 15. LeClair confirmed that the company has already exercised some of these rights, contributing to its recent Bitcoin purchasing spree. The balance would be used to acquire the flagship digital asset before the end of this year. Market analysts noted that this acquisition strategy aligns with Metaplanet’s goal of holding 1,000 BTC in total.  If successful, the firm will become Asia’s largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder, overtaking Hong Kong’s Meitu Inc., which holds 940.9 BTC, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data.

Crypto News,Arrington Capital-Backed RedStone Launches Bitcoin Staking Oracles,"Mon, 07 Oct 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/redstone-launches-bitcoin-staking-oracles/,"Redstone introduces Bitcoin staking oracles to enhance DeFi platforms by offering real-time data on staked Bitcoin and liquid staking tokens (LSTs). Compatible with Ethereum, Avalanche, and Polygon, this service tracks LST issuance and enables cross-chain insights for decentralized finance.The postArrington Capital-Backed RedStone Launches Bitcoin Staking Oraclesappeared first onCryptonews."," Arrington Capital-backed RedStone has launched Bitcoin staking oracles on Monday to enhance DeFi protocols on platforms like Ethereum, Avalanche, and Polygon. This will enable Bitcoin holders to stake their assets in decentralized finance (DeFi) by delivering real-time data for liquid staking. In July, RedStone raised $15 million in a funding round led by Arrington Capital, supporting its expansion efforts.  The firm provides data feeds to blockchains and layer 2 technologies compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). RedStone Bitcoin Staking Oracles Offer Real-Time Data on Staked BTC RedStone’s Bitcoin staking oracles deliver up-to-the-minute data on staked Bitcoin and liquid staking tokens (LSTs).  These oracles track the amount of Bitcoin staked, monitor LST issuance on Ethereum, and calculate the net asset value of these tokens in real time. LSTs (liquid staking tokens) are utility tokens issued during network staking processes. For example, the stETH token is issued by Lido when staking ETH on Ethereum. In addition to tracking staked Bitcoin, RedStone’s oracles monitor LST issuance on Ethereum, offering seamless support across DeFi platforms. Cross-Chain Data Feeds Deliver Real-Time Staking Insights Looking ahead, RedStone plans to integrate its Bitcoin staking oracles with platforms such as pumpBTC and Solv, with further support for Arbitrum, Base, and BNB Chain. RedStone’s CEO Jakub Wojciechowski stated, “As Bitcoin staking grows, we’ll continue expanding our data services to support its increasing demands.” RedStone’s Bitcoin staking oracles will also deliver data services for Bitcoin and Ethereum interactions across leading DeFi platforms like Morpho, Gearbox, Pendle, and ZeroLend, further solidifying its presence in decentralized finance.

Crypto News,"Bitcoin Tops 2024 Asset Performance Despite Weak Q3, Says NYDIG","Mon, 07 Oct 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-tops-2024-asset-performance-despite-weak-q3-says-nydig/,"Bitcoin remains the top-performing asset of 2024, even after navigating a “seasonally weak” third quarter, according to a report from the New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG).The postBitcoin Tops 2024 Asset Performance Despite Weak Q3, Says NYDIGappeared first onCryptonews."," Bitcoin remains the top-performing asset of 2024, even after navigating a “seasonally weak” third quarter, according to a report from the New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG). Despite a modest 2.5% gain over the quarter, the cryptocurrency managed to recover from its previous decline in the second quarter, though it faced considerable selling pressure throughout the period, noted NYDIG’s head of research, Greg Cipolaro, in an October 4 report. “Bitcoin is still the best-performing asset class in 2024, but its lead has narrowed,” Cipolaro stated, highlighting a year-to-date increase of 49.2%. Bitcoin Faces Several Headwinds While Bitcoin’s performance remains strong, it faced challenges from several headwinds, including creditor distributions from the Mt. Gox exchange and Genesis, totaling nearly $13.5 billion. Additionally, significant sales of Bitcoin by the United States and German governments contributed to the market pressure, Cipolaro explained. Amid this turbulence, other asset classes like precious metals and certain equity sectors have also posted gains, narrowing the gap between their performance and that of Bitcoin. “Most asset classes have had a banner year,” Cipolaro noted, emphasizing that Bitcoin’s lead, while still present, has diminished as the broader market has also seen growth. Despite a typically bearish trend for Bitcoin in September, the digital asset managed a 10% gain during the month, defying seasonal expectations. This resilience was partly driven by growing demand for U.S. spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which accumulated $4.3 billion in inflows throughout the quarter.  NYDIG: Bitcoin remains the best-performing asset so far this year with a year-to-date gain of 49.2%. The upcoming US election on Nov. 5 will play a big part in market performance for Q4, and expects larger gains if Trump wins. Q4 is traditionally a bullish period for BTC and… pic.twitter.com/8jYmktA116— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 7, 2024  Moreover, increased corporate interest in Bitcoin, notably from companies like MicroStrategy and crypto miner Marathon Digital, added to the upward momentum. Cipolaro also pointed out that Bitcoin’s rolling 90-day correlation with U.S. stocks rose during the third quarter, ending the period at 0.46. However, he emphasized that the correlation remains relatively low, suggesting that Bitcoin still offers substantial diversification benefits for multi-asset portfolios. “While Bitcoin’s correlation with equities rose, the most recent level is still low, implying that Bitcoin offers significant diversification benefits to multi-asset portfolios,” he said. The broader crypto market received a boost towards the end of Q3, driven by key political developments. These included former President Donald Trump’s endorsement of the cryptocurrency industry, monetary easing measures by the Federal Reserve, and stimulus efforts from China’s central bank, which aimed to increase liquidity. According to Cipolaro, these factors helped buoy sentiment within the market. Upcoming Presidential Election to Influence Markets Looking ahead, Cipolaro highlighted the potential impact of the upcoming U.S. presidential election on November 5, which he believes could significantly influence market dynamics in the fourth quarter. He suggested that a victory for Trump might drive larger gains for the crypto market. “While both candidates will be improvements over the Biden administration regarding their attitude towards crypto, Trump, if he wins, will deliver bigger gains for the asset class given his full-throated endorsement of the industry,” Cipolaro wrote. He concluded by noting that Q4 is traditionally a bullish period for Bitcoin, with several factors potentially aligning to support further gains.

Bitcoin Magazine,HBO's Satoshi Documentary 'Money Electric' Is An Insult to Bitcoin ,"Wed, 09 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/money-electric-insult-bitcoin-cynical-stupid-dangerous,It’s hard to know what to say about this documentary except that it’s both a marvel of creativity and cynicism.,"CAUTION: SPOILERS AHEAD.Some say we live in the golden age of documentaries – certainly they are being created at a volume far higher than at any point in history, but for every “My Octopus Teacher,” a genuinely inspiring and unusual human story, there’s the opposite: cynical trash like “Money Electric.”   Let’s start by acknowledging that “Money Electric” upped its own stakes, mounting a week-long hype cycle with the promise of a big reveal – that the world would at last know the identity of Bitcoin’s anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.Maybe let’s also put aside the historical baggage there. Sure, many journalists have died on this hill, but surely “Money Electric” might have something to add to the conversation? After all, from the trailer, they seemingly spent millions of dollars paying for Samson Mow’s dinners as he evangelized Bitcoin around the world. (It’s always great to subsidize education!)There were even hints that maybe there would be something inspired here, a still shot showing a progression of cypherpunks, all of whom have interesting stories. Maybe the “big reveal” was just a ruse to keep our attention, and maybe there’d be a series of reveals (none taken too seriously) that added up to a compelling story about what Bitcoin is and could be.Sadly, not. For most of its runtime, “Money Electric” hides its motives, following its star (director Cullen Hoback) as he dives into the Bitcoin world. But it’s clear as the film unfolds that the creators had no other motive than outing someone as Satoshi.How else does a big budget film end up indulging in straight conspiracy theory, dredging up the alternative history of the “Block Size Wars” as a way to introduce accusations that are almost entirely uninteresting? Hint: The impetus for the big reveal here is that Peter Todd may have worked with a covert government agent to promote his ideas for the Bitcoin roadmap. It’s here where things go off the rails (or start going to the master plan). After making us suffer his own misdirection, Hoback and Co. finally play their cards, unearthing a series of purported evidences that show Adam Back and Peter Todd (as well as Greg Maxwell for some reason) were all secretly Satoshi. Truly, the most banal and oft-repeated of theories. From there, we see a series of “gotchas” that would have all been easily disproved if the directors did basic follow-up research.Let’s review:Peter Todd and Adam Back corresponded on the cryptography mailing list when he was young. This is true, and widely known. It’s something Peter and Adam comment on publicly and doesn’t really say much of anything, besides the fact that the cryptography list was open to the public, and included possibly hundreds of members.Peter Todd’s first BitcoinTalk post occurred around the time Satoshi left – Again, another known. In fact, the post is written in Todd’s snarky style, but we’re supposed to believe this was him misremembering that he was actually Satoshi and responding to himself. (Or so the director thinks). Nevermind that his forum name at the time was “retep,” and being that no one knew who he was, he could have easily deleted it.Peter Todd once made a joke about deleting Bitcoin. This is used to support the idea that he burned Satoshi’s keys. Adam Back discussed Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list after Bitcoin was launched – Giving credit where credit is due, this is also something I didn’t actually know. But again, once looking at the archive we can see the material supports Back’s claim he wasn’t yet interested in Bitcoin. In the emails, Back is passively reacting to the hype around Bitcoin (then surging above $30), and there’s even a reply where he makes a complaint about why Satoshi (whose name he misspelled) didn’t add some feature he thought would be beneficial. Again, 5 minutes of Googling.Todd and Back were in cahoots, involved in a cover-up to mask the fact that they created Bitcoin. Ta-da. That’s why he never joined Blockstream! (Seriously this is stated, actually, by the director in the film.)Taking a step back, it’s hard to know what to say about this sequence except that it’s both a marvel of creativity and cynicism, and in saying this, know that’s in no way a compliment. To start, Hoback makes no legitimate attempt to engage Back or Todd on his finding. He merely presents the material as he found it, films them reacting, and closes up shop. It makes sense, even someone like me will admit there’s a non-zero chance Back or Todd was Satoshi. There aren’t many people you can’t rule out entirely, and they are among them.Sadly, a non-zero chance is not a smoking gun. It’s not proof.Todd and Back’s internet presence, while removed from the web, is accessible. I’ve read it. No, they weren’t the only ones involved in digital cash who erased things. Of course, with the Magic of editing, and by exposing the “findings” to no criticism, I’m sure many viewers will walk away thinking they’ve been shown a clever and well-researched theory.All Hoback proved to me is that he understands the shortcuts you can take when making a documentary. It alone among creative works allows you to hide all your errors behind editing, while making baseless and dangerous accusations seem plausible.And to be clear, claiming that someone is Satoshi without evidence is exactly that.Let’s hope no one gets hurt because of his idiocy.Note: I interviewed a producer for “Electric Money” at one point in 2021. It was not recorded. I had no subsequent contact with the documentary team."
Bitcoin Magazine,Asian Bitcoiners Are Profit Maximalists,"Wed, 09 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/asian-bitcoiners-are-profit-maximalists,"As someone who's lived in both Asia and the West, I've noticed clear differences in how each views Bitcoin - with Asia as profit maximalists and the West being more philosophically driven.","WHAT WE’RE READING: Blockspace Media      A recent Blockspace article deeply resonated with me as someone who's lived in Asia and the West. It examined how Asia-based Bitcoiners are mostly profit maximalists, not philosophically driven Bitcoin maxis.This rang true from my experience. When I meet Asian Bitcoiners, money and profit seem to be the primary motivators. Contrast that to Westerners, who often cite the cypherpunk, privacy, and political ideals behind Bitcoin.Of course, this is a broad generalization. Many exceptions exist across both continents, but the general lens is that each side’s views on Bitcoin differ substantially.Cultural and economic differences likely drive this divide. Western Bitcoiners are often born into prosperity with strong infrastructure. Money itself doesn't captivate them, as it's abundantly available. Thus, they have the luxury of prioritizing loftier Bitcoin goals like privacy, censorship resistance, and decentralization.Meanwhile, many Asian Bitcoiners grew up poor, struggling for money amidst crumbling infrastructure. When they discover Bitcoin, it understandably represents financial opportunity above all else. After lacking money their whole lives, profits take precedence over philosophical concerns.A prime example is the common maxi argument against altcoins - that they lose value against Bitcoin over time. This philosophical stance falls flat in Asia where people judge investments based on empirical results measured in fiat gains. If an altcoin generates a 20x fiat return, Asians won't care that it dropped 98% against Bitcoin. Their profit-centric framework renders certain Western philosophical arguments ineffective.You can see the results where Bitcoin maximalism thrives – predominantly in the West. Asia has practically no maxis comparatively. Again, incentives align. When your sole goal is profit maximization, altcoins and tokens become fair game. That's why we are seeing more Bitcoin season 2 projects emerging from Asia, which will continue to be the case.This isn't to say one mindset is superior. Both are integral to Bitcoin's success. Asian business drive adoption at all costs, and provide the capitalist engine. Western idealism keeps the protocol ethos on track. Together they produce the checks and balances Bitcoin needs to thrive.Observing Asia's profit-first mentality versus the West's ideological leanings provides insight into Bitcoin's cultural landscape. Neither outlook is right or wrong per se. By understanding both mentalities, Bitcoin can synthesize the best of both worlds.This article is a Take. Opinions expressed are entirely the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine."

Bitcoin Magazine,I Just Entered the Bitcoin Mining Lottery: NIKOLAUS,"Tue, 08 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/i-just-entered-the-bitcoin-mining-lottery,"How I’m looking to beat the odds and claim a full 3.25 BTC block worth $200,000.","  Follow Nikolaus On X Here  When I first came onto the Bitcoin scene in 2017, I had changed my Twitter (now X) handle to “@nikcantmine.” (It was a joke I thought was funny at the time since I didn’t have the resources to mine BTC in high school.) But today, I officially became “nik CAN mine”.The other week I got gifted a Bitaxe, a fully open source (and very small) bitcoin miner, while attending the Human Rights Foundation’s Bitcoin Summit in Nashville. It’s a pretty neat device that allows you to connect to a mining pool or solo mine on your own. nik CAN mine pic.twitter.com/Mv1OuTyvBM— Nikolaus (@nikcantmine) October 8, 2024  Setting up the device was fairly easy. Tinkering with it was fun and having the ability to hold a miner in the palm of my hand felt pretty cypherpunk. It feels like a cool way to introduce someone to mining on a very small scale.Of course, by connecting this miner to a pool, I wouldn’t stand to gain any real profit, as this miner is negligible compared to what power is actually needed today to profitably mine BTC today. But solo mining with this machine is where things get a bit interesting. Earlier this summer, a Bitaxe solo miner actually beat the odds and mined a solo block, earning the block reward of 3.25 BTC currently worth over $205,000.Congratulations to miner with the first bitaxe block, only a tiny 3TH for finding the 290th solo block on solo ckpool! This much hashrate only would find a block once every 3500 YEARS on average, or 1 in 1.2 MILLION chance per day! https://t.co/5Wtu9jydsF pic.twitter.com/D5sSzug42P— Dr -ck (@ckpooldev) July 24, 2024  Data shows this miner had mined consistently with 500Gh/s worth of hashrate for weeks, and then had increased its hashrate up to 3TH right before the block was found. Which somewhat encourages me knowing that my Bitaxe is currently mining at over 634Gh/s.But I’m not getting my hopes up, considering I don’t have more hashrate to add and the odds of finding a block with this little hash rate is around 1 in 1.2 million per day, according to the Solo Ckpool admin, Dr -ck.   My solo mining stats  Still, I got this machine for free, so I thought why not plug it in and see what happens? I’ll deal with the power bill later when I see how much it is, and re-evaluate if this is worth it to keep running. Having used it, I probably wouldn’t purchase one based on the economics of it alone, since I wouldn’t be able to make my money back unless I hit the lottery. But I would maybe purchase one just to have as a fun toy.The odds of me finding a block is 0.001% per day, but it honestly just feels fun to have running in hopes of finding a solo block. I can keep my Bitaxe running 24/7 if I want to, since it only requires a 5-volt power cord plugged into a normal electrical socket to operate. I’ve got it set up right here on my desk next to my monitor.  Odds of me finding a block based on my current hashrate  Together with a new Coldcard Q I just got, I couldn’t stop thinking about how cool it would be to win a solo block mining with this and have that BTC reward sent to a brand new bitcoin wallet. This would mean there is no public record of me receiving either the Bitaxe or Coldcard (apart from this article), and I’d have some sweet KYC-free Bitcoin. This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Vexl: The Next Generation Bitcoin P2P Trading App,"Tue, 08 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/vexl-the-next-generation-bitcoin-p2p-trading-app,Vexl co-founder and CEO Lea Petrášová believes that the app she’s helped create — an open-source and KYC-free peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplace — is essential in helping to preserve Bitcoin’s most essential qualities. ,"Company Name: VexlFounders: Lea Petrášová, Marek Palatinus and Pavol RusnakDate Founded: June 2022Location of Headquarters: Prague, Czech RepublicAmount of Bitcoin Held in Treasury: The majority of the treasury is bitcoinNumber of Employees: 5 full-time employees and 5 part-time employees/volunteersWebsite: https://vexl.it/Public or Private? PrivateLea Petrášová is a cypherpunk at heart with over 10 years of experience in the world of software development.This made her a perfect candidate to help create Vexl, an open-source app that enables users to conduct private peer-to-peer bitcoin transactions in a relatively easy manner.With Vexl, Petrášová and the team from SatoshiLabs (well-known for creating Trezor hardware wallets) created what Petrášová terms a “social network” that connects buyers and sellers of bitcoin via the contacts in their phone as well as the contacts of their contacts. What is more, the communication between users is private, and Vexl doesn’t charge for the service it provides.Petrášová and the team at Vexl are on a mission to enable people to use Bitcoin the way it was intended to be used — without KYC, privately and without third-party intermediaries involved in the process.We spoke with Petrášová to get more details on Vexl’s mission.Frank Corva: Please tell us about Vexl’s mission.Lea Petrášová: We believe that without the freedom to transact, we have no other rights. Bitcoin gives us the ultimate entry ticket to a financial system that is not inherently exploitative and oppressive.However, for it to serve this purpose, it cannot be tied to one's identity. We provide our users with an option to buy or sell bitcoin peer-to-peer without KYC, in a way that is not only private, but also accessible, user-friendly, and secure.Corva: What were you doing before Vexl?Petrášová: I used to be a project manager for a small venture fund that also operated as a software house. In 2018, I launched a spin-off focused exclusively on web3 development, particularly in DeFi. While the projects were academically interesting, after selling the company, I realized I wanted to dedicate my time and energy solely to Bitcoin.Corva: How did the idea for Vexl come about and how did you get involved?Petrášová: This idea had actually been brewing in Slush's (co-founder of SatoshiLabs, Trezor, Vexl) mind for a few years. As one of the industry's OGs, he anticipated the regulations long before they came into effect.When he found out I had recently wrapped up my previous job, he reached out and pitched what would later become Vexl, essentially offering me the opportunity to take on the executive management of the project. I didn’t hesitate for a second.Corva: Vexl seems to embrace much of the bitcoin ethos. It’s an app that allows for peer-to-peer trading, it doesn’t require much KYC and it’s open-source. Why was it important for you to design it this way?Petrášová: We're not just Bitcoiners; we're also cypherpunks and activists.When we came up with Vexl, we were solving our own problem: how to buy or sell Bitcoin without KYC, outrageous fees, or significant security and safety risks. We couldn't design a product we wouldn't be willing to use ourselves. There was never any debate about the nature of the software—we knew from day one it had to be open source, KYC-free, and peer-to-peer. However, we spent a lot of time researching and balancing the ""trilemma"" of usability, security, and privacy.Corva: What has it been like to work with Pavol Rusnák, a legend in the bitcoin/crypto wallet space?Petrášová: Humbling. He’s the kind of thinker you can ask any question, and he’ll respond with an original answer. The range of his knowledge and interests is deeply impressive. Yet, he approaches people and projects with kindness, respect, and most importantly, a great sense of humor. He’s truly inspiring.Corva: You don’t plan to monetize Vexl. Why?Petrášová: We strongly believe in the importance of our mission and are committed to making it as accessible as possible.Corva: How will Vexl continue to exist if you don’t monetize it?Petrášová: We rely directly on donations and grants. I have deep gratitude and mad respect for everyone who has helped us make Vexl a success. But thanks to open source, if, for any reason, we were to fail, I want to believe that someone else would pick up where we left off and keep things moving forward.Corva: Vexl is essentially a messaging app, something that connects buyers and sellers to transact between themselves much like LocalBitcoins did. Why did you create something like this right now?Petrášová: Because we clearly saw the need. Think about it — Bitcoin is currently the 6th largest monetary asset, aspiring to become a global, universal store of value.Governments, through various third parties and financial institutions, can create registries of bitcoin holders. These individuals could then be censored, prosecuted, taxed, and have their ownership controlled, compromised, or even outlawed.Knowing the identities of Bitcoin users weakens Bitcoin's ability to function as a store of value independent of state power. That was the first part of our motivation. The second part of our motivation was much more practical: Every time I orange-pilled someone and didn’t want to send them to an exchange, I didn’t have a good alternative. My options were either selling them my own bitcoin or going through a lengthy search to find someone else who could. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a huge fan of platforms like LocalBitcoins. But as someone who has never bought bitcoin with KYC or registered on an exchange, I know firsthand the limitations that come with options like this.Corva: How does Vexl differ from other P2P apps like Hodl Hodl, Bisq and Peach Bitcoin?Petrášová: Well, first of all, we’re a non-profit, so we operate in a completely different space. I don’t see other solutions out there as competing, rather view them as complementary.The real innovation that Vexl introduces is our unique reputation model. On our marketplace, you can only view anonymized offers from your contacts and their contacts. Until both parties decide to reveal their identities, you don’t know who the other person is, but you can always see how many mutual contacts you share and who those people are, and eventually ask them for a reference. This allows you to better assess the individual risk of the counterparty, which is nearly impossible when you're connecting two strangers from opposite sides of the world — not to mention, it can be downright dangerous if you're using a fiat wire transfer for settlement.If you really think about it, we managed to bring a real-world reputation into an app. And this social aspect — human interactions and experience — can’t be replaced by any technology. That’s why on Vexl there is no escrow, no fees, and no need to already have bitcoin in order to join. Lastly, I’m particularly proud of our user experience. While creating Vexl, I kept asking myself, ""Could my aunt use this without a hitch?"" That mindset shaped our UI, and I believe it’s far more user-friendly than anything else out there.Corva: Why does Vexl not push to decentralize its backend?Petrášová: We’re a non-profit with very lean operations. In a team as small as ours, we have to think twice when choosing what to prioritize.While decentralizing the backend is something we’ll focus on in the future, right now our backlog is full of more pressing app improvements.What’s great is that Vexl is already politically decentralized. Anyone who doesn’t want to rely on my decisions can simply take the code and alter it however they see fit.Corva: Why does Vexl ask for phone numbers?Petrášová: If you zoom out, you’ll see that Vexl is, ultimately, a social network. Anyone who has ever tried to build one from scratch will agree that it’s an incredibly difficult task. So, we chose a different route: Why not build on top of an existing network? But then came an even bigger question: Which one?We also wanted something that’s not going away anytime soon and that’s widely adopted across the world. The answer was clear to us: using phone numbers and contact lists. From there we just had to find a way to use them while still keeping them private and secure.Corva: Do you ever see mass adoption of Vexl or do you think the average person will find going to a regulated exchange like Kraken more convenient?Petrášová: Sometimes I get asked what my biggest apprehension is as the CEO of a Bitcoin company, and my answer is always “ignorance.” People often don’t care about financial freedom until it’s too late.That being said, nothing is better marketing for us than the current financial system becoming more and more unbearably unusable and commerce becoming increasingly permissioned. From this perspective, it would be a beautiful world if tools like Vexl became obsolete. But Vexl has been invented, and it cannot be uninvented. Maybe it will be used for peer-to-peer bitcoin transactions. Or it might be used in the gig economy or to pay for goods in bitcoin.Ever since we introduced categories in the marketplace, we’ve seen circular economies booming. I’m building Vexl for everyone who has the courage to claim their financial sovereignty — even if it only serves a small community of users.Corva: Where are you seeing the most adoption for the app thus far? Why do you think people in these regions are adopting it?Petrášová: Most of our users are from the Czech Republic and Slovakia. I think the success has a lot to do with the history of these countries and their economic isolation during communist times. There is a long tradition of people hedging against oppression with stronger currencies and participating in the gray economy. Additionally, the support of SatoshiLabs definitely helped us a lot during the launch, especially in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, where SatoshiLabs is well-known and respected. We also see significant growth in Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland and the UK, mostly scaling through meetups. In recent months, I am really thrilled to see local Vexl initiatives thrive in African countries, as well.Corva: What’s next for Vexl?Petrášová: Over the course of the summer, we managed to successfully rewrite our backend, which had been a major hurdle for future development. This opened up the opportunity for us to introduce a wide variety of improvements to the social network that we had on our roadmap for a long time.Another major focus is providing education about the importance of non-KYC Bitcoin. It’s disturbingly common that users don’t realize the true cost they pay for comfort or convenience when giving up their personal data on financial institutions."
Bitcoin Magazine,SHINOBI: Stop Demonizing Developers Over Nonsense,"Tue, 08 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/shinobi-stop-demonizing-developers-over-nonsense,A quick take on the latest reason people are yelling at Bitcoin Core developers.,"      Recently a big snafu was made about changes to the BIP 85 repository. For those not familiar with the BIP, it's a very simple scheme to allow generating new word seeds from a derivation path in a pre-existing word seed that you have. The logic of the BIP is to enable people who utilize multiple wallets to manage the chaos of having to maintain individual isolated backups for numerous wallets. By generating new seeds based on the entropy of a derivation path, users can simply make a single backup of one “master” word seed, and from there be able to regenerate any child seed from that master one. One backup, and you can have as many independent word seeds as you need. They are even safe to transport around, import into different devices or wallets, and have zero risk of putting the master seed or any coins stored on it at risk. There is cryptographically no way to go backwards from a child seed to the master seed, even if it were compromised. This design makes it very safe to utilize multiple independent seeds/wallets, while streamlining the process of backups to safeguard against loss.The BIP was updated to follow a pull request suggestion clarifying numerous things, but the key alteration was a change to how the actual child keys were generated, ostensibly to follow the specification in BIP 32 (which details how to generate keys using derivation paths in HD wallets) which BIP 85 did not do strictly. This would have resulted in the same BIP 85 paths generating different keys than they did under the current specification. This is a breaking change. If it had been implemented in the new specification by any project, it would not properly generate any old BIP 85 seeds that users had already generated and sent money to. This would mean those funds would be “lost” in the sense that the update wallets would no longer correctly generate keys to get people's money if they had lost a copy of the previously generated seed. The reality is though, that no wallet would have implemented that feature, or if they did, they would have done so in a way to support both methods, because they already have users in the world that have generated seeds using the old specification. Wallets and device makers would not introduce a change that would just break users ability to recover existing funds, it's just not in their best interest. All this incident demonstrated is a lack of communication, nothing more. There was no real risk of anything ripping out to create real world consequences that would have affected users. Projects implementing BIP 85 made no changes, nothing happened except a technical document was changed. It was even reverted to remove the change immediately after public backlash against the nature of the change, and lack of communication between developers and projects actually implementing the BIP. People need to stop blowing up communication failures like this, that have no real consequences, as instances of nefarious intent, or a profound failure of competence. It was simply a mistake, one that can be learned from by improving communication between developers and project maintainers going forward, that caused no real harm to anyone. Blowing up molehills into mountains like this serves no one in this space, and does nothing to improve real problems with communication and coordination in the space. Properly contextualizing in a productive civil way so that people can learn is how to handle these things. "
Bitcoin Magazine,Reminder to Update Your Bitcoin Wallet's Firmware,"Tue, 08 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/upgrade-bitcoin-hardware-wallet-firmware,"Live digital devices, Bitcoin hardware wallets are not infallible. They require some routine upkeep, or at least a well-kept seed phrase.","The smell of fall in the air, this weekend I indulged in apple delicacies, watched the changing leaves, and oh yeah, traveled to make sure my Bitcoin custody is up to date…    If you follow me on X, you know that I hold Bitcoin with Casa, a multisig security provider, and that I use the service to manage a few different multisig vaults for various purposes.This requires keeping a number of keys and wallets up to date, and since I don’t keep any key materials at home, it requires some degree of routine and dedication. I’ve self-custodied my Bitcoin since 2020, and I’ve built up some good habits along the way. That said, something that always strikes me is just how much more nerve-wracking it is than trusted set-ups. One thing that always gives me pause: the firmware update. As I’ve written before, I’m not super technical. My specialty in Bitcoin is history, and while, sure that necessitates that I know about network theory and architecture, there is something about watching digital gears and a loading bar that just makes me super uncomfortable.I say this all because it’s a less-known issue with the Bitcoin hardware wallets most use to self-custody. These devices, termed “signing devices” by Coldcard creator NVK, do just that, they manage your key material, and they sign on your behalf when making a transaction. But, being live digital devices, they’re not infallible. They require some upkeep. All you need to do is to scroll past a few updates of people losing Bitcoin on firmware updates to know the drawbacksIt’s a common problem, and the culprit is always a corrupt hardware device (and a lost back-up). Add that multisig vaults, which require a combination of keys to sign a transaction, aren’t yet the norm, and the number of lost Bitcoin just seems to always be up and to the right.The most common issue – the user doesn’t update their firmware often, waits, and later borks their device, thereafter finding they’ve also misplaced their seed phrase. Here's Andreas explaining firmware updates in more detail, though he doesn't actually update his firmware, he just manages his seed phrase.Suffice to say, it's an example of why the world of self-custody, however improved it is, still makes me uneasy. In my case, I updated my wallets without much of an issue. Only one of the wallets even needed a firmware update, and it was simple. (Taking all of a few minutes to prove my coins are safe).That said, I had to make sure to check my other keys beforehand, and that I had a plurality of the multi-sig keys needed in a worst-case scenario, as well as my seed backups.This is what makes Bitcoin custody such a high-octane process: you can never be too careful. When you’re your own bank, there’s always a chance that something might go wrong.This article is a Take.

In an Oct. 9 note to investors, Hougan outlined the key factors that could influence Bitcoin’s upward trajectory, including the outcome of the US election, economic conditions, and the absence of major disruptions in the crypto space. US elections Hougan suggested that Bitcoin could climb to $80,000 if the upcoming US election results in anything other than a complete Democratic victory. While many view the election as a straightforward choice between pro-crypto Donald Trump and ‘lukewarm’ Kamala Harris, Hougan explained the situation is more complex. According to him, the Democratic party is populated by politicians with differing opinions about the emerging industry, ranging from Senator Elizabeth Warren’s anti-crypto stance to Representative Ritchie Torres’ strong support for the technology. Hougan argued that the Warren wing’s control over policy and key appointments has created a challenging environment for the crypto sector over the past four years. So, if the Democratic party does not win both the White House and Congress, he expects them to take a more neutral stance toward the industry. He stated: “To thrive, bitcoin doesn’t need politicians. It just needs them to get out of the way. And barring a Democratic sweep of both houses of Congress and the White House, I suspect they will, with the Democrats taking a more neutral approach to the industry.” Hougan shared data from the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket showing that the odds of a Democratic sweep are currently at 20%, while a Republican sweep sits at 33%. The platform also shows a 54% chance of Trump winning the presidency, a 73% likelihood of a Republican-controlled Senate, and a 62% probability of a Democratic House. Economic conditions Hougan identified further economic developments as crucial for Bitcoin’s potential rally. He expects two more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve by the end of the year, totaling 50 basis points, alongside additional fiscal stimulus from China. Hougan pointed out that the market is eager for more cuts, and he expects the Federal Reserve to deliver the predicted rate cuts. He wrote: “If it gets both, I suspect we will get our Q4 rally. If we don’t, I think the disappointment could weigh on the market.” Stability in the crypto industry The final factor that could drive Bitcoin past $80,000 this year is stability within the crypto industry. Hougan emphasized the importance of avoiding major surprises, such as significant hacks, new lawsuits, or a flood of previously locked tokens entering the market. He added: “If we can make it through the end of the year without similar shocks, I’d expect new all-time highs and beyond.” ‘Animal spirits’ While Bitcoin’s success doesn’t rely on other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Solana, Hougan noted that broader positive sentiment in the crypto market could boost Bitcoin’s short-term performance. The Bitwise CIO mentioned the potential for Bitcoin to reach $100,000 in a matter of months, especially if “animal spirits”—a term he uses to describe pro-crypto sentiment—sweep through the market. This year, those “animal spirits” have been relatively absent, except for Bitcoin. However, Hougan believes sustained growth in stablecoins and the rise of high-throughput blockchains like Sui, alongside innovative projects like Babylon, could further support Bitcoin’s upward momentum.

Crypto Slate,Bitfinex deemed ‘sole victim’ eligible for recovery of $7.4 billion Bitcoin hack,"Wed, 09 Oct 2024",https://cryptoslate.com/bitfinex-deemed-sole-victim-eligible-for-recovery-of-7-4-billion-bitcoin-hack/,"A new US government filing suggests that Bitfinex may be the sole entity eligible for restitution in connection with the 2016 hack that resulted in the theft of approximately 120,000 BTC.

The document states, “The government is not aware of any person […]The postBitfinex deemed ‘sole victim’ eligible for recovery of $7.4 billion Bitcoin hackappeared first onCryptoSlate.","A new US government filing suggests that Bitfinex may be the sole entity eligible for restitution in connection with the 2016 hack that resulted in the theft of approximately 120,000 BTC. Bitfinex’s LEO token jumped 14% to $6.85 following the release of the documents. The document states,  “The government is not aware of any person who qualifies as a victim under the CVRA or for restitution under the MVRA, beyond perhaps Bitfinex, the Victim Virtual Currency Exchange (‘VICTIM VCE’).”  As reported by court documents, this positions Bitfinex as the primary party affected by the cyberattack. Following the hack, Bitfinex reduced all customer account balances by 36% to distribute the losses incurred. In compensation, the exchange issued BFX tokens to customers, who could sell, redeem, or exchange them. By April 2017, all BFX tokens had been redeemed, with some customers opting to receive shares in Bitfinex’s parent company, iFinex. The filing notes, “iFinex believes that it is the sole victim with sustained financial losses from the hack.” This development indicates that restitution efforts will likely focus on Bitfinex rather than individual account holders, as the exchange has already compensated users through alternative means. Per Bitfinex’s official announcements, the company has been actively collaborating with law enforcement agencies to recover the stolen assets. In February 2022, US authorities seized 94,643 BTC connected to the hack, valued at approximately $3.6 billion at the time. The funds, which may now be returned to Bitfinex following the culmination of this case, are currently worth $5.8 billion. In July 2023, Bitfinex announced receiving $312,219.71 in cash and 6.917 Bitcoin Cash (BCH) from the US Department of Homeland Security as part of ongoing recovery efforts. The exchange has contractual obligations to token holders, specifically those holding Recovery Right Tokens (RRTs) issued after the 2016 incident. Bitfinex will use recovered funds to redeem these RRTs and, after fulfilling these obligations, allocate up to 80% of any remaining assets to UNUS SED LEO token holders. In July 2023 Bitfinex stated, “Under the terms of Bitfinex’s contractual obligations to token holders, these amounts will be used to redeem Recovery Right Tokens (RRTs) issued by Bitfinex following the 2016 security breach. As there are currently 30 million RRTs in circulation, the amount recovered is not sufficient to redeem all RRT tokens. Pursuant to Bitfinex’s contractual commitments, all RRT holders must be redeemed at $1, following which up to 80 percent of any remaining recovered assets will be paid to UNUS SED LEO token holders.” While UNUS SED LEO token holders won’t directly receive recovered Bitcoin, they may benefit indirectly through the token’s burn mechanism and increased value if Bitfinex successfully recovers and utilizes the stolen funds as outlined in their plans. As reported by Bitfinex, the situation involved complex legal proceedings and potential claims from various parties. The determination that Bitfinex is the sole victim for restitution purposes may streamline the legal process, focusing efforts on returning assets to the exchange. The 2016 Bitfinex hack remains one of the largest security breaches in crypto history. At the time, the theft had a significant impact on the market and raised concerns about the security of digital asset exchanges. Bitfinex’s immediate response involved a controversial strategy of socializing the losses by adjusting all customer accounts, which sparked debate within the crypto community. Despite initial criticism, Bitfinex’s approach allowed it to remain operational and eventually compensate its users. The issuance of BFX tokens served as an interim solution, providing customers with a path to recover their funds either through redemption or conversion into equity. By April 2017, the successful redemption of all BFX tokens marked a milestone in the exchange’s recovery efforts. With customers compensated and no other parties identified as victims under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA) or the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA), the focus narrows to the exchange itself. This development may expedite the legal procedures required to return the seized assets. Bitcoin fell slightly by 0.7% as the documents were released, suggesting traders are nervous about billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin coming back into circulation.

This move aimed to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on the US dollar. The initial surge in inflation mirrored the global impact of the pandemic but may also reflect market adjustments to integrating crypto into the national economy. As Bitcoin became more established, inflation rates decreased, suggesting a potential correlation between adoption and price stabilization. Although the country’s trade deficit widened slightly to $785 million in August 2024 from $769 million, the current account shifted to a surplus of $243 million in June 2024 from a deficit of $182 million. Government debt decreased substantially to 59.08% of GDP in Dec. 2023 from 78.03%, enhancing fiscal sustainability. While the data indicates a temporal relationship between Bitcoin adoption and inflation trends, other factors likely played significant roles. Fiscal policies leading to a reduction in government debt from 78.03% to 59.08% of GDP by Dec. 2023 also contributed to controlling inflation. Additionally, changes in global economic conditions and commodity prices would have impacted the inflation rate independently of Bitcoin’s influence. El Salvador continues to purchase 1 BTC per day. In August, Max Keiser, a Senior adviser to El Salvador President Nayib Bukele on Bitcoin, commented, “Bitcoin ‘de-risked’ El Salvador.” The post How El Salvador’s Bitcoin gamble impacted inflation appeared first on CryptoSlate.

In an Oct. 8 post on X, Vera stated that most mining facilities use mid-generation machines, such as Bitmain’s S19J Pro and Canaan’s A1346 models. These machines are more affordable and consume less power, making them ideal for Ethiopia, where electricity costs are low. He added: “Most mining farms had evaporative cooling (water walls) set up, although its not needed for the majority of the year given the cold climate.” Meanwhile, Vera emphasized that Ethiopia is poised to add hundreds of megawatts of capacity by year-end, solidifying its place in the global mining market. Kal Kassa, a local Bitcoin miner, confirmed these trends, sharing images of newly established mining facilities. Similarly, Seb Gouspillou, CEO of BigBlock Datacenter, echoed this sentiment, highlighting the potential for hydropower in Africa. He stated: “For the Hydro electricity sector, it’s like a miracle. The fact that all the African dams currently under construction can be guaranteed to sell as much electricity as they can produce was unimaginable until now. Bitcoin fixes this.” These developments align with an earlier report from asset management firm VanEck, which identified Ethiopia among seven nations mining Bitcoin with direct government support. Earlier this year, the government’s investment branch, Ethiopian Investment Holdings, announced a preliminary agreement with Hong Kong-based West Data Group for a $250 million project to enhance the nation’s digital infrastructure to support BTC mining activity. However, challenges remain. Despite an installed capacity of 5,200 MW, over 40% of Ethiopia’s 130 million citizens still lack access to electricity. The country aims to generate 25 GW of renewable energy by 2030, but access to power remains a significant hurdle for Bitcoin mining expansion.

According to CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator, Bitcoin has transitioned into a bear phase after an overheated bull period earlier this year. Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator | Source: CryptoQuant In March 2024, Bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $73,750.07, reflecting a significant peak in market optimism. This surge corresponded with an overheated bull phase, where prices significantly exceeded historical averages. Historically, Bitcoin’s bull markets reach their peaks around 500 days after a halving event, suggesting that the current cycle may not have fully matured. Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator 2024 | Source: CryptoQuant However, the realized price chart, which calculates the average price of all Bitcoins based on their last movement, indicates that Bitcoin is still around the midpoint of its cycle. In previous cycles, the realized price has risen to new highs before the market transitions into a prolonged bear phase. The current data implies that Bitcoin has yet to hit the peak typically observed in past bull markets. Bitcoin Realized Price Bands | Source: CryptoQuant Despite entering a bear phase, Bitcoin’s price remains strong compared to the beginning of the year. On Oct. 9, Bitcoin was trading at $62,151, almost doubling its value since January, when it was around $42,000. This sustained performance suggests robust market support, even amid fluctuations and cooling market sentiment. Bitcoin market cycles are characterized by periods of rapid growth followed by corrections. The recent shift into a bear phase could signal a temporary consolidation rather than the end of the bull market. Previous cycles have exhibited similar patterns, with interim bear phases occurring before the market resumes its upward trajectory toward new peaks. Analysts are debating whether the early 2024 peak represents the cycle’s climax or if Bitcoin will continue to rise into 2025, fitting the historical pattern of bull market tops appearing over a year after the last halving. The realized price chart supports the possibility of further growth, as the peak typically occurs after surpassing the midpoint, with the upper band currently at $127,000. Bitcoin Realized Price Bands 2024 | Source: CryptoQuant Factors such as regulatory developments, the 2024 US Election, institutional adoption, and other macroeconomic conditions could influence Bitcoin’s trajectory in the coming months. The interplay between the bear/bull market indicator and the realized price suggests that while market sentiment has cooled, underlying fundamentals may still support continued growth. Further, with Bitcoin holding strong above $60,000, it is hard to be bearish on the asset. The key question remains whether Bitcoin will adhere to its historical cycles, with a significant peak yet to come, or if the early 2024 surge was the pinnacle for this period, bolstering fears of significantly diminishing returns.

Crypto News,Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan Highlights Factors Behind a Potential $80K Bitcoin Rally in Q4,"Wed, 09 Oct 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/matt-hougan-breaks-down-bitcoins-80k-rally-potential-in-q4/,"Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan expects Bitcoin to reach $80K by the end of 2024, influenced by factors such as the U.S. election, Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, and the stability of the crypto market. He also highlights altcoin growth as a possible catalyst for Bitcoin's surge.The postBitwise CIO Matt Hougan Highlights Factors Behind a Potential $80K Bitcoin Rally in Q4appeared first onCryptonews."," In a memo to clients dated October 8, 2024, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan predicted that Bitcoin could surge to $80,000 by the end of the fourth quarter, influenced by factors such as the U.S. presidential election, economic conditions, and the stability of the crypto market. Hougan explained that this Bitcoin rally would depend on several key factors, including the outcome of the upcoming U.S. election, broader economic developments, and the stability of the cryptocurrency industry.  He also suggested that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 shortly afterward, provided market sentiment continues to improve. Matt Hougan Asserts a Donald Trump Win Could Boost Bitcoin Rally Hougan emphasized that a victory for Republican candidate Donald Trump in the 2024 U.S. election could significantly bolster Bitcoin’s price.  He noted that many Americans view the election, set for November 5, as a binary outcome for the crypto market: a Trump win could fuel Bitcoin’s rise, while a Democratic victory, especially under Vice President Kamala Harris, might create obstacles for digital assets. Hougan pointed to influential figures like U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been a vocal critic of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as potential roadblocks if the Democrats win.  In contrast, other prominent figures, such as Representative Ritchie Torres, have been supportive of the crypto industry.  He also highlighted recent comments by Representative Maxine Waters, who previously criticized digital assets but recently acknowledged that “crypto is inevitable,” signaling a possible shift in the Democratic stance.  This is by far the most positive thing we've ever heard from Rep. Waters on crypto, who's likely to be Chair of Financial Services again if Dems retake the House.Dems can't stay anti-crypto with leadership talking like this. Never underestimate how fast things can change in DC. https://t.co/90UwHrOyq7— Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) September 26, 2024  Economic Drivers and Crypto Market Stability Turning to economic factors, Hougan emphasized their critical role in driving Bitcoin’s rally. According to the memo, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have benefited from recent global economic developments, including the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates and China’s introduction of a $284 billion fiscal stimulus.  中国政府、追加財政出動で2,840億ドル相当の国債発行へー住宅市場中心に経済立て直し図る*CHINA TO ISSUE $284B SOVEREIGN DEBT IN FRESH FISCAL STIMULUS – SOURCES— Yuto Haga  (@Yuto_Headline) September 26, 2024  Hougan expects another 50 basis points in rate cuts from the Fed by the end of the year, alongside additional economic stimulus from China.  If these conditions hold, he believes the environment will be ideal for a Bitcoin rally. However, he cautioned that if these expectations fall short, market enthusiasm could diminish. For Bitcoin to reach the $80,000 mark, Hougan stressed that the crypto market must avoid major disruptions, such as large-scale hacks, new lawsuits, or a sudden influx of previously locked coins entering circulation.  Stability within the market will be important for Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. Matt Hougan Identifies Altcoin Growth as Key Catalyst for Bitcoin Rally Hougan also pointed to the growth of altcoins as a potential catalyst for Bitcoin’s surge.  While Bitcoin’s long-term success does not rely on the performance of other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Solana, Hougan explained that a robust altcoin market could foster broader enthusiasm for Bitcoin. He argued that strong momentum in the altcoin space often attracts new investors and generates excitement, which can have a ripple effect on Bitcoin.  This dynamic is especially important during periods of market volatility, where a strong altcoin rally can help support Bitcoin’s climb toward higher price levels. Hougan remains confident in his $80,000 Bitcoin prediction, maintaining that a combination of political, economic, and market stability will set the stage for a significant rally by the end of 2024.

However, authorities are unable to access the funds due to lost digital keys, leaving the Bitcoin locked away. Despite efforts to recover the access codes, the cryptocurrency remains inaccessible.The postIrish Authorities Unable to Access $380 Million in Seized Bitcoinappeared first onCryptonews."," The Irish Criminal Assets Bureau has been unable to access $380 million in Bitcoin seized from convicted drug dealer Clifton Collins in 2019, as the digital keys required to unlock the funds were lost, according to a Wednesday report from The Irish Times.  Criminal Assets Bureau seized virtual currency from former Dublin beekeeper who grew cannabis crops for years, without drawing Garda attention, until caught by chance https://t.co/66p9mRVCyU— The Irish Times (@IrishTimes) October 9, 2024  The Irish Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) confiscated the Bitcoin from Collins, who had amassed the cryptocurrency through proceeds from his cannabis-growing operation.  Despite the original value of $58 million, the asset’s value has surged substantially due to Bitcoin’s rising market price, but authorities remain locked out of the funds. Irish Criminal Assets Bureau Bitcoin Seizure: 12 Wallets Confiscated in 2019 In 2019, during an investigation into Collins’ illicit activities, authorities discovered that he had invested his drug earnings in cryptocurrency starting in 2011.  Collins had distributed his Bitcoin across 12 wallets, recording the access codes on a piece of paper that he kept in a fishing rod case at one of his properties. However, following a break-in at the property, the fishing rod case and the crucial access codes were lost.  Despite ongoing efforts by Irish authorities, the digital keys required to access the Bitcoin have not been recovered, leaving the funds locked away and inaccessible. While the value of the seized crypto has soared in line with Bitcoin’s market price, the CAB remains unable to access the wallets.  Officials have expressed hope that technological advancements or other means may eventually unlock the digital assets, but so far, no solution has been found. Ireland Strengthens MiCA Compliance Amid Growing Focus on Bitcoin While the search for a solution to access the Bitcoin continues, Ireland is also working to ensure consistent enforcement of cryptocurrency regulations across the European Union.

Investors had widely expected China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to outline additional stimulus measures following a Tuesday briefing after the Chinese Golden Week holiday. Anticipation was high for a continuation of the government’s September plans, which included rate cuts and liquidity support to invigorate the slowing economy. Instead, the briefing lacked urgency and specifics, with no new plans for further stimulus, underwhelming investors, and dented market sentiment.  HSI falls by 9.4% → its worst day since 2008  This comes as China’s stimulus conference fails to impress.And today was then first trading day since mainland investors returned from a weeklong holiday.Is the honeymoon over?Elevator up, elevator down. pic.twitter.com/FmuxiDeHSx— Oktay Kavrak, CFA (@OKavrak) October 8, 2024  According to a 10x Research report, the anticipated stimulus measures were expected to “ignite a parabolic rally in cryptocurrency prices, fueled by increasing global liquidity.” The absence of such measures has derailed expectations of a substantial rally as Chinese markets re-opened on Tuesday, and a spill-over into crypto markets. Consequently, the Hang Seng index posted its largest drop since 2008 and its second-largest drop since 2000 today, falling 9.41%. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin price dropped 2.86%. U.S. Economy Bolsters ‘Uptober’ Sentiment Although this news dampens ‘Uptober’ sentiment, October is still expected to perform well, as analysts point to concerns surrounding the U.S. economy as the primary narrative driving price action through the month. Following stronger-than-expected jobs data, fears that last month’s dovish rate cut would be too little too late in the bid to tackle a looming U.S. recession are dissipating. The narrative suggests that a soft landing for the U.S. economy still seems achievable. Most notably, the upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) release on October 10th is anticipated to bring the next significant installment in the narrative.  The CPI forecast of 2.3%, down from the previous 2.5%, suggests a modest slowdown in inflation. This is corroborated by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, another key inflation measure, which already fell to 2.2% last month, indicating a trend of decreasing inflation. FTX Case Developments Reinforce Bullish Q4 for Bitcoin While Bitcoin continues to range between $60K and $65K so far this October, positive developments in the FTX estate creditor repayment process keep the outlook for a bullish Q4 intact. Nearly two years after the crypto exchange’s collapse, a US Judge approved FTX’s reorganization plan during a hearing on Monday, bringing creditor repayments one step closer. The plan will see 98% of FTX creditors receive at least 118% of the value of their claim in cash. Some crypto market observers speculated that this could result in a flood of new money entering the crypto markets if FTX creditors choose to immediately reinvest what they receive.

The report estimated that payouts would begin late this quarter and continue into early Q1 2025, within a 60-day window of the court’s effective date, which is still uncertain but expected to be in mid-November. This adds to the suite of stacking catalysts building the case for a bullish Q4, not only anticipated to propel Bitcoin but also potentially sparking an altcoin season cited to be the “biggest” since 2017.

In a recent report, analysts from K33 said that the leading cryptocurrency has shown resilience, with positive signals emerging from the FTX estate’s creditor repayment process, which could bolster market sentiment. Bitcoin Rebounds After Strong U.S. Data Last week’s geopolitical unrest and its impact on global markets initially put pressure on Bitcoin, causing a downturn. However, better-than-expected U.S. employment figures contributed to a market rebound over the weekend, allowing Bitcoin to regain some lost ground. The rebound aligns with analysts’ views that Bitcoin remains well-positioned for a strong performance as the year draws to a close. A key development influencing market sentiment is the progress in the FTX bankruptcy proceedings. Nearly two years after the crypto exchange’s collapse, Judge John Dorsey of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware approved a reorganization plan for FTX during a hearing on Monday. This plan, which aims to begin creditor repayments, received broad support, with about 94% of creditors in the “dotcom customer entitlement claims” class backing the proposal. These creditors represent around $6.83 billion in claims by value.  Negative funding rates are fueling my bullish stance.Just a heads-up: we're in #Bitcoin Quarter 4. pic.twitter.com/nXddQy27qk— Kyledoops (@kyledoops) October 7, 2024  According to K33 analysts Vetle Lunde and David Zimmerman, creditor repayments are expected to begin late in Q4 and extend into early 2025. They project that the process could commence within a 60-day window following the court’s effective date, anticipated for mid-November. The analysts specified that debtors with claims under $50,000 would receive their payouts within this period, accounting for roughly $1.2 billion worth of assets. Larger creditors, part of the entitlement class, could see $9 billion in payouts by February 2025. Sell-Side Pressure Has Been Alleviated A critical question for market observers is how much of the returned capital will flow back into the cryptocurrency and Bitcoin market in Q4. Lunde and Zimmerman noted that much of the sell-side pressure has already been alleviated, given that many of the crypto assets from the estate have been converted into fiat currency. Of the total claims, estimated between $14.4 billion and $16.3 billion, about $3.9 billion has likely been acquired by credit funds, which are expected to hold rather than reinvest in the market. Furthermore, around one-third of the remaining claims belong to entities from sanctioned countries, insiders, or individuals without KYC verification, making it difficult for them to claim their funds. After accounting for these factors, the analysts estimate that approximately $8 billion remains, with 20% to 40%—around $2.4 billion—potentially flowing back into the crypto markets. However, they believe this influx will be gradual, reducing its immediate impact on market dynamics. K33’s analysis also reveals that only 21 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have outperformed Bitcoin in 2024, with most being memecoins, less liquid tokens, or new Layer 1 projects. Nearly half of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have seen negative returns, while 25—including ETH, SOL, AAVE, DOGE, and TRX—have posted gains but still underperformed Bitcoin. Sell-Offs Related to Geopolitical Risks Present Buying Opportunity In an analysis shared with Cryptonews.com, ETC Group said that past trends suggest that such sell-offs related to geopolitical risks often present tactical buying opportunities. It added that the geopolitical tensions have now eased, and other factors, like the increased odds of Donald Trump’s election, have influenced the market recovery. “On the macro side, the most recent positive US jobs report has blown out expectations and have eased market concerns for an imminent US recession,” the report said. This has led to higher Treasury yields and increased expectations of fewer rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Nevertheless, ETC said that despite the recent turbulence, sentiment remains neutral, and market participants are closely watching shifts in liquidity and macroeconomic developments. “Our in-house “Cryptoasset Sentiment Index” has reversed from high levels and currently signals neutral sentiment again,” it wrote. Conclusion Despite recent market challenges, Bitcoin’s outlook for a strong finish in the fourth quarter remains promising. The easing of geopolitical tensions and positive developments, such as the progress in the FTX bankruptcy proceedings and better-than-expected U.S. employment data, have supported a market rebound. Analysts believe that the anticipated creditor repayments could further boost sentiment, with a portion of the returned capital likely flowing back into the crypto markets. However, ETC noted that despite the recent turbulence, sentiment remains neutral, and market participants are closely watching shifts in liquidity and macroeconomic developments.

There are huge stakes on the line here this election regarding Bitcoin. Trump is promising very favorable regulations, in comparison to Harris, who has put forth no regulations and has an almost four year track record of attacking the industry. But I think Di makes a great point here. When it comes to Bitcoin, this election means something much more just favorable regulation. This is the best chance we have to free Ross Ulbricht, an early Bitcoin pioneer and founder of the Silk Road bitcoin marketplace. Taking into account all public information regarding Harris, there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that she would support the Bitcoin industry, let alone free Ross.Bitcoiners have been desperate to get Ross out of jail for as long as I can remember. Every conference I’ve attended for the last four years, this has always been a focal point. I’ll never forget sitting outside of the hotel of the BitBlockBoom conference in 2021 talking with Francis Pouliot, hearing him passionately speak about how badly he wanted to liberate Ross from prison. For many, getting Ross free could mean everything.“I got out of the cell yesterday long enough to take a shower, call home and say ""hi"" to a few friends in here,” said Ross through his X account run by his fiancée today. “It felt really good to be out from between those 8x10ft walls and locked door and make contact with the free world.”Ross has wrongly and harshly served over 12 years in prison. He is now forty years old, and will have plenty of time to live a great life with his fiancée, family, and friends, and pursue whatever ventures he may be interested in. It’s time to get him home. But to make this a reality, we still have to fight to win this election like we’re 13% down.   This article is a Take.

Yes, there will be a messy period of complete crypto degeneracy before that.","Murad Mahmudov is back igniting our X timelines, but you may have noticed these days the “former” Bitcoin maximalist isn’t posting much about Bitcoin.   For the uninitiated, Murad is a Bitcoin maximalist, albeit one who has run the ire of the culture for taboo ideas: see his 2021-2022 embrace of wrapped Bitcoin assets on other blockchains, and most recently, his incessant writing about a “memecoin supercycle.” It’s a far cry from his posts circa 2018, when could be seen on “The Pomp Podcast,” saying things like “Bitcoin is the soundest hardest currency that has ever been invented in history.”So, how did he get from that admission to advocating for a portfolio of PEPE and GIGA, his most recent mantra that you should “invest in cults?”From here on out, the Crypto Markets will be increasingly dominated by Memecoin Bubbles until the eventual Bitcoin Standard.It really is that simple.— Murad 💹🧲 (@MustStopMurad) July 9, 2024  Well, it starts with the post above, one of a few that’s got me thinking Murad is on to something.To be clear, what we’re talking about here is a complete disregard for the idea that a belief in Bitcoin as a currency requires one to have some kind of moral duty. While this has been made fashionable of late, advocated by the likes of Michael Saylor and Jimmy Song, I’ve never seen a compelling argument that Bitcoin maximalism requires you to forsake financial speculation.It’s quite simply a moral choice, extrinsic to the technology, and one everyone is free to make for themselves. Yes, it’s bad to scam people. No, no one can stop you but you. To this effect, Murad appears to be signaling that in this next cycle he intends to profit from the general collapse in confidence ongoing in altcoin land, and is merely going against the grain. Putting aside the moral issue, there’s a lot to like about Murad’s thesis. I’d go so far as to argue, most Bitcoin maximalists would agree with most of it. Essentially, he’s betting on two concurrent trends that really cut to the heart of the movement: Bitcoin is really on its way to becoming the world’s dominant asset. It’s completely mispriced in the present, and will one day be the only remaining crypto asset and the money of the world.The crypto VC apparatus is collapsing slowly. Despite their years of claimed tech advances, there is little to show for the engineering. All altcoins will fail to compete with Bitcoin, and we’re beginning to see this because retail investors are only buying random memecoins.All this is to say, is it really so hard to believe that in between these two truths will lie a messy period of complete crypto degeneracy?IMO, you don’t need to speculate on this to think it’s hilarious. Expect Murad to become more relevant as this thesis plays out."
Crypto Potato,3 Reasons Why Bitcoin (BTC) Could Bounce This Month: Details,"Thu, 10 Oct 2024",https://cryptopotato.com/3-reasons-why-bitcoin-btc-could-bounce-this-month-details/,Here's why BTC can still rally in the following weeks.,"TL;DR  Despite recent volatility, several indicators suggest that BTC might be entering a bullish phase. On the other hand, one essential element hints at an intensified pullback in the short term.   ‘Uptober’ Still in the Cards? Bitcoin (BTC) has passed through severe volatility since the start of October, performing worse than some expected. After all, the ongoing month has been a historically positive period for the entire cryptocurrency industry, thus known across the community as “Uptober.” Currently, BTC trades at just south of $61,000, a 5% decline on a 10-day scale. However, some essential metrics suggest that a resurgence could be on the horizon. BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko According to CryptoQuant, BTC exchange outflows have predominantly surpassed inflows in the last week. As observed in the chart below, the past few days witnessed the emergence of huge red candles, which signal a potential shift from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods. This could be viewed as a bullish sign since it reduces the immediate selling pressure.  BTC Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant Next on the list is the BTC MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value), which recently dropped under 2. Readings below that mark typically indicate that the market is in an accumulation phase, signaling potential buying opportunities. Last but not least, we will touch upon Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI). The momentum oscillator, which measures the speed and change of price movements, neared the bullish zone of 30 on October 9 and is currently positioned at around 38. As of the moment, it flashes the “close to buy” signal. Something for the Bears, too Contrary to the aforementioned factors suggesting a possible price revival, there is one hinting at the opposite scenario. According to X user Ali Martinez, this is the increased activity from whales who have sold or redistributed 30,000 BTC in the past 72 hours (equaling almost $1.9 billion). The development increases the circulating supply of the primary cryptocurrency, which could result in a plunging valuation (assuming demand doesn’t catch up with the pace). Additionally, the actions of such large investors can trigger panic among smaller players, causing them to dump their holdings and accelerate the pullback.

If the price fails to hold the $60K support, the likelihood of a mid-term decline toward the $52K-$55K zone increases. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily chart, Bitcoin’s surge above both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages briefly revived bullish sentiment. However, upon reaching the $66K resistance zone, substantial selling pressure emerged, halting the uptrend. This area has historically served as a robust multi-month resistance, and Bitcoin’s failure to surpass it resulted in a significant rejection. Currently, Bitcoin is trading below the 200-day moving average of $63.4K and resting on the 100-day moving average of around $61K. This zone is critical, as the $60K support region is both psychological and substantial. If Bitcoin breaks below this barrier, a mid-term decline toward the $52K-$55K range becomes likely. This area represents the next major support level and could be the target if bearish momentum continues. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin’s surge was met with heavy resistance in the 0.618-0.786 Fibonacci OTE retracement zone, which corresponds to the $66K price level. This selling pressure led to a sharp rejection, resulting in a 10% decline. The presence of sellers near the $66K level indicates that it remains a formidable barrier, acting as a key resistance level in the broader market outlook. As a result, Bitcoin is expected to enter a short-term consolidation phase, with the $60K psychological support being the next crucial level to watch. If Bitcoin holds above this support, it may consolidate before attempting another upward move. However, if the $60K support is breached, a deeper retracement toward the $55K level becomes highly probable, marking a potential shift to a sustained bearish trend. Source: TradingView On-chain Analysis By Shayan The Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index is a key indicator that helps assess whether U.S. institutional investors or large traders are actively buying or selling BTC on Coinbase compared to other exchanges. Currently, the index shows negative values, indicating a bearish sentiment in the market, with either significant selling pressure or a pause in accumulation by large investors. In the short term, this negative premium reflects a lack of demand from U.S.-based institutional investors, contributing to bearish market sentiment. However, this period of low sentiment for long-term holders can often present attractive buying opportunities. From a broader perspective, while the market is still moving within a descending trend channel, both accumulation and selling pressure seem to be tapering off. This suggests a period of market indecision where neither bulls nor bears have a firm grip on the direction of price action. As a result, this is not an ideal time for short-term trading, as the lack of a clear trend introduces increased risk.

The committee will act as an advisory body designed to provide comprehensive oversight and guidance for the crypto industry. It will be led by the FSC Vice Chairman, Soyoung Kim, and includes representatives from related government departments and nine private sector members. Additionally, the Virtual Asset Committee will address key issues in the South Korean digital asset sector, including the authorization of corporate accounts. Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto ETFs are banned under the current South Korean Capital Markets Act. The prohibition extends to corporate accounts for digital assets due to concerns surrounding anti-money laundering compliance. Non-profit for user protection In addition to the new committee, the FSC has established the Digital Asset User Protection Foundation, a non-profit organization designed to assist users in recovering assets from service providers that have ceased operations. The FSC is also reviewing renewal applications for digital asset service providers, with some registrations set to expire in October 2024. Chairman Kim Byung-hwan, addressing the National Assembly, reiterated the agency’s commitment to developing a robust monitoring system as the law protecting virtual asset users takes effect. Furthermore, the regulator reiterated its focus on investigating vulnerabilities within the trading monitoring system and enforcing strict measures against unfair trading practices. The FSC also plans to gradually implement the second phase of legislation, which includes further regulations on the business activities of crypto service providers, as part of its ongoing effort to enhance the regulatory framework for crypto in the country. Easing the Kimchi premium CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said the spot Bitcoin ETF approval in South Korea will minimize the “Kimchi premium” by opening the market to arbitrage mutual funds and market makers. Kimchi premium is a term to address the phenomenon when crypto prices in South Korea average higher than the rest of the global markets. This is usually caused by a higher demand for crypto within the country compared to the rest of the world. According to Chainalysis, the Kimchi premium fluctuates based on market conditions and regulatory changes, making it a popular indicator among traders. When Bitcoin reached a new all-time high in March, the Kimchi premium also registered a new record. The post South Korea to discuss approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs appeared first on CryptoSlate. "
Crypto News,Bitcoin Price Forecast: US Inflation Data Released — Will BTC Rally Gain Momentum?,"Thu, 10 Oct 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-forecast-us-inflation-data-released-will-btc-rally-gain-momentum/,"Bitcoin dropped below $59,000 after higher-than-expected U.S. inflation data sparked fears of a more hawkish Federal Reserve stance.The postBitcoin Price Forecast: US Inflation Data Released — Will BTC Rally Gain Momentum?appeared first onCryptonews."," During the US session, Bitcoin (BTC) could not stop its losing streak, dropping sharply below $59,000, hitting an intra-day low of $58,930. This decline is largely attributed to the higher-than-expected US CPI numbers for September, which showed inflation rising 2.4%, surpassing the market’s forecast of 2.3%.  However, the stronger-than-anticipated inflation figures have triggered concerns about a potential Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance, possibly delaying interest rate cuts.  This uncertainty has dampened market sentiment, leading to a broader crypto market selloff, pushing Bitcoin prices further down.  Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot volatile as US CPI print comes in hotter than expectedhttps://t.co/0ci7xYIixX – The US Consumer Price Index inflation data released today showed that inflation didn’t slow down as much as expected in September, which apparently disappointed Bitcoin… pic.twitter.com/bfnoxSArM0— Orson Merrick (@Orson_Merrick) October 10, 2024  Another factor weighing on Bitcoin (BTC) is the recent surge of regulatory actions targeting the cryptocurrency sector. The SEC’s lawsuit, along with the Department of Justice’s charges against several market makers for market manipulation, has intensified investor anxiety.  Additionally, SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s remarks, describing the crypto industry as rife with “fraudsters,” have further fueled the negative sentiment surrounding BTC. Impact of Rising Inflation on Bitcoin’s Price and Market Sentiment On the US front, the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data revealed that inflation rose to 2.4% in September, exceeding market expectations of 2.3%. The CPI showed a monthly inflation rate of 0.2%, consistent with the previous months, but the yearly rate is the lowest since February 2021.  Meanwhile, the Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also rose to 3.3% year-over-year.   US CPI data came in hotter than expected at 2.4%, sparking concerns of a potential #Bitcoin dip below $60K.  $BTC is trading in a falling wedge pattern.  @DEXWireNews #Crypto #BTC #Inflation Learn More About $BTC Download our Mobile App » https://t.co/zrHOEYAVmX pic.twitter.com/Sb51iGzhlU— DEXWireNews – Stocks & Crypto  (@DEXWireTeam) October 10, 2024  Following the CPI release, Bitcoin’s price fell by more than 2%, briefly dipping below $59,000 within the past 24 hours. This decline contributed to a broader selloff in the cryptocurrency market.  Amid these developments, the market is now predicting an 84% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve at their upcoming November meeting, a shift from previous expectations of a larger cut.  Additionally, the US 10-year bond yield climbed to 4.073%, while the US Dollar Index dropped by 0.10% to $102.595, reflecting the current financial climate. Therefore, the unexpected rise in inflation could lead to increased market volatility for Bitcoin, potentially pushing its price further down. If the Federal Reserve adopts a more hawkish stance, Bitcoin may struggle to regain momentum, risking further declines below $60,000. Regulatory Pressure Weighs on Bitcoin Price and Market Sentiment Recent U.S. regulatory actions have added downward pressure to Bitcoin’s price. The Department of Justice charged four market makers and over a dozen individuals with market manipulation, while SEC Chair Gary Gensler criticized the crypto industry, calling it rife with fraud.  He noted that many key players are either facing legal trouble or are already imprisoned.

Analysts, like Lekker’s Thompson, suggest that regulatory scrutiny may keep Bitcoin’s price stagnant until after the U.S. elections in November.  The increased legal pressure and harsh remarks from regulators could limit any significant price recovery in the short term. Key Takeaways:  Legal Pressure: Recent charges and regulatory comments have soured market sentiment. Range-Bound Trading: Analysts predict Bitcoin will remain range-bound until regulatory clarity improves. Short-Term Outlook: Bitcoin may face continued selling pressure, limiting its potential for gains in the near future.  Bitcoin Bounces 0.82% but Faces Strong Resistance at $61,000 Bitcoin (BTC/USD) trades at around $60,150, gaining 0.82% on the day after hitting a low of $59,530. The price remains below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $62,080, indicating strong resistance.  The recent bounce suggests potential short-term bullish momentum, but it remains capped by the $60,740 resistance level. A decisive break above this could target the next resistance at $61,240 and $61,985. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview However, immediate support is seen at $59,540, followed by deeper levels at $58,880 and $58,350. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has recovered to 40, indicating neutral momentum but still below the key 50 mark. A break below $59,540 may trigger further selling, potentially pushing prices back to $58,880. For now, Bitcoin’s short-term outlook is cautiously bearish below $61,240, but a move above $61,240 could change sentiment to bullish. Key Insights:  Support Break: Immediate support at $59,540 is critical; a break below could lead to deeper declines. Resistance Levels: A move above $60,740 may open the door to further gains.

In an October 9 X post, Brandt delivered his expectations for Bitcoin through 2025, citing the market’s consolidation since March as a “brief pause,” with the bulk of the bull market still ahead. This forecast draws from past halving cycles. Historical data shows that the latter half of Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycles always produces the sharpest price upside. With this macro stance, Brandt sets a Bitcoin price target of $135,000 by August to September 2025.  However, there is a caveat: if the bears gain control soon and Bitcoin experiences a big downside, $48,000 becomes the prediction’s make-or-break level. “Close below $48K negates my chart analysis,” Brandt confirmed. 10x Research Cautions Bitcoin Maxis  Although macro trends can be insightful, 10x Research CEO Markus Theilin cautioned in an October 9 report that they are an “overly simplistic and insufficient” basis for predicting market direction. He noted common expectations among Bitcoin maximalists that Bitcoin’s price “will increase tenfold indefinitely” post-halving and will rally exponentially with the “bottoming out of the liquidity cycle, marked by Fed rate cuts and rising money supply.” While these factors undeniably provide tailwinds, Theilin emphasizes that strong fundamentals must back these macro factors. This necessity is evident as Bitcoin continues to affirm its downtrend months after its last halving. Meanwhile, the narrative suggesting a soft landing for the US economy seems increasingly plausible following September’s aggressive Fed rate cut. Bitcoin downtrend. Source: 10x Research. The report argues that the current market suffers from a lack of compelling momentum. While “macro factors can set the direction, the ship won’t stay on course without enough wind.”  US Election to Play Pivotal Role Among the potential catalysts that could provide Bitcoin with the “wind” it needs for a breakthrough, Theilin cited the upcoming November 5th U.S. presidential election to play a “critical role.” A Trump victory is generally viewed as favorable for cryptocurrencies, particularly given his involvement in Bitcoin 2024 and his announcements regarding a decentralized finance (DeFi) project called World Liberty Financial. Analysts anticipate that a Trump administration would expedite the development of pro-crypto policies. Past Standard Chartered reports project a less conservative Bitcoin price target of $220K under a Trump presidency. Conversely, the report highlighted the potential for a Harris presidency to push Bitcoin to new heights, setting a target of $75,000, especially following her recent public endorsement of digital assets. However, it cautioned that her election might trigger an initial price decline. Investors are expected to buy the dips as the market recognizes that progress on the regulatory front will continue. In summary, Theilin expressed optimism, stating it is “too early” to abandon hopes for a Q4 rally. However, he emphasized that effective risk management is “crucial.” The post Trader Peter Brant Predicts $135K Bitcoin in 2025, But Short-Term Challenges Loom appeared first on Cryptonews. "

At $139, SOL is now up by a modest 1% in a week and by 3.5% in a week, with the altcoin sitting on an impressive 520% gain in a year. Yet things could get even better for Solana, with Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick suggesting that the altcoin could rocket by 400% in 2025 if Donald Trump wins next month’s election. Kendrick explains that the approval of Solana ETFs would be likelier under a Trump administration, yet with SOL having the strongest momentum of any major alt this year, it’s still likely to perform well even if Kamala Harris wins. Solana Price Analysis: Could a Trump Victory Propel SOL to Outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum? “The metrics suggest the market is pricing in a very bright growth future for Solana, with an expected increase in throughput of 100 to 400 times,” Kendrick said, writing in a note to investors yesterday.

Indeed, there’s every reason to believe that Solana would continue to perform well, such is its recent momentum. And while it’s down today, its chart suggests that it’s very close to rebounding. Its indicators are in decidedly oversold positions, with its relative strength index (purple) beginning to rise towards 50, and potentially higher. Source: TradingView At the same time, SOL’s 30-period moving average (orange) looks like it’s about to hit a bottom in relation to the 200-day average (blue). All the available signs therefore suggest that a recovery is coming soon, especially when Solana’s resistance (red) and support (green) levels are converging on each other. And while some holders may fear a Harris presidency, it’s worth remembering that Solana has risen by more than 500% in the past 12 months, under a Biden administration.    New Presale Tokens Could Big Stories in 2025 While Solana does look like it will have a good 2025 regardless of the result of next month’s election, there are numerous other coins with good potential to outperform the market next year. This includes various presale coins, which in attracting attention and investment prior to listing can often skyrocket once they go on exchanges.

Flockerz will also have a staking mechanism, meaning that holders will earn staking rewards in addition to voting rewards. This could make FLOCK very lucrative as a coin, which helps to explain why demand has already been high. It will have a max supply of 50 billion FLOCK, with 20% going to its presale, 25% to staking, and another 25% for governance rewards.    Anyone interested in FLOCK can join its presale by going to its official website, where they buy the coin at a price of $0.0057469.

According to the CME’s Fed Watch Tool, markets now imply an 87% chance of a 25-basis point rate cut next month, compared to 80% just a day earlier.  However, this failed to spark a rally in Bitcoin, which remains near its 50-day moving average around $60,000. Source: TradingView / BTCUSD Despite the Fed’s first rate cut since 2020—a 50-basis point reduction in September—the Bitcoin price has struggled to find upward momentum.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell has downplayed the chances of additional large rate cuts, and strong economic data, including last week’s jobs report and the CPI release, has pushed back against the likelihood of further cuts.  Additionally, rising military tensions between Iran and Israel have weighed on market sentiment, including Bitcoin. October, often referred to as “Uptober” due to its historically strong performance for Bitcoin, has so far failed to deliver.  Bitcoin is currently down over 4% this month, leading many to wonder if a price surge is still possible. What to Expect from Bitcoin in the Coming Months Several positive factors are emerging that could drive Bitcoin’s price higher later this quarter.  Although the pace and timing of the Federal Reserve’s rate-cutting cycle remain uncertain, financial conditions are expected to ease as long as inflation stays in check.  A robust US economy could provide the necessary support for risk assets like Bitcoin to rally. Additionally, with the 2024 US Presidential election approaching, speculation surrounding a possible Donald Trump victory has grown.  According to Polymarket, Trump’s chances of winning are increasing, with many seeing him as more favorable toward cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin Magazine,What Do Bitcoin Miners Expect Next?,"Fri, 11 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/what-do-bitcoin-miners-expect-next-,What are miners actually planning for going into the near term future? ,"Bitcoin miners have always been a reliable indicator of the overall sentiment within the market. By tracking their earnings and actions, we can get a sense of where the price of BTC might head next. In this article, we'll explore the latest trends in Bitcoin mining, how miners are reacting to current market conditions, and what we can learn from key indicators to gauge how Bitcoin miners are positioning themselves for the coming weeks and months.State of Miner EarningsOne of the best ways to assess Bitcoin miner sentiment is to examine their earnings in relation to historical data. This can be done using The Puell Multiple, which measures current miner earnings against the yearly average from the previous year.As of the latest data, the Puell Multiple is hovering around 0.8, meaning miners are earning 80% of what they were making on average over the past year. This is a marked improvement from a few weeks ago when the multiple was as low as 0.53, indicating miners were earning just over half of their previous year's average.  Figure 1: Miner earnings are down compared to the historical average. View Live Chart 🔍  This significant drop earlier in the year likely put financial pressure on many miners. However, despite these challenges, the fact that the Puell Multiple is recovering suggests that the outlook for miners might be improving.Hashrate and Network GrowthEven though earnings are down, there are no signs of miners leaving the network. In fact, Bitcoin's hashrate, which is the total computational power used to secure the network, has been steadily increasing. This surge in hashrate indicates that more miners are entering the network or existing miners are upgrading their equipment to compete for block rewards.  Figure 2: Hashrate continues to climb to new all-time highs. View Live Chart 🔍  However, looking at the Hash Ribbons Indicator, which tracks the 30-day (blue line) and 60-day (purple line) moving averages of Bitcoin's hashrate, these two averages have been getting closer to crossing, which could potentially indicate a bearish outlook for the short term. When the 60-day average rises above the 30-day average, it historically points to miner capitulation, a time when miners, under financial stress, shut off their equipment.  Figure 3: Hash Ribbons could be on the verge of a bearish crossover. View Live Chart 🔍  Until we see a bearish crossover, there’s no immediate sign of bearishness. One positive is that every time this happens, it has been followed by a period of accumulation, which typically precedes a rise in Bitcoin prices. Investors often consider these capitulation periods great opportunities to buy BTC at lower prices.How Much Are Miners Making?While we’ve discussed miner earnings in relation to Bitcoin’s price, another important factor is the Hashprice, the amount of BTC or USD miners can earn for each terahash (TH/s) of computational power they contribute to the network.  Figure 4: Hashprice indicates increased competition for block rewards in spite of decreased earnings post-halving. View Live Chart 🔍  Currently, miners earn approximately 0.73 BTC per terahash, or about $45,000 in USD terms. This amount has been steadily decreasing in the months following the latest Bitcoin halving event, where miners' block rewards were cut in half, reducing their profitability. Despite these challenges, miners are still increasing their hashrate, which suggests they’re betting on future BTC price appreciation to compensate for their lower earnings.One of the most interesting metrics to watch is the Hashprice Volatility, which tracks how stable or volatile miner earnings are over time. Historically, periods of low hashprice volatility have preceded significant price movements for Bitcoin. As of the latest data, hashprice volatility has begun to drop again, suggesting we could be nearing a period of substantial price movement for Bitcoin.  Figure 5: Hashprice volatility is at very low levels, outlining the potential for a sustained volatile trend in the near future. View Live Chart 🔍  ConclusionBitcoin miner earnings are down compared to a historical average post-halving, but they’re recovering from a recent significant low. Bitcoin's hashrate is still climbing; meaning miners are pouring more computational power into the network despite lower profitability. The hashprice continues to drop, but miners remain optimistic, likely due to expected future price appreciation. Hashprice volatility is falling, historically indicating that a large move in BTC's price could be imminent.Bitcoin miners seem to be bullish about the long-term potential of BTC, despite current challenges. If current metric trends hold, we could be on the verge of a significant price movement, with most indications pointing towards a positive outlook.For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out a recent YouTube video here:What Do Bitcoin Miners Expect Next?"

According to a dashboard shared by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, the longest time BTC took to rise was 298 days. Bitcoin achieved its highest return index during a halving year in 2020, when it hit 4.05 points, while 2016 marked the worst halving year in terms of returns, with the index only reaching 2.26 points. Despite being the second-best performing year, 2012 registered the strongest start after 298 days, achieving 2.06 points in the return index. Longest re-accumulation range of all-time This year also witnessed a major milestone as Bitcoin reached a new all-time high before the halving for the first time in its 15-year history. Based on historical data, Bitcoin hit new all-time highs roughly 240 days after a halving event over the past four cycles. However, this trend was broken this year when the BTC price peaked at $73,737.94 on March 14, essentially accelerating the post-halving bull run by 260 days. However, the multiple corrections registered since the halving have lowered the acceleration rate to 60 days, according to an analyst and trader known as RektCapital. The analyst further suggested that Bitcoin is showing behavior that indicates the market is trying to reduce this acceleration period. Additionally, the historical “re-accumulation period” seen after each Bitcoin halving — when the price trades sideways before a parabolic upward movement — is already the longest since 2016. While it took 161 days after the halving for Bitcoin to begin its all-time high climb in 2016, it took 164 days in 2020. As of Oct. 11, Bitcoin has been trading sideways for 176 days. Since Bitcoin is already overdue to break out of the re-accumulation range between the $71,000 and $60,000 price zones, Rekt Capital predicted that the sideways period could continue for another two months. This would allow enough time to reduce the acceleration rate to zero. That would take the re-accumulation range to 236 days, making it the longest of all time during a halving year.

Historical data indicates that similar swift recoveries on a 30-minute resolution have consistently led to either higher gains or sideways trading, with few instances of further declines. Bitcoin V-shaped recovery Oct. 11 (TradingView) Last week, Bitcoin dropped from $62,000 to around $61,000 before quickly rebounding and trading above $61,000 for several days, eventually reaching $62,800. Bitcoin V-shaped recovery Oct. 4 (TradingView) In late September, after a similar drop to $63,800, Bitcoin formed a V-shaped recovery, surging to $65,400. Bitcoin V-shaped recovery Sept. 25 (TradingView) Earlier that month, on Sept. 11, Bitcoin fell from $56,600 to $55,700, only to recover within two hours and regain its position near $60,000 over the following two days. Bitcoin V-shaped recovery Sept. 11 (TradingView) This pattern can also be traced back to August, when Bitcoin experienced a significant drop from $52,800 to $49,700 on Aug. 5. A V-shaped recovery that afternoon pushed it back to $54,000, with momentum continuing over the next two days, driving the price up to $58,000. Bitcoin V-shaped recovery Aug. 5 (TradingView) Today’s dip below $59,000, followed by a potential retest of the $61,700 resistance level, suggests Bitcoin is once again following this familiar pattern of rapid recovery and upward movement, reinforcing the significance of these sharp rebounds in signaling future price action. While past performance is not indicative of future outcomes, the recurring nature of these recoveries signals potential stability or bullish momentum following such sharp dips. Monitoring Bitcoin’s behavior within this timeframe may provide insights into potential market movements in the coming days. This pattern has been observed since at least June of this year, suggesting that the 30-minute resolution is a key indicator for assessing Bitcoin’s short-term market moves, especially after the launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs. This data reinforces the idea that investors should remain attentive to short-term patterns, particularly on lower timeframes, to gauge Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory.

Per News1, the tentatively named Virtual Assets Committee could hold its first meeting “as early as this month.” The new body will operate under the umbrella of the country’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC). Bitcoin ETF: On the Agenda? The media outlet said that the body’s launch would help “discussions on issues such as approving Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs “gain speed.” Industry insiders were also quoted as stating the committee is also expected to discuss “allowing corporate virtual asset investment.” Several South Korean companies are hopeful of following American and Japanese companies into the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoin investment sectors.

The same expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said some companies “may also look to invest in ETH” if they are given permission. Despite industry pressure and pressure from lawmakers, however, the FSC has repeatedly delayed discussions over Bitcoin ETF approval. The media outlets quoted anonymous crypto industry insiders as stating that the body is also set to talk about “second-stage” crypto legislation. “Kickoff Meeting” Slated for This Month The same insiders said that the financial authorities “plan to finalize” the committee’s membership before the end of October. They also want to “hold a kickoff meeting” before the end of this month. The committee’s legal framework was established under the terms of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act, which came into force in July. The FSC has already appointed its own Vice Chair, Kim So-young, as the new commission’s head. FSC Vice Chair Kim So-young speaking in 2023.

However, lawmaker Lee Kang-il, of the main opposition Democratic Party said:  “In the past, the domestic [crypto] market had an advantage in competitiveness [over its international counterparts].

Crypto News,Bitcoin Price Analysis: Mt.

Gox repayment delay fuels Bitcoin’s rally, pushing it past $62,800. Will the reduced selling pressure sustain BTC's bullish momentum?The postBitcoin Price Analysis: Mt. Gox’s Latest Repayment Delay Pushes BTC Higher – Is This a Buying Signal?appeared first onCryptonews."," Bitcoin’s price has been on an upward trajectory following the announcement that the bankrupt crypto exchange Mt. Gox will delay repayments to its creditors by another year. This has led to speculation about reduced selling pressure in the market and a potential buying opportunity for investors. The Mt. Gox Delay and Its Impact on Bitcoin Mt. Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, collapsed in 2014 after losing 850,000 Bitcoins due to a series of security breaches.  In 2021, a rehabilitation plan was approved to pay back creditors a portion of their funds. Recently, however, the deadline for full repayments has been extended to October 31, 2025.   UPDATE: Mt. Gox Pushes Repayment Plan Deadline to October 2025The trustee overseeing Mt. Gox assets has extended the deadline for creditors’ restitution to October 2025 as over 44,900 BTC remains unpaid. pic.twitter.com/lXBFQkhUUr— Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) October 12, 2024  The delay means that creditors, who had been expecting payouts soon, will have to wait another year before receiving their Bitcoin.  As a result, the market has reacted positively, as billions of dollars worth of BTC will not be cashed out immediately, reducing the risk of a price dump.  On the day of the announcement, Bitcoin rose 5.48%, hitting $62,960, a substantial recovery from the previous day’s low of $59,000. Could This Delay Signal a Buying Opportunity? Historically, the Mt. Gox case has been a point of concern for Bitcoin investors due to the fear of selling pressure from creditors cashing out their recovered Bitcoin. However, the new delay has shifted market sentiment. Traders now speculate that this extension will lead to sustained lower selling pressure over the next year, potentially driving the price higher. Key indicators suggest that the delay could be a buying signal for investors:  Reduced Selling Pressure: With billions of BTC locked until late 2025, selling pressure is expected to remain subdued in the near term. Strong Market Response: Bitcoin’s price rebounded sharply following the delay, reflecting market confidence in the cryptocurrency’s stability. Institutional Investment Interest: Institutions have been steadily increasing their exposure to Bitcoin, which could further strengthen bullish sentiment.  What’s Next for Bitcoin? While the delay in Mt. Gox repayments offers some relief, uncertainty remains in the long term. The market is still recovering from a turbulent period, and other macroeconomic factors, such as interest rate hikes and regulatory challenges, could impact Bitcoin’s performance. However, with Bitcoin climbing back above $62,000 and showing resilience, the delay may provide a rare window for investors to enter the market at favorable prices.  Traders should monitor the market closely for further developments, including any updates on the repayment process. In summary, Bitcoin’s recent price surge is directly tied to the Mt. Gox repayment delay, which has lessened immediate selling concerns.  As long as the delay holds, it could present an opportunity for investors seeking to capitalize on Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. Bitcoin Price Analysis – October 13, 2024 Bitcoin is trading at $62,823, finding resistance near the descending trendline at $63,444. The cryptocurrency has struggled to break above this level, and the downward trendline remains a formidable obstacle.  Should Bitcoin manage a breakout above this resistance, it could push towards the next target of $64,385, followed by a stronger resistance at $65,287.  However, the failure to break the trendline may lead to further downside, potentially retesting the immediate support level of $62,251, which is closely aligned with the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA).  From a technical perspective, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently sitting at 56, signalling a slight bullish bias. However, the momentum is not strong enough to confirm a breakout, and the market remains at a critical juncture.  The 50 EMA, at $62,251, is providing solid support, preventing any sharp declines for the time being. A drop below this level could open the door to the next support at $61,266, with further downside possible towards $60,279. In conclusion, Bitcoin is trapped between its downward trendline and the 50 EMA. Traders should watch for a decisive move either above $63,444 for potential bullish momentum or below $62,251 for a bearish continuation.  The RSI remains relatively neutral, indicating that the market could swing in either direction in the short term.

Are we on the brink?The postBitcoin Price Analysis: Current Bull Cycle Mirrors 2013, 2020 Trends – Another Rally Incoming?appeared first onCryptonews."," Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded from its overnight losses, gaining positive traction around $62,750 and reaching an intraday high of $63,280. This recovery is driven by ongoing bullish momentum, which mirrors patterns in the 2013 and 2020 bull markets. Analyst Crypto Dan from CryptoQuant highlighted that in those previous cycles, long-term investors took profits twice, and the current market is showing similar signs, suggesting another potential upswing.  Bitcoin Reclaims $62k: Analysts Explain Why The Bull Cycle Is Far From Over!Source: NewsBTC— Cryptobeing101 (@cryptobeing101) October 12, 2024  In addition, the current global macroeconomic situation, especially with central banks cutting interest rates, is injecting more liquidity into the market, creating a bullish investment environment. China’s fiscal policy is another significant factor influencing Bitcoin’s price.  The upcoming fiscal policy update from China’s finance minister is expected to reveal measures to stimulate the struggling economy. If the government announces substantial financial stimulus, it could increase liquidity in the global markets, benefiting risk assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin Reclaims $63,000: Bullish Sentiment Fuels Optimism Despite Mixed Signals However, the recent spike in the BTC price is generating renewed optimism in the cryptocurrency community. According to CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan, the market remains in a bull cycle, suggesting bullish long-term prospects for Bitcoin holders.  Dan compared the current market trends to previous bull cycles in 2013 and 2020, indicating that if the patterns hold, another significant upswing could be expected.  He also highlighted the impact of global interest rate cuts, suggesting that prices often rise in anticipation of such changes.  Bitcoin's ($BTC) historical analysis indicates bull trends, aligning with patterns observed in 2013 and 2020, where investors twice capitalized on peaks. https://t.co/WXfJEkrRgN— Blockchain Reporter (@blockchainrptr) October 11, 2024  Another analyst, Avocado Onchain, noted a decline in the Coinbase Premium, which usually signals bearish sentiment. However, Bitcoin’s recent price rebound indicates a more favorable outlook.  Historically, Bitcoin tends to recover after the Coinbase Premium drops below -50 during bull markets, and the absence of panic selling suggests that larger investors are accumulating Bitcoin at lower prices, reinforcing the belief that the bull market may still be ongoing. Hence, Bitcoin’s rebound to $63,000 amid bullish sentiment suggests potential for further price increases. Analysts indicate that historical trends, coupled with institutional accumulation, reinforce optimism, while a decline in Coinbase Premium signals cautious sentiment, contributing to a mixed but positive outlook for BTC. Bitcoin Surges Amid Positive Sentiment and Anticipated China Policy Update On the other side, cryptocurrencies experienced a sharp rebound on Saturday, with Bitcoin (BTC) reclaiming the $63,000 mark. Investors quickly brushed off concerns about slightly higher inflation, focusing instead on a fiscal policy update from China scheduled for Saturday.  Bitcoin rose 7% from its Thursday low of below $59,000, marking a strong recovery. However, the positive crypto rally also coincided with gains in the stock market, as both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 reached record highs.

Analysts noted that the upcoming China fiscal policy announcement could significantly impact the crypto market, as traders may turn to cryptocurrencies to express their views on China’s financial stimulus plans. Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance at $63K, Eyes $60K Support Bitcoin is currently trading around $62,720, showing signs of consolidation just below a descending trendline, which is acting as a significant barrier near $63,450. This level represents immediate resistance, and if Bitcoin manages to break above it, the next target would be $64,400, followed by $65,300. However, failure to clear these levels could lead to further downward pressure.  The immediate support sits around $61,840, closely aligned with the 50-day EMA ($62,500), providing a key level to watch. Below this, the next support level stands at $61,600, with deeper support at $60,600.  On the technical side, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 62, suggesting that Bitcoin is nearing overbought conditions, which could limit upside potential in the short term. The 50 EMA is providing solid support, currently standing at $62,500.  If Bitcoin fails to hold above these support zones, the market could further decline toward the $60,600 region. In conclusion, Bitcoin remains at a critical juncture. While a break above $63,450 could open the doors for a more substantial rally, failure to clear this resistance may lead to a retracement.  Investors should keep an eye on the key support at $61,600, as a breach below this level could signal a deeper correction.

Could Michigan consumer sentiment data drive BTC toward $100,000? Key insights ahead.The postBitcoin Price Forecast: Will Michigan Consumer Sentiment Data Fuel a Rally to $100,000 BTC?appeared first onCryptonews."," Bitcoin price action hinges on key resistance levels as traders eye potential catalysts like the latest Michigan Consumer Sentiment report. With sentiment dropping to 68.9 in October, below expectations, inflation fears persist.  As Bitcoin nears $63,450 resistance, market players wonder whether renewed bullish momentum could drive a rally toward $100,000 or if a pullback looms ahead. US Consumer Sentiment Drops to 68.9 in October, Inflation Expectations Rise to 2.9% The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment data for October 2024 shows a decline to 68.9, down from September’s five-month high of 70.1 and below the forecasted 70.8. Current conditions dropped to 62.7 from 63.3, and the expectations gauge fell to 72.9 from 74.4.  On inflation, expectations for the year ahead increased to 2.9% from 2.7%, but the five-year outlook improved slightly, easing to 3.0% from 3.1%.  Survey Director Joanne Hsu noted that despite frustrations over persistent high prices, long-term business conditions reached a six-month peak while personal financial expectations softened. Bitcoin Price Faces Key Resistance at $63,450; Pullback Ahead? Bitcoin is currently trading at $62,960, up a modest 0.04% daily. However, the cryptocurrency faces a significant challenge as it approaches a key resistance level of $63,450. This level aligns with a downward trendline from previous market highs, forming a crucial barrier to further price gains. A Doji candlestick has formed below this resistance, indicating market indecision and potential for a reversal.  The Doji pattern, often signaling hesitation, suggests that if Bitcoin fails to break this trendline, selling pressure could increase, leading to a possible pullback. Overbought Signals Could Spark a Correction The Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently sitting at 71, places Bitcoin in overbought territory. This technical indicator further strengthens the likelihood of a short-term pullback.  Historically, RSI readings above 70 indicate that an asset may be overextended, increasing the probability of a downward correction.  If Bitcoin does not manage to push above the $63,450 resistance, immediate support levels are seen at $61,550, with additional support around $61,100 and $60,600.  These levels could act as buffers, helping to absorb any selling pressure. Potential for Further Gains if Resistance Breaks Despite the risk of a pullback, a successful breakout above $63,450 would signal renewed bullish momentum. If Bitcoin clears this resistance, the next targets are $64,400 and $65,300.  Breaking these levels could set the stage for a stronger rally, especially if market sentiment improves further in response to upcoming economic data. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Key Insights  Resistance at $63,450: Bitcoin is testing critical resistance, with the potential for a reversal if it fails to break through this level. Overbought Signals: The RSI at 71 suggests the market may be overbought, increasing the risk of a short-term correction. Support and Resistance Levels: If Bitcoin fails to break $63,450, it could test support at $61,550, while a successful breakout could push prices toward $64,400 and beyond.  In summary, Bitcoin’s immediate outlook hinges on breaking through the $63,450 resistance. A failure to do so may lead to a correction, but if Bitcoin can surpass this level, the path toward $64,400 and $65,300 could open up. – You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034  Why Pepe Unchained Is a Strong Addition to Your Crypto Portfolio Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) is quickly becoming a standout in the meme coin space, especially following the buzz around Pepe Coin.

Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Model T: Perfection Doesn't Need Improvement,"Fri, 18 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/bitcoin-model-t-perfection-doesnt-need-improvement,The idea that Bitcoin does not need to improve and is the perfect state of decentralized money is as delusional as thinking the Model T was the perfect state of the automobile. ,"      The Ford Model T has been invented, the automobile has arrived and nothing else must be done! A hand crank start motor, rear wheel drive only, wooden wheels, and transmission based braking system with no wheel brakes. Why would anyone need anything else? Who could need seatbelts? Proper wheel based braking systems? An automated ignition engine? Why would people need reinforced steel frames? Buckle zones? Navigation systems? Shatter-safe glass? Airbags? The Model T is perfect, it is the peak of the automobile and contains all features anyone would ever need!This is what Bitcoiners sound like when arguing vehemently and irrationally against any and all changes to Bitcoin. It is no longer a reasoned position of conservatism, it is pure dogmatic cultism. Bitcoin has very serious problems to address, both in terms of active flaws to shortcomings that put at risk its chance of success as a global monetary network. As far as active flaws right now, OP_CODESEPARATOR allows the construction of blocks that could take up to thirty minutes for a node on high end consumer hardware to validate. This is a denial of service attack vector on network users. The timewarp attack, a method to artificially crank the difficulty of the network lower than it should go, can be accomplished by miners manipulating timestamps in their blocks. An especially small transaction can be used to trick SPV wallets into thinking it is an internal node in a merkle tree of the block, allowing a malicious miner to include entirely fake transactions inside a non-existent branch of the block’s merkle tree that doesn’t actually exist. These are active design flaws right now, with an increasing incentive to take advantage of the more valuable Bitcoin grows. Some just allow a single malicious block to drastically degrade network performance, others allow the malicious miner to actively profit. The timewarp attack offers a way to force the entire network along with an indirect blocksize increase by lowering the difficulty and keeping it low in order to produce blocks at a much faster rate. If enough of the economy supported it to convince miners to enforce it, there would be no way to opt out of it except hardforking. That’s not to mention the massive shortcomings in terms of scalability. Bitcoin is simply not capable of supporting even a significant fraction of the world population in a self custodial way. If Bitcoin were to appreciate in value financially, most of the world would be relegated to custodial and trusted ways to interact with Bitcoin. Lightning is very limited in how many channels can be opened or closed to enforce things on-chain in a high fee environment. The higher the fees, the more limited it will become in this regard. Ark in an optimistic case can be another way to deal with this, but in the non-cooperative case it becomes even worse. There is also another issue, the only way to do Ark right now is require every user in an Ark to all be online at the same time to pre-sign the necessary transactions to create an Ark. The more people, the higher the chance someone isn’t online and forces a non-cooperative case. These issues cannot be solved without fundamental improvements to the Bitcoin protocol itself. Full stop. The limitations of the protocol as it is now does not give us the tool kit to properly solve these shortcomings in a way that does not compromise on the goal of providing people with a trustless form of interacting with their money. People arguing that Bitcoin is good enough are brain dead cultists. They are no different than the hypothetical person who would argue the Ford Model T is enough, and there is nothing we can do to improve on it. This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,The Bitcoin Mempool Drama Was All Too Predictable,"Fri, 18 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/the-bitcoin-mempool-drama-was-all-too-predictable,The mempool drama was all too predictable given the brewing culture wars between monetary maximalist purists and Season 2 pragmatists. ,"      So mempool.space recently added features to spot Runes and Ordinals transactions, and Bitcoin monetary maximalists totally lost it. As a Bitcoiner and observer of Bitcoin culture, this whole drama felt completely normal and predictable.Over time, an ideological split has emerged between Bitcoin monetary maximalists who see Bitcoin as only money and those open to building things on Bitcoin such as innovative, crypto-esq tech like Ordinals, Runes and tokens.With this split mindset now entrenched, the mempool.space backlash was inevitable.To clarify some FUD going around: The Mempool Open Source Project does not support “ord” daemon integration - https://t.co/VXxVsvUuQN only displays data contained in Bitcoin’s mempool and blockchain and from the Lightning network.This means that if you lookup a transaction…— mempool (@mempool) October 12, 2024  From the purist viewpoint, anything beyond the Bitcoin protocol is heresy. So, even just the neutral action of mempool.space displaying Runes and Ordinals data for their users to see provoked outrage. Never mind if it made one of the best open-source Bitcoin explorers more useful and data rich — it touched the ""forbidden"" topic, and all rationality went out the window.This reaction perfectly followed the playbook. The monetary maximalists responded to perceived apostasy with fury, as they always do on X. These clowns have managed to bribe one of the longest-standing and highest-quality open-source projects in the space into labeling transactions that ""contain ordinals, inscriptions, and runes"" as such. It is a shame, to say the least.None of these scams are #Bitcoin. They all… https://t.co/ietxCH3T1f— Knut Svanholm ₿ = ∞/21M = 1/🤡🌍 (@knutsvanholm) October 14, 2024  The Season 2 crowd however, put their money where their mouth is and donated to the helpful platform, doubling the number of individual sponsors and approximately tripling the project’s yearly revenue from individual contributors. They financially backed a tool they found useful rather than just complaining. Actions over words.Bitcoin purists should also put money where their mouths are and support the Bitcoin explorers who do not spot Runes and Ordinals transactions. I have yet to see them do this instead of just screaming on X, which says a lot about them.Both sides acted true to form.This type of drama is inevitable when you have two factions with fundamentally different perspectives. While certain views may go too far ethically, this is ultimately human nature. We'll keep seeing this purist versus pragmatic conflict as Bitcoin evolves and divides into diverging philosophies. Rationality gives way to belief and identity. But understanding these dynamics helps contextualise the mempool reaction.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,"To Succeed Bitcoin Needs Something New, Not More of the Same","Thu, 17 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/to-succeed-bitcoin-needs-something-new-not-more-of-the-same,"Replicating the same types of services and applications of the legacy world on Bitcoin necessitates interacting with the legacy world, giving them leverage over Bitcoin. ","      Too much of this space, and things being built around it, is centered around essentially mimicking the legacy financial system. There is not much being built trying to blaze new grounds. Micropayments, while admittedly something I’ve been very critical of due to the user experience of having to think about tiny transactions all day, has seen almost no real experimentation or development in trying to solve that UX problem at scale. I struggle to think of any application that is truly innovative. Yes, things like crowdfunding or micropayments in games remove a central point of control that can be used to censor use cases of these applications, but they are still reinventing the wheel. Numerous projects are focused on collateralizing fiat or stablecoin loans with Bitcoin, dollar payment rails on Bitcoin, etc. These are important applications to build if Bitcoin is to be used in commerce, that is beyond a doubt, but they are not things that are only possible on Bitcoin. In some cases this has implications for the overall network and protocol if followed through to its extreme. In the case of Bitcoin collateralized dollar loans, for example, it is inescapable that these things interface with the legacy system. This gives those systems some degree of control over those applications, and (proportional to how much activity on Bitcoin they make up) Bitcoin itself. Consensus on Bitcoin is not governed by voting, it is governed by participation. That is,. those actors that actually receive bitcoin in economic activity, and those who transact and generate revenue for miners. If you aren’t doing one of these two things, your node has no influence on network consensus, especially during the instance of a chainsplit or contentious fork. That’s just the cold reality. Bitcoiners focusing on building applications that leverage or interface with the legacy system are just giving the system we are trying to escape a bar wedged into Bitcoin the legacy system can use to leverage against it. It is foolish, short sighted, and a major tactical error. The path forward is to focus on sustainable applications that do not require that interface, that can function totally independently of the legacy system, while still generating revenue for miners and application users and operators. This is the only way forward in terms of encouraging Bitcoin adoption without slowly ceding more and more influence over the network and protocol to the exact types of players we set out to escape in the first place. To truly thrive outside of the existing system, we need markets for digital goods, for services, for real products, for new types of applications that legacy players won’t or can’t clone and monopolize for Bitcoin. "
Bitcoin Magazine,Elizabeth Warren Proves Democrats Are Still Against Bitcoin,"Wed, 16 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/elizabeth-warren-proves-democrats-are-still-against-bitcoin,The Bitcoin industry could be in for yet another four years of harassment and attacks if Kamala Harris is elected president.,"     Follow Nikolaus On X Here  If you were tuned into the Massachusetts Senate debate last night, you would have noticed a key exchange between pro-Bitcoin candidate John Deaton and his rival Elizabeth Warren, leader of Washington D.C.’s “anti-crypto army.”When pressed by Deaton, Warren wouldn’t even defend herself. After lying and attacking our industry for years, she said “I’m fine if people want to buy and sell crypto.” Seriously. My big concern with this moment is that it says everything about the Democrats and the lip service they are playing to the Bitcoin industry.It’s undeniable that Bitcoin has turned into a partisan issue in this country for the most part. Most Democrats have followed Warren in taking a strong stance against supporting Bitcoin (even if they won’t admit it). I suspect Presidential candidate Kamala Harris has done the same. Case and point, even Harris this week issued a generic “we will support blockchain and digital assets,” while not specifying exactly what she would do to help it. But oh wait, she actually did put forth a new policy proposal yesterday, and to no one's surprise, it was a race based one that excludes most Americans. It was a flop in the industry.I have to ask at this point, how much more do pro-Democrat Bitcoiners need to see? The Republicans have clearly embraced the industry. They’ve put forth legislation proposals in an attempt to foster more innovation in the space. They defend the industry from attacks coming from the Democrats. They attend Bitcoin conferences and events, listen to industry leaders, and buy and hold bitcoin personally.They have not been shy in their public support for Bitcoin, and have also actively made it an official part of their party platform. That’s how serious they are.The current leading presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has made many pledges to support and grow the industry, proposing specific policy on what he would enact if elected. Earlier this summer, Trump raised $25 million from private individual donors at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville (his second highest fundraiser across his three campaigns). American Bitcoin miners have met with Trump in Mar-A-Lago to discuss what they need him to do as president to support their businesses. Where Republicans have leaned into Bitcoin, we have seen the opposite with Democrats. At almost every single congressional and Senate hearing I watch, Democrats vote against favorable Bitcoin regulation, and make verbal attacks on the industry.At a congressional hearing only four months ago, Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters actually tried to make the case that we should implement a CBDC, and not ban it, because countries like China are embracing it. She called it the next “space race”. It is crystal clear to anyone watching these congressional and senate hearings which side the Democrats have chosen when it comes to Bitcoin vs CBDC.This is my big fear.If elected president, I believe Harris would have little reason to support the industry, and every reason to continue attacking it, as she’s done as vice president over the last four years. This election is a fierce battle for power of the United States of America. People and industries and choosing their sides, and if Kamala wins, she might not be so nice to the industries who heavily tried to get her opponent elected president. If Bitcoiners want to see this industry not get attacked like it has these past four years, and see it thrive over the next four years, they need to make their voices heard at the ballot box this November – and, like it or not, they need to vote Republican.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,SHINOBI: Gaza is the most powerful demonstration of bitcoin since Wikileaks,"Wed, 16 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/shinobi-gaza-is-the-most-powerful-demonstration-of-bitcoin-since-wikileak,"What is happening in Gaza, and the fact that Bitcoin is the only way to deliver aid to Gazans at this point, is one of the most powerful demonstrations of what Bitcoin is for in over a decade. ","      BTC For Palestine is the perfect example of an endeavor powered by Bitcoin that strikes right to the heart of what Bitcoin is supposed to be all about. Money functioning without trusted intermediaries. The entire point of Bitcoin was to give people a way to transact with their money that no one could disrupt, insert themselves into the middle of, or rent seek off of. That is the exact situation Gazans find themselves in for the last year. Completely cut off from the rest of the world, incapable of making any form of payment that isn’t using cash without depending on exactly those rent seekers who have inserted themselves in the middle of every digital payment being processed globally. The difference between them and the average Westerner is that they are dependent on aid to simply survive, and meet basic necessities. They aren’t simply annoyed or griping over inconvenient service or annoying fees. These people are being slaughtered as if they were game animals locked in a pen, it is literally systematic genocide. They have been completely cut off from traditional payment rails to accept donations for food, water, and other necessities. Even UN supplied aid is being seized and disrupted. Bitcoin is literally the only option for people who wish to donate money to help people in Gaza with nothing. This is one of the most important demonstrations of why Bitcoin is a necessity in the world since Wikileaks first started accepting it 13 years ago in 2011 in response to the banking and payment processing brigade against them. Back then it was a direct fight over the ability to use information to hold the government to account for their actions and deceptions. Now it is a matter of helping the people directly suffering under the actions of those governments that continue to avoid being held accountable. Yusef Mahmoud, a cab driver before the genocide began, has been able to help buy food and water for thousands of Gazan’s left destitute and with nothing for the last year because of Bitcoin. One man, with a means to accept financial assistance from around the world that no one can disrupt or stop, has been able to make that big of a difference in thousands of peoples’ lives. This is what Bitcoin is for, functioning as a tool to enable us to stand up to what governments and institutions impose on us without their ability to stop that tool from functioning. It’s not simply a new asset class, or a toy for Wall Street, it is a foundation for revolutionary self-organization to solve the problems that governments either can’t, or actively create themselves. It’s for us, not them. You can donate here to help the people of Gaza. "
Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin’s False Dichotomy between SoV and MoE,"Wed, 16 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoins-false-dichotomy-between-sov-and-moe,Bitcoin's use as a store of value or a means of exchange is not mutually exclusive.,"This post is long overdue. I talk about Bitcoin a lot. In any given week, I’ll have dozens of conversations about bitcoin with various people across different sectors. And like a pendulum oscillating every other year, the narrative of bitcoin not being a medium of exchange keeps coming back. I get it. When influencers from the community are pushing this narrative, people listen. They’re influencers. But in this post, I want to set the record straight: Bitcoin IS a medium of exchange, now and in the future. What’s more, its future as a store of value (SoV) depends on its acceptance as a medium of exchange (MoE). Some of the people pushing the (false) dichotomy between bitcoin as a SoV and a MoE are doing it for their own self-interest. Some are just hangers-on.   Since when is buying a coffee the true measure of the future of money? [Image: X’s Grok 2 Mini]  Luckily, these people do not control how bitcoin will continue to develop and be developed. Bitcoin’s future depends on our collective swarm intelligence, and together we’re pretty smart. Here’s the conclusion we will eventually, inevitably reach: the dichotomy of bitcoin is no dichotomy at all. Bitcoin’s durability and deflationary properties are what make it a good SoV. Its divisibility, portability, relative fungibility — along with its decentralization and censorship-resistance — are what make bitcoin a good MoE. But these qualities presuppose each other. Indeed, you can’t have a SoV without a MoE.There Is No Value Without ExchangeBefore determining how the categories of SoV and MoE fit together, we should establish what those terms mean in the first place. While there are conceptual differences between them, neither is really thinkable without the other. There is no SoV without a MoE and vice versa. SoVs Trade Across TimeStores of value need to be durable, and they need to retain their value. So far, so obvious. But what does it mean to “retain value”? How could you tell? There are several ideas about how best to think about value. Marx famously reduced value to labor, so the more labor was invested in producing a thing, the more it would be worth. But this just begs the question: what’s a unit of labor worth? And is a wild strawberry worth less than a cultivated one, even if it’s more delicious?Then there’s “intrinsic” or “objective” value. In finance, intrinsic value means something like the “true” or “objective” value of an asset as distinguished from its market price, which is supposedly distorted by all the market participants and their (mis)perceptions. A company with plenty of quality machines and a positive bank balance would seem to have value even if its shares were worthless. In strict semantics, intrinsic value would mean that the value is inherent, in the essence of the thing. But all value is contextual. In the middle of the desert, a barrel of water is worth more than all the gold in the world. The fastest mining rig ever devised is worth nothing to a sadhu. Family heirlooms like your late grandma’s favorite earrings are worth incalculably more to members of that family than to anyone else. You won’t find their value in their objective characteristics.That’s why many economists and mainstream bitcoiners subscribe to the subjective theory of value. The idea is that there is no value in a transactional vacuum. Value emerges from how people deal with a thing, what they’re willing to trade for it. At some point, aggregate supply will meet aggregate demand – the price – and that’s where the trades will happen. A price is just the value of one thing expressed in a quantity of something else. A Tag Heuer Connected Calibre E4 trades for $1450 USD, which is equivalent to about 0.02 btc, which is equivalent to ... That’s the first important conceptual point about SoVs: unless they are exchanged sometime, they have no real value. They might have notional value, like the value of an imaginary pet dragon, but their real value would never have the chance to emerge.The second point is that all SoVs imply a trade by definition; it’s just that the trade is diachronic. In other words, the trade with a SoV is in the same asset at two points in time. Trade a smaller value of thing A in the present for a larger value of thing A in the future. Same asset, two different times.While we’re thinking about time, consider this: what does it mean for a SoV to appreciate? Its value must be measured relative to something else. In other words, appreciation simply means that its future real price will exceed its current real price; I’ll be able to exchange less of it for more stuff in the future than I can today. Without a trade — even just an unrealized future trade — there is no value.   Many things are two things at once. It just depends how you look at them. [Image: Oleg Shyplyak via Creative Visual Artist]  MoEs Trade Across AssetsMoEs need to be divisible, portable, and fungible. Here the trade is synchronic (at the same time) across different assets rather across time (diachronic) with the same asset. But if MoEs are traded in the present by definition, how short is the present? What’s worth more: owning all the bitcoin that’s ever been mined, but only for one femtosecond, or ten million durable sats? Some amount of value retention and durability is necessary for a MoE to work. For example, cigarettes are used as currency in prison. But cigarettes go stale after a few weeks, so they don’t retain value very well over time. Those who have them are looking to spend them quickly. Ditto shitcoins whose value might collapse next week. You need to take the trade or reject it now. Indeed, durability is one of the characteristics that make gold a better MoE than, say, sodium. Gold resists almost any kind of corrosion, so our descendants will still have the same amount of gold to trade generations from now, whereas sodium can’t even get wet without exploding. So even though conceptually MoEs are exchanged instantaneously in the present, practically speaking they exist in a temporal world of people with finite lifespans, short vacations, and long hours in waiting rooms. A MoE that retains its value is worth more than a perishable MoE, other things being equal. (Interesting wrinkle: when perishability increases scarcity, but let’s not digress.)And MoEs reinforce the subjective theory of value. If no one wants to buy your artisanal pumpkin spice pasta for the price you’re asking, can you say that everyone is wrong? That no one recognizes its intrinsic value or the value of the hours you’ve invested in making it? Of course not. That monstrosity is worth what people are willing to exchange for it, nothing more and nothing less. Without a subjective, contextual theory of value, it’s hard to conceptualize a MoE in the first place.SoV-MoE ConvergenceSo there are a few edge cases on each side, where the properties of the asset recommend it as either a SoV or a MoE. The harder an asset is to trade, the more it would seem like a SoV. The quicker an asset degrades, the more it would seem like a MoE, up to a point. Without some tradability, a SoV is worthless and no longer a SoV. Without some durability, a MoE is worthless and no longer a MoE. But some assets fall more on one side or the other.The middle, however, is far from empty. That’s where you’ll find the really good stuff, like gold, bearer bonds, hard currency, and bitcoin of course. What makes them great is that they share the attributes of both SoVs and MoEs. These assets are more or less fungible, portable, and divisible, just like good MoEs. And their value is durable, just like good SoVs. If people trade them at high velocity, they look more like MoEs. If trades occur at longer intervals, then they look more like SoVs. The substance is the same; it’s the context and the activity that changes how we see them.   Contrast this happy coincidence with the claim of dichotomy. That is, what is bitcoin as a SoV exclusively, i.e. without working as a MoE? Rather than recognize and realize bitcoin’s potential, the SoV-only hypothesis absolves it from ever having to trade. But since value emerges from transactions, never in a vacuum, a SoV that never functions as a MoE has no detectable value. The idea that bitcoin is only a SoV is not even wrong. It’s incoherent. It’s asserting that bitcoin is a store of value while removing it from the only kinds of context that could allow us to determine its value. SoV and MoE are logically and practically inseparable. A SoV is a MoE in transactional slow motion, and a MoE is a SoV with the trading velocity cranked up.But enough theory. This is the way things have always been, or at least as far back as archaeology lets us see. We’ll return to bitcoin in a minute, but let’s look at its family tree first. The coincidence of SoVs and MoEs is an empirical reality that goes back millennia. Storing and Trading Assets Through HistoryBeyond theory, history provides evidence for the convergence of SoVs and MoEs. History contains a host of assets that function as both MoEs and SoVs because if they’re in demand, you can trade them, and if you can trade them, then it’s good to have a stockpile in storage. SoV and MoE are – and always have been — two sides of the same, er, coin.Bronze IngotsThe overlap between SoVs and MoEs is illustrated beautifully by Bronze Age oxhide ingots. These ingots were shaped like oxhides, came in roughly standardized weights (usually around 30 kg / 66 lbs.), contained relatively pure copper or tin, and were passed around all around the Mediterranean and beyond from the second millennium BCE — the Bronze Age. Since everybody was using bronze, copper and tin – the two ingredients of bronze – held their value very well. Everybody could use them. Demand was high and stable. They were also relatively easy to store.   A copper oxhide ingot from Cyprus, aka Bronze Age bitcoin. (Image: The Met Museum)  But they were also relatively easy to transport. A load of ingots found in a shipwreck from 1327 BCE contained metal that originated in Uzbekistan, Turkey, Sardinia and Cornwall. Chariots were still relatively new tech, but these hunks of metal were traversing the known world, farther than virtually any human would have traveled, because they were “connected to systems of international distribution, exchange and trade.” Now let’s say that you’re a Bronze-Age fisherman who comes across a sunken cargo of ingots. Are they a SoV or a MoE? Well, if you’ve had a good season, you might be feeling flush, so you save them for a rainy day, in which case they’re a SoV. If, on the other hand, the fish haven’t been biting and you need some liquidity, then you’d probably trade them quickly, in which case they’re a MoE. But how would you know they were worth saving if they weren’t being traded somewhere to reveal their value? And who could you trade with if there weren’t counterparties out there convinced that owning some ingots around would be a wise financial decision? The oxhide ingots’ durable, high-demand materials made them good SoVs, and their standardized sizes and portability made them good MoEs. The ingots were both simultaneously because each use implies the other. GoldHumans started collecting gold a few millennia before they were into bronze. But at first, gold was principally used for decorative and sacred purposes, like statues and ceremonial jewelry. Since such objects aren’t fungible, they were poor MoEs, and trades were very infrequent. The low trading velocity was due to the impossibility of finding a price: ceremonial objects’ owners would always value them more highly than any counterparty.Standardized gold coins only started showing up around the 7th century BCE, about 1000 years after the ingots. Interestingly, they appeared in China and Anatolia around the same time. As coins, gold had finally become fungible, which increased the trading velocity and brought the SoV and MoE uses closer together. Coins also offered some advantages over oxhide ingots: a coin doesn’t weigh 30 kg, gold doesn’t corrode, and it didn’t have a lot of other uses, so the supply didn’t have to compete with demand for useful stuff like ploughs and swords made of bronze.Gold coins were so effective as both a SoV and a MoE that basically everyone started using them, like the Roman aureus, the Almoravid dinar, the Spanish doubloon, the Tokugawa Koban, etc. Even now, 2600 years later, countries from Armenia to Tuvalu are minting and circulating gold coins for people to keep and trade, to store and exchange.  Ephesians saw gold as a SoV and MoE 2600 years ago, and the idea is rooted so deep that money in video games is often depicted as gold coins even today. (Images: Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. & PNG ALL)  Again, the use of gold coins as a MoE made gold a more obvious and widespread SoV, and their widespread recognition as a SoV made them a more liquid MoE.WampumIn the 17th century, early European settlers on the Atlantic coast of North America and the indigenous peoples of the continent were getting to know each other. The worlds they knew were radically different. No common language, no common religion, no common history, radically different technology, radically different cosmologies. But as humans do, they started to trade pretty quickly. Without commonly recognized SoV-MoEs, though, trading is hard.At first, fur pelts had a certain value, but they’re bulky, their value was not standardized, they can degrade, etc. They were better than nothing as a SoV and MoE, but not ideal as either. Venetian glass beads also worked, but getting beads from Venice to the European colonies in the “New World” could take months, maybe years.Then in 1622 a Dutch trader named Jacques Elekens took a Pequot sachem (like a chieftain) hostage and demanded ransom. The sachem’s people brought Elekens 280 yards (~256 m) of white and purple beads made from clam shells – wampum. Apparently, they hadn’t really used wampum as cash before, and even in this instance the ransom had primarily symbolic value, like ransoming a prince by sending a fancy ceremonial scepter. But Elekens was a trader, and though he missed the transcendent symbolic value of wampum, he saw its profane cash value immediately. If you can buy a chief’s freedom with wampum, what couldn’t you buy? Soon the Europeans were forcing a couple of tribes to produce wampum, and it was traded in units of length, like so-and-so many pelts for so-and-so many fathoms (1 fathom ~ 1.8 m / 6 ft.) of wampum beads.  Wampum and the shells it was made of. Like gold coins and raw gold ore of 17th-century colonies. (Image: Jim, the Photographer)  Wampum quickly became an official MoE. Several colonies adopted wampum beads in standardized values as legal tender, a practice that continued for about a century. And wampum was naturally attractive as a SoV: “the European colonists quickly began trying to amass large quantities of this currency, and shifting control of this currency determined which power would have control of the European-Indigenous trade.” They weren’t just trading with it; they were building currency reserves. They were storing the MoE for its future value, and its future value made it an effective asset to trade today. The words “gold” and “wampum” still mean money in certain contexts. Speaking of money…The USDThe power to create money is enshrined in the US Constitution, and the Coinage Act of 1792 pegged the value of the new dollar to the Spanish silver dollar and a fixed quantity of 416 grains of silver. “Eagles” were effectively $10 coins that were to contain 270 grains of gold. The architects of the dollar were leveraging the historical context that everyone already understood: precious metals work as both MoEs and SoVs. After three and a half millennia, word had got around.As tends to happen with specie, the coins were debased over time, which means that the minters kept gradually lowering the amount of precious metals contained in the coins. That’s how inflation works with a MoE that’s pegged to keep its value as a SoV. You can still mint the same amount at less cost by manipulating the peg.  Technology so good that it saw only minor updates over two and a half millennia. (Image: Lyle Engleson/Goldberg Coins and Collectibles)  The Gold Standard Act of 1900 hardened the peg by making each dollar redeemable for a fixed amount of 25.8 grains of 90% pure gold. So if dollar notes were redeemable for gold, would that make them a MoE or a SoV? The notes circulated, but the US government was committed to storing an equivalent amount of gold to maintain their value. The gold might look like a SoV, and the notes might look like a MoE, but they were equivalent, so it’s only the use that differs, not any deeper nature.When the Great Depression struck, there was a run on the Federal Reserve. People were concerned about the dollar’s continued viability as a MoE, so they started to redeem their dollars for gold. When the Federal Reserve became concerned about its own ability to continue converting dollars for gold, President Roosevelt suspended the gold standard.But, of course, bank deposits didn’t fall to zero, so the dollar continued to function as a SoV and MoE. And people were hoarding gold so they could trade it just in case the dollar did lose its utility as a SoV and MoE. But both dollars and gold retained both functions.The gold standard returned with the Bretton Woods system after the Second World War, but this time the USD was pegged at $35 per ounce of gold, and central banks around the world could exchange their dollars for gold at that rate. This effectively made the USD the hardest currency, and through fixed exchange rates it was supposed to bolster other currencies too. As before, the equivalence through redemption virtually erases any practical distinction between the SoV and the MoE. For a range of complicated reasons that can be reductively simplified down to “inflationary pressure” (i.e. fiat’s own perverse version of “numbers go up”), the USA had to abandon the international gold standard of Bretton Woods in 1971.While this was an important turning point for economic historians, the USD remains both a SoV and a MoE. According to the IMF, about 60% of global foreign exchange reserves are held in USD, about 3x as much as the nearest competitor. Other countries store USD just in case they need to exchange it for their own currency to prop up their own currency’s value or to buy necessities in a pinch. Even without gold backing, demand for USD is astounding. Foreign countries hold $8.8 trillion of American debt — IOUs to be paid in dollars at some point in the future, which looks like a classic SoV. And most international trade is billed and settled in USD. Even in Europe, a continent with its own common currency, over 20% of trade is settled in dollars. The remarkably resilient demand for greenbacks gives the USA as their minter a privileged position. The phenomenon of “petrodollars” illustrates just how the USD has remained dominant since the collapse of the gold standard. Petroleum exporters sell oil for USD, and they rapidly accumulate large reserves of dollars. They need to spend these dollars, and it just so happens that the US is always eager to sell T-Bills (American I.O.U.s) for dollars to finance its $35 trillion in debt. As long as other countries hold that debt, they have an interest in preserving the value of the dollar. As long as the dollar can retain its value, it remains useful for trade. As long as it remains useful for trade, other countries will accumulate dollars and dollar-denominated debt. Sound like a Ponzi scheme? Well, it’s not not a Ponzi scheme.In short, other countries’ foreign reserves of USD let the US trade on a multiple. Hold that thought.Yes, Bitcoin Is a SoV Is a MoEBitcoin is the latest descendant in this lineage of readily tradable SoVs, i.e. of MoEs that people like to hoard because they hold their value. However, there is a widespread, often repeated claim that bitcoin is just a SoV. Indeed, that’s why I’m writing this, and that’s why I feel the burden of proof is on me to demonstrate bitcoin’s viability as a MoE. So far I’ve laid out some theoretical ideas about how SoVs and MoEs are conceptually inseparable and covered several historical examples to demonstrate that this mutual presupposition is how things have worked as far back as history can go. So now let’s turn to bitcoin, which is just new tech following established patterns: MoE and SoV go together because they must.Transactions in the TrillionsWe know bitcoin works as a MoE because people move bitcoin - A LOT. Adjusting for change addresses, River estimates that $14.9T of payments were settled with bitcoin in 2022. So even if 74% of bitcoins don’t move within six months, bitcoin equivalent to the combined GDPs of Germany, Japan, India, and Canada can change hands in just a year. Trading BitcoinThere are about 2.35 million btc in exchange accounts (about $150B). This should be puzzling because autonomy and self-custody are two of bitcoin’s major selling points. If bitcoin is just a SoV, why would anyone entrust it to another party rather than keeping it in cold storage themselves? If it’s a store of value, why wouldn’t you store it as safely as possible, especially considering that decently safe storage can cost as little as a piece of paper?The reason more than one in ten of all bitcoins in existence are held in exchange accounts is to facilitate trading. Exchanges are just that: where people go to trade one asset for another. Bitcoin works beautifully as a MoE for such trades because no other cryptocurrency even comes close to the demand for bitcoin. Whether you go by market cap or unit price, bitcoin is in a league of its own. The only other coin that can compete on any interesting metric is USDT, whose trading volume is roughly double bitcoin’s impressive $26 billion/day. And that is probably because Tether profits from the waning dominance of the legacy global MoE – the USD. If bitcoin were only a SoV, nobody would leave their hoard on an exchange, and the trading velocity would be miniscule. But they do. And it isn’t.Merchants Accept BitcoinSome might object that, while bitcoin might be a MoE among the tech boys of the financial cognoscenti, it hasn’t penetrated the “real economy” the way a “real” MoE should. But examples of bitcoin circulating in the real economy would be enough to refute this claim. We’re in luck.Retailers are using bitcoin as a MoE because it already offers concrete benefits. Take one brilliant example from the recent River report: Atoms, a Brooklyn shoe company. In 2021, Atoms started accepting bitcoin as payment and launched a bitcoin-themed sneaker. Atoms accepts bitcoin as a MoE (consumers pay for shoes with bitcoins), and then Atoms hold it as a SoV until the need arises. And when it does, their SoV bitcoin is automatically tradable MoE bitcoin because it’s the same bitcoin. Atoms proves that the dichotomy is strictly conceptual and misguided. Actual bitcoin is both a SoV and a MoE; it just depends on how its owner happens to be using it at the moment.And Atoms is not alone, not by a long shot. Balenciaga accepts bitcoin. Tag Heuer accepts bitcoin. AMC Theatres, PayPal, twitch, Ferrari, and Proton all accept bitcoin. Is anybody going to claim that AMC or PayPal are niche vendors known only to nerds with obscure financial hobbies? Are these famous, global brands hodling bitcoin as a SoV or trading it as a MoE? There’s that dichotomous thinking again. Bitcoin is a divisible, fungible, durable asset, so they can hold it as long as they want and trade it at any time. They can accept it, spend it, lend it, whatever. Bitcoin has no fundamental essence. It is whatever they/we use it for.  Bitcoin is penetrating the mainstream economy.  All MoEs and SoVs Are Just BetasAnother major lesson from the examples above is that SoVs and MoEs never stop evolving. Bronze Age fintech was about standardizing ingots and purifying the metals they contained (or, for the ruling class, maybe debasing them). How SoV-MoEs are designed affects how we use them, which influences their design, which affects how we use them, and so on. But evolution is always about local optimization, never perfection, so there will always be room for further improvement. Good money has always served as both a SoV and a MoE, and bitcoin still has room to grow. Let’s consider the areas where bitcoin could use further optimization. Fiat’s First-Mover AdvantageIf asked, virtually every friend of bitcoin would prefer to receive their income in btc while paying their expenses in fiat. But this doesn’t mean that bitcoin is defective as a MoE; it means that fiat is defective as a SoV. People prefer to hold bitcoin because bitcoin holds its value better than fiat, so it makes sense to save the bitcoin for tomorrow when it will be worth more and spend the fiat today before it’s worth less.So fiat’s edge is just that it has built up 13 centuries of network effects to compensate for its obvious defects. People know fiat. The world’s payroll systems, tax codes, and banking systems are built around fiat. The world has considerable sunk costs in the fiat project. That’s why it’s so important for bitcoin to exceed fiat in any metric: value retention, autonomy, censorship resistance, and of course…The UX. Always the UX.Bitcoin’s UX is improving. Many innovations are unequivocally ameliorations. The Lightning Network, for example, increases bitcoin’s maximum trading velocity by multiple orders of magnitude.Other aspects of using bitcoin, however, can be features and bugs simultaneously. The most obvious is self-custody. Holding your own bitcoin is really the only way to fully enjoy the autonomy and freedom bitcoin affords, whether as a SoV or a MoE or both. But with great power comes great responsibility, and assessing and implementing different ways to store and use bitcoin can be a bit much for many no-coiners. And even for all its benefits, Lightning has limitations that we’re still trying to overcome. Lightning adds complexity to liquidity management, although LSPs are helping to transform liquidity from a difficult technical problem into a largely automated financial consideration. But friction is friction. Similarly, Lightning can only take on new users so fast because each new user requires at least one on-chain transaction and additional liquidity. New technology, like Breez’s nodeless SDK implementation, can improve Lightning’s throughput and mitigate its liquidity constraints just like Lightning surpasses on-chain bitcoin for some use cases.And if this trend of innovation → UX tweaking → innovation continues as it has for fiat, we’re in good shape. Consider the credit card. Nobody used credit cards for small purchases for the first three decades or so of their existence. It was a big story when Burger King started accepting credit cards in 1993. People even got all judgmental about it. “I think it’s pretty bad if you have to use a credit card when you go to a fast food restaurant.” Credit cards were for big purchases, like airfare, jewelry, hotel stays, and car repairs. In 2024, about a third of payments are made by credit card, and nobody – not a single living soul — cares if you pay for an order of fries or bus fare with a credit card.People in 1993 react to #creditcards being accepted at a #burgerkingAs credit cards became easier to use (it used to be hard work), people used them more and for smaller purchases. The lesson here is that people will use an asset as a MoE selectively if the UX is rocky, using it more frequently and for smaller purchases as the UX improves. Legal/Regulatory TreatmentWe’ve all heard the outdated FUD that bitcoin is basically just for criminals. Proton is a great company that accepts bitcoin and is advised by Sir Tim Berners Lee — not exactly your typical moustache-twirling supervillain. But people fear what they don’t understand, and legislators and regulators love pandering to popular fears.Some jurisdictions are open and progressive. In the EU, for example, bitcoin is considered a currency and is treated accordingly in most laws. Exchanging bitcoin for another currency incurs no VAT, but buying a product or service with bitcoin does incur VAT, just as it would with any other currency.In the US, while some regulators and courts have acknowledged that bitcoin is “a medium of exchange and a means of payment,” the IRS treats it as a property subject to capital gains tax, which makes trading it more expensive and, consequently, slows its trading velocity. So it’s natural that bitcoin might look more like a SoV than a MoE to Americans subject to that tax regime.Some countries like Morocco and China have banned bitcoin outright. Whatever. King Canute tried to stop the tides until his feet got wet, at which point he declared that no king could gainsay eternal laws. That’s a good lesson for the SoV crowd and the staunch bitcoin opponents alike. People want to be free, and they want their money to be free. If you don’t give it to them, they’ll take it eventually.VolatilityMany people might be averse to using bitcoin as a MoE because of its characteristics as a SoV. First, its price is relatively volatile. In the last few years, we’ve seen the value of bitcoin relative to the USD swing up and down by a factor of 4x. This makes it hard for consumers to spend and hard for retailers to accept because the exchange rate of bitcoin relative to a given good — i.e. its price — can be too uncertain. The more disposable income and wealth someone has, the less sensitive they are to volatility. If you still have plenty of income left over every month after taxes, groceries, and mortgage payments along with healthy savings, it won’t matter much if one tranche of your portfolio drops a bit for a few months. You use your assets on a different timescale than price volatility. Long-term gains more than outweigh short-term drops, so let it swing. Many others are not so privileged. Their income is their wealth; they have no savings or surplus to buffer price swings. For them, a sudden drop in the value of their income could mean hungry days at the end of the month. If they obtain bitcoin (and many do), they’re likely to exchange it for a more stable asset as soon as they can.Bitcoin’s volatility is a boon to some, a curse to others, and irrelevant to many. We can, however, see a natural path forward for it to appeal to all user groups. One way to think about bitcoin’s volatility is as a woefully incomplete index. The value of fiat is usually measured by exchange rates to other currencies, by official “baskets” of goods to determine its official purchasing power parity/consumer price index, and by millions of people just transacting in their everyday lives. Each source of information provides a check on the others, triangulating something like a “true market value.” The more people transact and the more goods are priced in bitcoin, the more precise the triangulation, and the less need for price swings.In other words, the more people use bitcoin as a MoE, the more its price curve will stabilize relative to other assets. Even as a speculative asset, it would look more like T-Bills than, say, oil. And vibrant use as a MoE will maintain expectations of its future demand, which, along with its deflationary design, preserves bitcoin’s status as an unprecedented SoV. Greater usage just smoothes the upward curve.Preaching Benefits the PreacherThere’s a bizarre, schoolmarmy undertone in the rants of the SoV proponents. Like, what do they care what we all do with our bitcoin? If SoVs and MoEs necessarily overlap, why lecture everyone that bitcoin is ackchyually a SoV exclusively? Nobody’s hindering their preferred use, so what gives?Remember the US dollar? The USA convinced the world to go long on the USD. If you convince the world to hoard what you’ve already started hoarding, then you’re in a very good position. You’re stoking demand for what you can supply.But you don’t even have to supply it. Convincing others to covet your hoard lets you borrow against it, giving you access to leverage. If your hoard grants you these benefits, it can trade at a multiple. If you have n bitcoins in your hoard, you might be able to sell shares of your hoard at a 3n valuation. You’ve just figured out how to push the inflation rate of a deflationary asset up to 300%. Dastardly, but clever.The beauty of freedom money, though, is that no one can tell you how to use it. Sure, I’m telling you it’s underestimated as a MoE, and I have a vested interest in its use as a MoE, but I’m not telling anyone what to do. I’m describing what I see and debunking some bad, possibly disingenuous claims. Store your bitcoin where and how you want, spend it where and how you want, and its value depends on what we all do collectively, no what some suits do in their exclusionary conclave. Nor does it depend on what some talking head on twitter said is best. Of course, when the majority of the world’s freedom money is held by a select few, then it won’t be very free.Bitcoin is flexible enough for all our diverse needs, and we all have a say in what it is and what it will yet become. Let our diversity be our strength.This is a guest post by Roy Sheinfeld. Opinions expressed are entirely their own and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine."
Bitcoin Magazine,Art Under Surveillance: Ripcache’s Radical Take at Bitcoin Amsterdam,"Tue, 15 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/art-under-surveillance-ripcaches-radical-take-at-bitcoin-amsterdam,"A Q&A on privacy, ownership, and the unstoppable rise of decentralized art in a world of watchful eyes.","Ripcache, a pseudonymous artist, explores themes of surveillance and privacy through a 1-bit pixelated aesthetic. By examining the impact of modern surveillance in centralized and decentralized systems, Ripcache’s work examines trade-offs of the advancing digital age. Their recent series, ""Hyperscalers,"" was featured on the main stage at Bitcoin Amsterdam, with a private sale facilitated by UTXO Management’s OTC desk to collector Brissi, marking a key milestone in their career and the greater ordinals ecosystem.We sat down with Ripcache to discuss his art.Ordinals on Bitcoin create new ways for audiences to engage with digital art. In a world increasingly dominated by surveillance, how does this impact your views on ownership, visibility, and control over art?Ordinals challenge the status quo about ownership and control. In a way, they democratize access to certain forms of art. In the past, a lot of the art world has been about exclusivity. Artwork hidden away in private collections or in storage, accessible only to a select few. This exclusivity is like a centralized database with limited entry.In contrast, inscribing art on bitcoin makes it universally accessible. Sure, you still might not own it, but at least anyone with an internet connection can look at it and verify the work without intermediaries. This accessibility and transparency challenges traditional power structures in art ownership and curation. With that said, in an era of pervasive surveillance, this openness also raises questions around privacy and the potential for art and provenance to be co-opted or misused. It’s a delicate balance between visibility and control and advocating for a future where art is both accessible and respectful of individual privacy (for the artist, collector and wider public).  Lattice, 2024, 1024x1024 pixels, bitcoin ordinal inscription, media fully-onchain.  As technologies like blockchain and AI continue to shape the future of digital art, how do you see the relationship between art and surveillance evolving? Could AI offer an alternative narrative to the surveillance-heavy world we inhabit, or only deepen it?AI and blockchain are actively reshaping our perceptions of surveillance and privacy. While AI does have immense creative potential, in that it can enable new forms of creation and interaction, it also poses risks. The biggest risk is amplifying surveillance capabilities by collecting and processing vast amounts of data, predicting behaviors, and potentially stifling spontaneity.It's tough to say definitively, however. AI could deepen the surveillance state but it also has the potential to offer alternatives. Artists already use AI to explore themes of privacy and identity, reclaiming some control over the narrative. And maybe it’s a bit cliche, but I think crypto and bitcoin provide a counterbalance by enabling decentralized and increasingly more anon interactions. With ordinals, artists can share their work with collectors all over the world without centralized oversight, promoting a culture of openness while safeguarding individual freedoms. As this tech evolves, I think it’s crucial that we actively shape them to enhance rather than diminish our creative and personal liberties.Incorporating motifs like CCTV and drones into your work raises questions about the tension between the peer-to-peer aspect of Bitcoin and the omnipresence of surveillance. Are you concerned that systems meant to decentralize power may still be co-opted by regulatory forces or contribute to an increasingly digital panopticon?The risk of decentralized systems being co-opted is a real concern. My use of motifs like closed-circuit TV cameras and drones is an attempt to highlight this tension. These symbols represent the watchful eyes of surveillance, prompting viewers to consider how technologies intended for empowerment can be repurposed for control.Financial transparency on bitcoin is empowering. It has the potential to hold institutions accountable, but it can also expose personal data if not carefully managed. There's a paradox where increased openness can lead to decreased individual privacy. To prevent decentralization from contributing to a digital panopticon, it’s important to advocate for technologies that prioritize user privacy, like zero-knowledge proofs, and to stay vigilant about regulatory developments.Art can play a role in this discourse by bringing these issues to the cultural forefront and by encouraging proactive engagement with the cypherpunk ethos as well as the second and third order implications of technology."
Bitcoin Magazine,CORVA: Bitcoin Can Reduce Racism,"Tue, 15 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/corva-bitcoin-can-reduce-racism,"Harvard professor Robert Putnam’s research, if extrapolated, shows that identifying as a “Bitcoiner” can actually reduce racism.","     Follow Frank on X.  At face value, the statement “Bitcoin can reduce racism” seems silly, if not downright offensive to those who have been the victims of racism. And it presupposes that an open-source protocol, which is completely indifferent to the whims of human emotions, can have any impact whatsoever on reducing racism, one of the most vile expressions of human emotions.I get that (as much as I can as a white dude), but follow me for a moment. While Bitcoin itself may not be able to reduce racism, what about the concept of being a “Bitcoiner”? Can identifying as a Bitcoiner reduce racism?The work of Harvard political science professor Robert Putnam suggests that this could actually be the case.When Putnam set out to write his now best selling book Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community, he aimed to prove the point that diversity is inherently a good thing.His research proved otherwise, though.The data showed that diversity hurts civic life, as it can lead to distrust between groups of different ethnicities and races. Putnam explained that humans are programmed with ingroup and outgroup bias, which makes us favor those with whom we identify and remain wary of those with whom we don’t.His research showed that it’s not until we find we have something in common with someone beyond our race, ethnicity or even gender that we begin to associate them with our ingroup and that once we find that something we have in common, diversity becomes a strength. That something could be anything from being a part of the same religion to playing on the same softball team to liking the same music.So, what are the implications of this for people who identify as Bitcoiners? Can being a Bitcoiner help people overlook racial differences?While the answer to this question differs on a case-by-case basis, it’s hard to imagine it wouldn’t have some impact. After all, Bitcoiners have aligned incentives, right?We’re all working towards hyperbitcoinization, or, at the very least, we share some of the same values: faith in hard money, belief in the right to transact permissionlessly, belief in the right to be financially self-sovereign.Knowing that we have these things in common creates a bond between us, and it helps us to trust one another more. When we trust one another more, we’re more apt to work together. And it is in collaborating with one another that diversity becomes a strength.This isn’t to say that some who identify as Bitcoiners don’t still have racist inclinations. But there is something to be said about the idea that the things that unite us are stronger than those that divide us, and when you look at the idea of being a Bitcoiner through that lens, it’s hard to deny that the association won’t have some impact on reducing racism."
Bitcoin Magazine,President Harris Should Buy Bitcoin to Pay Black Americans Reparations,"Tue, 15 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/president-harris-buy-bitcoin-pay-black-americans-reparations,A Bitcoin stockpile could be a once-in-a-century chance to pay back reparations without taxation – seriously.,"Not so fast. Let’s take this one seriously.    Vice President Kamala Harris went live with her first crypto-specific policy yesterday, vowing to help protect Black Americans who invest in cryptocurrency. This is standard issue stuff for the Democratic Party in 2024, where as Nik points out, the cause of anti-racism is alive and well.For the sake of argument, let’s even put aside Nik’s more valid critiques. I, too, am concerned that, without policy specifics, a Harris administration could use this policy to prevent Black Americans from the benefits of owning Bitcoin. For now, let’s deal with the very real issue of reparations. The United States is a Democracy, and data shows over 70% of Black Americans feel the federal government should pay them restitution for the suffering of their ancestors (compared to just 12% of white Americans). Three-quarters also believe the Federal government should make the payment.Let’s also consider the fact that, as Harris’s opponent, Donald Trump, has so clearly articulated, Bitcoin is the best chance America has to pay off an exorbitant sum like the $35 trillion national debt. (Trump’s own quote is that we could “pay a little crypto” to absolve the deficit). With some estimates suggesting the value of reparations for slavery to be above $12 trillion, maybe it’s time for Democrats to consider Bitcoin as part of the solution, not as an industry to hold back with onerous regulation.After all, the Trump campaign has already made clear: it believes the treasure trove of over 200,000 BTC (confiscated from dark markets and criminals) is an asset to wield strategically.With this in mind, why shouldn’t the Democrats consider Bitcoin a similar strategic investment, buying and selling Bitcoin for the goals aligned with their voting constituency? Sure, you could argue that using America’s stockpile of Bitcoin should be a bipartisan effort, and that its use should benefit everyone. But clearly, any payment of reparations would require either additional money printing (and currency debasement) or taxation. Paying reparations in Bitcoin (as others have suggested making cash payments to the descendants of slaves) would be convenient and useful, and it would protect these Americans and their wealth from continued debasement by U.S. policymakers. Call it a half-baked idea, maybe. But for the Harris Administration, it could mean fulfilling long broken promises. For millions, the institution of chattel slavery, where Blacks were bought and sold as property, is a painful history that remains real.Like Bitcoin itself, putting this in the past could be a once-in-a-century opportunity.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Blackrock CEO Is Right: Trump and Kamala Can’t Stop Bitcoin,"Tue, 15 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blackrock-ceo-is-right-trump-and-kamala-cant-stop-bitcoin,I’m pleasantly surprised by how accurately BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink understands why politics can't stop Bitcoin's growth.  ,"      I'll admit - just a few years ago, I'd be shocked to hear myself say that the CEO of BlackRock is making good points about Bitcoin. As head of the world's largest asset manager, I assumed Larry Fink would be Bitcoin's biggest critic. But compared to dismissive remarks on Bitcoin from other Wall Street leaders like Jamie Dimon, Fink's perspective is a refreshing change.If you think otherwise, yesterday’s earnings call proves it.There, Fink declared, ""I'm not sure if either president would make a difference"" on Bitcoin's growth,” adding ""I don't believe [Bitcoin's rise] is a function of regulation.""He went on to compare Bitcoin’s growth to much larger markets like mortgages, noting liquidity and transparency drives adoption more than rules.Here's full Larry Fink quote on bitcoin/digital assets from the Q3 earnings call, he says bitcoin asset class in itself, they talking with institutions worldwide about allocation, dig assets remind him of the early days of the mortgage market (now $11T) and POTUS won't make dif pic.twitter.com/McvpW7cCnB— Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 14, 2024  It's wild that the CEO of an $11 trillion company is not just embracing Bitcoin, but that he gets that Bitcoin thrives because it is an apolitical, decentralized, global money.Regulation aside, Bitcoin marches on indifferently. Fink seems to grasp what many Bitcoiners don't – that political winds don't sway Bitcoin's course long-term. Neither Donald Trump or Kamala Harris can stop Bitcoin from setting new all-time highs.Bitcoin thrives on its own technical merits, not regulatory benevolence. This independence was always its promise. Now, the world’s financial giants aren’t fighting it, but joining in. Bullish."
Bitcoin Magazine,Kamala Harris Proves She's the Worst Candidate for Bitcoin Ownership and Adoption,"Mon, 14 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/kamala-harris-proves-shes-the-worst-candidate-for-bitcoin-ownership-and-adoption,"Our expectations for her were low, but holy f*ck.","     Follow Nikolaus On X Here  Kamala Harris announced today she is “supporting a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and other digital assets so Black men who invest in and own these assets are protected.”Nope, that’s not clickbait: Harris’s first specific crypto policy is here, and it’s race-based.As a Bitcoiner, I have to say, this is a huge misstep, and it shows Harris in no way understands Bitcoin, a network where everyone already has equal access regardless of race, color, creed.Harris and the Democrats have for years touted themselves as “anti-racist,” while labeling their opponents and anyone who challenges them as racist. Here, Kamala is extending that policy to crypto, playing favoritism with one specific demographic.Let’s just imagine Trump had come out with an agenda stating he will work on policy that will benefit white people in the crypto industry. The media would be in uproar about it. But, unlike Harris, Trump is not favoring one race of people over everyone else. He is making pro-Bitcoin policies that are for ALL Americans.On this basis alone, Trump’s approach is undoubtedly far better for Bitcoin than the one Harris has proposed: he actually gives specific details on what exactly he would do to foster innovation within this industry if elected, and it explains how these policies benefit everyone.This new rhetoric by Harris appears to be nothing more than just pandering for votes to one group of people, while likely losing votes from the others that she’s excluded. Any voter telling themselves otherwise is lying to themselves.Let’s ask ourselves this, do we think that Harris’s policies will make it easier for Black Americans to access and own Bitcoin? Or do we think that her administration will make it more difficult? If more hurdles are placed on Black Bitcoin buyers, I for one, can’t imagine anything worse.Bitcoin is an open source protocol open to anyone in the world. It does not care what race you are – anyone can use it. This policy is a slap in the face to all American Bitcoiners, and Bitcoin voters should head to the polls in three weeks to make sure she isn’t elected as President.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,CORVA: Welcome To The Empowerment Epoch — Bitcoin As The People’s Money,"Mon, 14 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/corva-welcome-to-the-empowerment-epoch-bitcoin-as-the-peoples-money,"In this, the fifth Bitcoin epoch, bitcoin will be looked at less as a speculative bet and more as a financial life raft for many around the world living in failing or oppressive systems.","     Follow Frank on X.  At this year’s Oslo Freedom Forum, gigabrain Lyn Alden made the case that bitcoin is now liquid enough to be used in a human rights context, a compelling argument and one with which I agree.Bitcoin, which now has a market cap of over $1.2 trillion, is less volatile than it was a decade ago and can now more readily be used to help empower those who’ve historically been financially disenfranchised. (The larger an asset’s market cap, the less volatile the price of the asset tends to become. When bitcoin had a much lower market cap in its early days, it wasn’t uncommon to see it lose over 80% of its value in crashes. For this reason, it would have been much harder to use it in a human rights context back then.)Here are some examples of how Bitcoin is currently being used for human rights purposes:Bitcoin Dada educates African women about how to invest in and use Bitcoin. Many women in Africa live in patriarchal societies in which women aren’t permitted to own property. Bitcoin helps them subvert such rules, allowing them to save in the hardest asset ever known to humanity, with few being the wiser.Bitcoin Dua is a Bitcoin circular economy and a community center located in Ghana in which community members not only learn what Bitcoin is and how to use it but also skills that they can use to obtain jobs in which they can earn in bitcoin. This program is particularly relevant in a country in which the traditional currency was the worst-performing currency in the world in 2022 and continues to fall in value versus the US dollar.A #Bitcoin Education Center is being created in ""Bitcoin Dua"" to teach kids & provide mentorship to individuals on how to use & accept Bitcoin payments in Agbozume.⚡️Your assistance is appreciated as we strive achieve this goals. cc @geyserfund https://t.co/Enb7767ZVN pic.twitter.com/y7ex7Mb6wP— Bitcoin Dua (@bitcoin_dua) June 19, 2023  Lyudmyla Kozlovska, President of the Open Dialogue Foundation, someone who has been debanked by dictators herself, has been making the case to regulators in the United States and Europe that Bitcoin is a money and financial network of last resort for pro-democracy activists living under authoritarian regimes and that the right to use it needs to be protected. She argues that one of the first moves in the playbook of dictators these days is to cut dissidents off from the traditional financial system, leaving said dissidents with Bitcoin as their primary means to transact.The work that these people, programs and institutions and the many others like them have done during the previous Bitcoin epoch has set the stage for the Empowerment Epoch — Bitcoin’s fifth epoch, the one in which it will become synonymous with the term “human rights.”That said, this will not come without challenges.High fees on the Bitcoin base chain will price certain users out of self-custody, pushing them to use Layer 2 solutions like Lightning and extensions of Lightning like ecash, non-traceable versions of sats that can be sent at almost no cost.Companies like Fedi have developed a super app for the Global South that gives users access to Lightning, ecash and other freedom tech, while Machankura enables residents of various African countries to transact with bitcoin in a custodial manner using feature phones (non-smart phones). (Machankura is also working on turning feature phones into Bitcoin hardware wallets.)Layer 2 solutions will not be perfect and there will be tradeoffs with each of them. But even considering the imperfections of the technologies that make bitcoin more usable, they still provide many around the world with access to a parallel financial system, serving as a hedge to the existing monetary and financial systems.As new challenges arise, I have little doubt that organizations like the Human Rights Foundation will continue to bring activists and educators together with developers and entrepreneurs to meet these challenges and to help bring bitcoin — the people’s money — to those who need it most in this, the Empowerment Epoch.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,I Bought MicroStrategy (MSTR) Stock For No Real Reason,"Mon, 14 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/buy-michael-saylor-mstr-stock-for-no-reason,"So, why did I buy MSTR? Short story? Really, I’m just tired of watching the MSTR bulls be right about whatever it is they are talking about.","   The price of MicroStrategy stock surging above $200, the MSTR bulls were out in force last week, insufferably posting about how Michael Saylor’s tech firm, a once dead tech company from the dot-com era, will outperform everything again this cycle.    Look, I’m not going to even start parsing the hokum. You can follow BitPaine, Dan Hillery, or one of the hundreds of Bitcoin X accounts which now comprise the MSTR bull twitterverse. There’s videos, threads, and of course, a lot of people who are irresponsibly long…But the general gist is this:Michael Saylor’s has decided to buy over 200,000 BTC, and to keep buying Bitcoin until the fiat system collapses. He will continue leveraging cheap debt to do this, which he can borrow because this is how the fiat system works, infinite money glitch.This will make his company more valuable than other companies – since it offers exposure to a valuable and scarce commodity (Bitcoin), but with added beta due to the companies existing profitable product suite. Said another way, as the Bitcoin they accumulate gains in value, Microstrategy stock will look undervalued compared to the underlying collateral.Since BTC won’t go to zero, and the Federal Reserve has to keep cutting rates (boosting stocks), this is a perfect storm for MSTR, and it will benefit from the liquidity injection and outperform Bitcoin even as Bitcoin enters its 4-year cycle … blah blah blah.This is my best attempt to repeat this thesis, I wrote it in 2 minutes. I refuse to even copy edit it. The gist is companies that some people believe buying Bitcoin stock can outperform Bitcoin for some reason, and that this isn’t speculation, but morally aligned Bitcoin maximalism, or something…Maybe Dylan LeClair can explain the math to you. He’s tried with me multiple times, and I’ve never understood anything more than the above. Amount of Bitcoin the company owns per share = good. No Bitcoin divided by shares = bad.So, why did I buy MSTR? Short story, I had money in my 401(k) that I can only invest in regulated investments. (Yes, that means I own Bitcoin ETFs as well.)But that’s not really the whole story. Really, I’m just tired of watching the MSTR bulls be right about whatever it is they are talking about, and want some skin in the upside. Should I have done some diligence here? Should I have some hypothesis? Shouldn’t I just be HODLING? Maybe, but have you considered Michael Saylor, bull, bull, bull?"

In a recent interview on the Markets with Madison podcast, Saylor argued that by investing in Bitcoin instead of stock buybacks, companies could significantly boost their market capitalization and protect their reserves from inflation. Strategic bet Saylor used Apple as an example and suggested that the tech giant could invest $100 billion into Bitcoin instead of buying back its stock, a move he believes could add $1 trillion to 2 trillion to its market cap over time. According to Saylor: “If Apple bought $100 billion of Bitcoin, it would likely grow to $500 billion, and the company would have a $500 billion business growing at 20% a year.” He further predicted that such a move would cause the tech giant’s valuation to “shift,” with 40% of it being based on Bitcoin holdings and 60% on its core operations. Saylor’s suggestion is rooted in his long-standing belief that Bitcoin is the future of capital markets and a better store of value than traditional cash reserves. He argued that as companies face inflationary pressures and currency depreciation, Bitcoin offers a more resilient and appreciating asset for protecting balance sheets. He stated: “Bitcoin’s long-term value is undeniable.” Saylor predicted that Bitcoin has the potential to reach $13 million per coin within the next 21 years, and companies should take advantage of the “capital revolution” it brings. Bitcoin yield Saylor has already implemented this strategy at MicroStrategy, which owns 252,220 BTC worth over $16 billion, making it the largest corporate whale in the industry. The company has been issuing Bitcoin-backed securities to fund its accumulation strategy, generating a “BTC yield” — an innovative financial metric that has led to an 18% increase in Bitcoin per share for its investors this year. MicroStrategy’s BTC yield strategy involves issuing equity and convertible bonds at a premium and then using the proceeds to buy more Bitcoin. This creates consistent growth in the company’s Bitcoin holdings while providing shareholders with returns that outpace traditional investment models. Saylor said: “In one year, we’ve generated more value from issuing Bitcoin-backed securities than we could have in a decade of traditional operations. BTC yield allows us to compress time and deliver results faster.” Saylor believes that companies like Apple could open new avenues for growth by adopting this approach. By leveraging their cash reserves to accumulate Bitcoin, firms could achieve substantial gains over time while mitigating inflation risks.

The rally is supported by forecasts of Bitcoin’s price surging toward $70,000, driven by favorable regulatory developments and political backing.  Increased inflation expectations and rising government spending due to geopolitical tensions are also contributing to this bullish outlook.  #Bitcoin is looking to break 68k again and push to 70k If this happens I’ll giveaway 0.1 $BTC(~$7,000)Interact for good luck  #Crypto pic.twitter.com/zjHEbP3vCS— PERC.eth  (@Corroboratorr) October 16, 2024  Adding to this momentum is the anticipation of Donald Trump’s potential election victory, which has further brightened Bitcoin’s future prospects.

Jonathan de Wet, chief investment officer at Zerocap, highlighted a strong technical breakout as a key factor pushing Bitcoin higher, positioning it for further gains. Political dynamics in the U.S. are also contributing to Bitcoin’s bullish outlook. Former President Donald Trump’s pledge to transform the U.S. into a global crypto hub, advocating for users’ rights to hold their digital assets, has bolstered confidence among investors.  #Bitcoin Set to Rise Beyond $70,000 in 'Coming Weeks,' Experts Say: #Bitcoin's upward momentum remains robust, with some market experts forecasting a rise beyond its March all-time high. https://t.co/aA92KfjXQY Spotted for you— News by Amanda (@amandasome) October 17, 2024  Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, added that escalating geopolitical conflicts, particularly in the Middle East, are likely to drive inflation and government spending, which could fuel the next major Bitcoin bull run.

He suggests that other companies, especially smaller ones in the S&P 500, could see enhanced performance by adopting Bitcoin investment strategies similar to major tech firms. As institutional interest in Bitcoin grows, bolstered by endorsements from figures like Saylor, Bitcoin’s price could continue its upward trajectory, with forecasts suggesting it may hit $70,000 and potentially reach $100,000 by the end of the year. Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance at $68,400 with Potential Downside to $66,625 Bitcoin (BTC/USD) trades around $67,650, supported by a strong upward trendline that has maintained the bullish momentum. This trendline has been a key technical level, preventing significant declines in recent sessions.  However, a break below this upward channel could result in a bearish correction, pushing the price towards the $66,625 support level, with the next critical support at $65,750. Traders should consider these levels as potential points where further downward movement could stall.On the upside, Bitcoin faces immediate resistance around the $68,400 mark. A break above this resistance could signal the resumption of the bullish trend, pushing prices towards the next resistance level at $69,140 and potentially beyond.  The market is currently neutral, as reflected in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 54, indicating there is room for further upward movement.

A stronger US dollar, as indicated by the Dollar Index (DXY) reaching three-month highs, briefly pushed Bitcoin to an intra-day low of $66,759. However, Bitcoin has managed to maintain a bullish stance amid these challenges. With the US presidential election approaching on November 5, both candidates have highlighted cryptocurrency, boosting Bitcoin’s prominence. As of October 17, Bitcoin posted a notable 10.59% gain over the past week on foreign exchanges, driven by increased interest in Trump-backed WLFI tokens and optimism around potential crypto-friendly regulations. In addition, rising investment in Bitcoin ETFs, which have seen over $19 billion in net inflows, has reinforced market confidence.

Although uncertainty remains, the fundamentals suggest that Bitcoin’s rally is far from over.

Matt Hougan’s Bullish Outlook: Bitcoin Could Reach $200,000 by 2025 Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, forecasts that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by 2025.

Hougan outlines three key drivers for his outlook: the impact of the US elections, the rise of new investors, and the long-term benefits of spot Bitcoin ETFs. He notes that while election-related uncertainty may cause some hesitation, more investors will ultimately recognize the staying power of cryptocurrency.

Wright asserts that Bitcoin SV preserves the true design of Bitcoin, seeking £911 billion in damages in a controversial legal battle.The postCraig Wright Files Lawsuit Against Bitcoin Core Developers, Claims Bitcoin SV is True BTCappeared first onCryptonews."," Australian scientist Craig Wright has taken legal action in London’s High Court of Chancery, suing Bitcoin Core developers and asserting that Bitcoin SV, his version of Bitcoin, is the genuine cryptocurrency, according to a Friday report from Forbes. Wright, known for his controversial claims within the cryptocurrency space, argues that Bitcoin Core developers have misrepresented Bitcoin by implementing modifications such as SegWit and Taproot, which he claims deviate from Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision. Wright’s latest lawsuit has caught the eye of the crypto comm unity, largely due to past UK rulings that dismissed his claims of being Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Despite losing that case, Wright continues to pursue legal action in an attempt to establish Bitcoin SV as the legitimate version of Bitcoin. Wright’s Lawsuit and Allegations In this latest legal action, Wright claims that Bitcoin SV upholds the true vision of Bitcoin and asserts that the changes made to Bitcoin by the Core developers have damaged the reputation and market position of Bitcoin SV.  He is seeking £911 billion in damages, attributing this staggering figure to the price disparity between Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin SV (BSV). Wright’s allegations focus on the idea that by modifying Bitcoin with features like SegWit and Taproot, Bitcoin Core developers have steered the currency away from Nakamoto’s original design, which Wright claims Bitcoin SV has preserved.

Despite ongoing legal battles, Wright’s lawsuit has coincided with notable movements in Bitcoin SV’s price. Craig Wright’s Lawsuit Boosts Bitcoin SV Price Amid Controversy Bitcoin SV’s price rose by 3% to $51.69 following news of the lawsuit, even as its trading volume decreased by 25% to $38.33 million.  In addition, BSV futures open interest increased by 5%, reaching $22.21 million. While these price movements may suggest a short-term boost for Bitcoin SV, the broader crypto community remains largely skeptical of Wright’s legal actions.  Prominent figures, such as Hodlonaut, a vocal critic of Wright, continue to mock his lawsuits.   “Hodlonaut, who has previously won a defamation case against Wright in Norway, criticized Wright’s latest legal action. In a statement made to Forbes, he said, ""When no reputable law firm is willing to keep representing his torrent of lies and forgeries, it is very much in…— hodlonaut (@hodlonaut) October 18, 2024  Hodlonaut, who previously won a defamation case against Wright, sarcastically remarked, “Wright might be using ChatGPT to craft his legal claims,” they added, mocking Wright’s ongoing legal efforts.

The fact that almost half a million citizens now use BTC in their daily life for transactions is pretty impressive, but the Lindy effect means we can expect this figure to increase with time.Considering the history of El Salvador, it was obvious from the beginning that the entire country was not going to start using this new payments technology from day one. El Salvador has a history of failed currency regimes. It takes time for any new system to build trust.As I pointed out three years ago, I believe Bitcoin needs to become a store of value first before it can become a medium of exchange. Bitcoin today, even with it being a $1.4 trillion dollar asset, is still just a drop in the ocean compared to vast global wealth. There is still a common consensus in the general public that Bitcoin is risky to get into, and that will need to change before more people in more countries start using it on a daily basis.   Bitcoin is still a new asset class that is growing up. The more it grows up, the more credibility it earns, the more price increases, the more innovation happens that sprouts new transactional and custody solutions to meet non-technical people where they are.This will take a long time, but it’s a process that is underway.I see many Bitcoiners online who are so bullish that they believe that adoption as an everyday transaction method will happen suddenly over the next few years, but this discounts real-world data, like this survey, which shows the process is much slower.All this is to say that if Bitcoin is going to see worldwide merchant adoption and use by everyday individuals, we’re going to need to see a much higher price, Bitcoin will need to be easier to use, and more trusted than it is today. Exactly how long will it take? I don’t know for certain. But if you think of it as a loading bar, we’re already 7.5% complete on our way to 100% of Salvadorans transacting in Bitcoin.Remember, this is progress. Nothing happens overnight.This article is a Take. Opinions expressed are entirely the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine."

Bitcoin Magazine,Can Bitcoin Now Make A New All-Time High,"Fri, 18 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/can-bitcoin-now-make-a-new-all-time-high,"Key Psychological Barriers: Bitcoin's Fight at $70,000","Bitcoin has been steadily climbing since crossing the $60,000 mark and is currently hovering closer to the $70,000 level, a price it hasn't reached in months. With the market sentiment heating up, investors are wondering whether Bitcoin has the strength to reach new all-time highs or if it will struggle to break past key resistance levels.A Healthy SentimentThe Fear and Greed Index is a useful tool for understanding market sentiment and how traders view the trajectory of Bitcoin. Currently, the index is at a ""Greed"" level of around 70, which is historically seen as a positive sign but still a fair distance from the extreme greed levels that could indicate a potential market top. This index measures emotions in the market, with lower levels indicating fear and higher levels suggesting greed. Typically, when the index surpasses the 90+ range, the market becomes overly bullish, raising concerns of overextension.  Figure 1: Fear & Greed Index shows a healthy positive sentiment. View Live Chart 🔍  It's important to note that last year, when the Fear and Greed Index reached similar levels, Bitcoin was trading at around $34,000. From there, it more than doubled to $73,000 over the following months.Key SupportThe Short-Term Holder Realized Price measures the average price new Bitcoin investors have paid for their bitcoin. It's crucial because it often acts as a strong support level during bull markets and as resistance during bear markets. Currently, this price sits around $62,000, and Bitcoin has managed to stay above it. This is a promising sign, as it shows that newer market participants are in profit, and Bitcoin is holding above a crucial support zone. Historically, breaking below this level has led to market weakness, so maintaining this support is key to any continued rally.  Figure 2: Short-Term Holder Realized Price has been reclaimed. View Live Chart 🔍  We’ve seen this dynamic in past cycles, especially during the 2016-2017 bull market, where Bitcoin retraced to this level several times before continuing its climb. If this trend holds, Bitcoin’s recent breakthrough could provide a foundation for further gains.Stabilizing MarketOne area that traders often watch is Funding Rates, which indicate the cost of holding long or short positions in Bitcoin futures. Over the past few months, funding rates have been volatile, swinging between overly optimistic long positions and overly bearish short positions. Thankfully, the market has now stabilized, with funding rates sitting at neutral levels. This is a healthy sign as it suggests traders aren't overly leveraged in either direction.  Figure 3: Futures markets have de-leveraged and have reset to healthy levels. View Live Chart 🔍  In neutral territory, there's less risk of a liquidation cascade, a common phenomenon when over-leveraged positions get wiped out, causing sharp market drops. As long as the funding rates remain stable, Bitcoin could have the breathing room it needs to continue rising without major volatility.A Tough Path to $70,000 and BeyondWhile the market sentiment and technicals suggest that Bitcoin is in a healthy place, there are still significant levels of resistance above. First, the current resistance trend line is one that Bitcoin has struggled to break. This downtrend line has been tested several times, but each time, Bitcoin has retraced after hitting it.Beyond this, Bitcoin faces several additional barriers, such as $70,000. This level has acted as resistance in the past and represents a psychological level that traders will likely be watching closely. And above that the all-time high between $73,000 and $74,000. Breaking this would be a major bullish signal, but it could take several attempts before Bitcoin clears this level.  Figure 4: Bitcoin has significant resistance at $70,000 and above.  One positive technical element is the recent reclaim of the 200 daily moving average. A key level for investors to watch that had acted as resistance for BTC over the previous few months.The Macro Environment: Institutional and ETF InflowsBeyond technical indicators, the macro environment is increasingly favorable for Bitcoin. Institutional money continues to flow into Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). In the past few days, over $1 billion has flowed into Bitcoin ETFs, reflecting growing confidence in the asset. Over the past few weeks, we've seen hundreds of millions more in ETF inflows, signaling that smart money, particularly institutional investors, is bullish on Bitcoin’s future.  Figure 5: Bitcoin ETFs have experienced large-scale inflows recently. View Live Chart 🔍  This is significant because institutional money tends to take a long-term view, providing a more stable base of support than retail speculation. Moreover, as equities and even gold have been gaining ground in recent months, Bitcoin appears to be lagging slightly behind. This could set the stage for Bitcoin to play catch-up, particularly if investors rotate from traditional assets into the more risk-on realm of Bitcoin.ConclusionBitcoin's price action, funding rates, and sentiment all suggest that the market is in a healthier place than it has been in months. Institutional inflows into ETFs and improving macro conditions add further bullish tailwinds. However, significant resistance lies ahead, and any rally will likely face challenges before Bitcoin can truly break out to new highs.For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out a recent YouTube video here:Can Bitcoin Now Make A New ATH"

The BTC halving slashes the earings of miners by half every four years — a deflationary mechanism that also helps maintain the hard cap of 21 million Bitcoin. Public miners like MARA Holdings, Riot Platforms, and CleanSpark are holding the BTC they mine in the hope that its value will increase over time. Wolfie Zhao, an analyst at research firm TheMinerMag, told Bloomberg: “By avoiding the immediate sale of Bitcoin at a loss, they [miners] can keep potential losses unrealized and position themselves for gains if a bull market materializes.” However, the strategy that is popular with crypto mining stock traders is an investment in AI. For instance, the stock of Core Scientific nearly quadrupled since it announced the signing of multi-billion-dollar contracts with AI startup CoreWeave. Core Scientific emerged from bankruptcy with a successful restructuring earlier this year. At the same time, stocks of MARA and Riot, who are betting on holding BTC, have dropped by 20% and 36%, respectively, this year. Similarly, shares of Iris Energy and Bit Digital, which have been investing in AI, have been faring better than those holding BTC. The strategy of holding BTC seems feasible since miners like MARA and Clean Spark run profitable operations. Besides, in a market with rising Bitcoin prices, the strategy appears to be a good one. In fact, with the market rising, Bitcoin miners have again started borrowing and issuing more shares. And those like MARA are using the funds to buy more crypto, following in the footsteps of MicroStrategy. However, Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at Luxor Technology, a Bitcoin mining software and services firm, sounded a warning. He said: “In a rising Bitcoin price environment, it is going to be an extremely successful strategy, but it’ll be a disaster if Bitcoin prices plummet…You will continue to see negative profits and they are hiding how bad the industry is right now and how bad their operations are by diluting shareholders and buying newer machines.” The post Post halving, Bitcoin miners are choosing between hodling BTC and upgrading to AI appeared first on CryptoSlate.

Crypto Slate,Institutional demand and rising ETP flows signal Bitcoin breakout – VanEck,"Sat, 19 Oct 2024",https://cryptoslate.com/institutional-demand-and-rising-etp-flows-signal-bitcoin-breakout-vaneck/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is set for a potential breakout as increasing institutional investment, growing miner holdings, and rising exchange-traded product (ETP) flows signal mounting demand, according to VanEck’s latest Bitcoin ChainCheck report. The report also highlighted that the growing influence of institutional adoption in the Bitcoin market has strengthened the correlation between ETP flows and BTC price. […]The postInstitutional demand and rising ETP flows signal Bitcoin breakout – VanEckappeared first onCryptoSlate.","Bitcoin (BTC) is set for a potential breakout as increasing institutional investment, growing miner holdings, and rising exchange-traded product (ETP) flows signal mounting demand, according to VanEck’s latest Bitcoin ChainCheck report. The report also highlighted that the growing influence of institutional adoption in the Bitcoin market has strengthened the correlation between ETP flows and BTC price. ETP correlation Data from the report showed that weekly net inflows into US Bitcoin ETPs reached $19.4 billion by mid-October, with institutional inflows driving much of the price discovery process. The correlation between weekly ETP inflows and Bitcoin returns was notably strong, with an R² value of 0.3422. This indicates that institutional money is increasingly leading rather than following Bitcoin’s price movements. The R² value is an indicator commonly used to determine how a model fits data and predicts future outcomes. VanEck head of digital assets research Mathew Sigel said: “Institutional participation, through these investment vehicles, is having a clear impact on price, reinforcing Bitcoin’s position as a key asset in the global financial system.” The report also found that daily ETP flows have shown modest predictive power for Bitcoin price changes in after-hours trading, further underlining the influence of institutional inflows. VanEck’s analysis revealed that during specific periods from July to September, the relationship between ETP flows and Bitcoin returns strengthened, demonstrating how US market momentum is spilling over into the 24/7 global crypto markets. Macro-hedge VanEck stated that Bitcoin is increasingly being recognized as a “macro-hedge” against economic instability and market volatility. The report pointed to Bitcoin’s growing appeal among institutional investors seeking to protect their portfolios from inflation, currency devaluation, and geopolitical uncertainty. Many see Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional financial market fluctuations, similar to gold, but with added benefits like liquidity and digital accessibility. Recent trends in miner activity and corporate treasury strategies have reinforced this narrative. The report noted that US-listed miners added 2% to their Bitcoin treasuries in September, following an 11% surge in August. This growing accumulation of BTC, coupled with an 8% rise in corporate treasury investments, demonstrates robust institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. According to Sigel: “Publicly traded miners and major corporations, including Japanese real estate manager Metaplanet, continue to accumulate Bitcoin, reflecting its rising status as a store of value.” stated Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck. Market sentiment and dominance Market sentiment around Bitcoin has improved significantly, with nearly 90% of Bitcoin addresses now in profit. The unrealized profit/loss ratio has risen by 6% over the past month, indicating a more optimistic outlook compared to the summer months. Additionally, Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market has increased to 57%, reaching levels not seen since April 2021. This rise in market share further strengthens Bitcoin’s status as the leading store of value within the crypto ecosystem. The report also highlighted Bitcoin’s resilience in various regulatory environments, particularly as U.S. regulators, including the SEC, increase scrutiny of non-Bitcoin digital assets. Bitcoin, by contrast, has remained largely insulated from this pressure, reinforcing its role as a safer asset. In terms of regional trends, US and European traders have been the primary drivers of Bitcoin’s price performance, with the asset gaining 2% during US trading hours and 4% during European sessions over the past month. Meanwhile, the long-standing pattern of Asia selling Bitcoin to US and European buyers remains intact and has been a consistent factor in price movements, with demand from Western markets often offsetting selling pressure from Asian markets.

Wright alleges that recent upgrades to Bitcoin’s (BTC) protocol have deviated from its original design and caused financial harm. He is seeking more than $1 billion in damages. BTC vs. BSV The case centers on protocol modifications introduced through Taproot and Segregated Witness (SegWit), which Wright claims have misled the public into believing that Bitcoin maintains its original attributes. According to Wright: “These changes have caused confusion in the market and have compromised the vision of the original Bitcoin protocol.” Wright is pursuing compensation based on the value difference between Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (BSV), a digital asset he claims is the true continuation of Bitcoin. As of Oct. 10, Bitcoin was trading at $62,000, while BSV stood at $65. Wright’s lawsuit seeks $1.18 billion in damages, arguing that Bitcoin Core’s upgrades have undermined his version of the flagship crypto. Legal history The latest lawsuit marks another chapter in Wright’s long history of legal disputes, many of which have centered on his controversial claim of being Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Despite previous rulings against him, Wright continues to pursue legal challenges, this time representing himself in court. His efforts to prove his claim as Satoshi have been met with skepticism, with multiple courts ruling against his assertions in recent years. His previous court losses include one in 2022, where he was unable to cryptographically prove he holds the private keys associated with Bitcoin’s genesis block, a critical element in verifying Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity. Another occurred in 2023 when a court ruled that he had no legitimate claim to the Bitcoin whitepaper, and the latest was earlier this year when a UK court ruled that he was not the Bitcoin creator and ordered him to stop pursuing further lawsuits related to his identity as Satoshi.

In a social media post on Oct. 18, Hougan highlighted a surge in exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows, heightened by a reacceleration of investments into Bitcoin-based financial products amid heightened institutional interest in digital assets. Growing appetite Bitcoin, the only crypto valued at over $1 trillion, has demonstrated resilience and growth amid increasing demand from both institutional and retail investors. The flagship crypto climbed back near all-time high prices and was trading just shy of $69,000 as of press time Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently highlighted that US spot Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed $20 billion in net flows, with the broader Bitcoin ETF sector managing over $65 billion in assets. The rapid growth, achieved in less than a year, has far outpaced traditional asset-tracking ETFs like gold, which took six years to reach similar levels. According to Hougan, the growing appetite for Bitcoin ETFs signals a shift in market sentiment, especially as institutional players seek exposure to digital assets. Elections and rate cuts Hougan, along with other industry analysts, also pointed to next year’s US presidential elections as a potential catalyst for Bitcoin’s price. Former President Donald Trump has taken the lead in on-chain betting polls, which has added to speculation that the political landscape could further drive Bitcoin adoption due to his vocal support for the industry. Additionally, Hougan highlighted bipartisan agreements on escalating fiscal deficits, dubbing them “infinite deficits.” The agreements would continue a loose fiscal policy that could weaken fiat currencies, making Bitcoin’s deflationary nature more attractive to investors. Meanwhile, economic stimulus measures in China, combined with global interest rate cuts by both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, are expected to further fuel demand for Bitcoin, as low-interest-rate environments encourage risk-on behavior in financial markets. Supply shock Hougan also noted that the post-halving supply shock is “starting to bite” as whales and ETFs continue to accumulate Bitcoin. On-data shows that large Bitcoin holders have been accumulating at unprecedented rates, with whale wallets now controlling 9.3% of the total supply. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant data revealed that new Bitcoin whales have invested nearly $108 billion as of Oct. 6, representing a 13x increase this year. These new whales now account for 48.8% of Bitcoin’s total realized cap. This marks the highest amount ever spent by these investors, nearly matching the $113 billion held by “old whales.” The surge in new whale participation is seen as a “generational shift,” and their realized cap is expected to soon surpass that of older whales. Realized cap, which measures the value of each Bitcoin based on its last transaction price, is used to assess the value stored in Bitcoin.

The rally follows the SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETF options, which has increased liquidity and spurred institutional investment. This development, combined with rising interest in spot Bitcoin products like BlackRock’s ETF—attracting over $1.05 billion in five days—has driven the price surge. Moreover, the approval sets the stage for potential short squeezes, adding further pressure for upward movement. SEC Approval of Bitcoin ETF Options Spurs Market Liquidity On October 18, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved applications for options trading on spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from the NYSE and CBOE.  This move greenlights options for 11 ETF providers, including BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, and ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF.

Bitcoin Price Consolidates Below Key Resistance at $69,000 Amid Neutral RSI Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing consolidation around $68,200 after reaching an intra-day high of $68,986. The cryptocurrency faces immediate resistance at $68,990, with additional barriers at $69,780 and $70,520.  On the downside, immediate support lies at $67,985, with subsequent levels at $67,445 and $66,640. BTC remains above its 50-hour Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $67,980, indicating continued bullish sentiment.  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is holding steady around 53.8, suggesting neutral market conditions with room for potential upward movement. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview For a bullish continuation, Bitcoin needs to break the immediate resistance at $68,990.  However, failure to maintain support at $67,985 could indicate a deeper retracement towards $67,445. Investors should monitor these key levels for potential breakouts or corrections. Key Insights:  Immediate Resistance: $68,990; Next Resistance: $69,780 Immediate Support: $67,985; Next Support: $67,445 Technical Indicator: RSI holding at 53.8 indicates neutrality, with a bullish bias  Maintaining momentum above the 50-hour EMA will be essential for further price advances. – You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034  Crypto All-Stars Presale Nears $2.6M as Bitcoin Adoption Drives Investor Momentum As Bitcoin continues to gain traction globally, Crypto All-Stars is nearing a significant milestone in its presale.

Bitcoin Magazine,Shielded CSV Protocol 🛡️ ,"Wed, 23 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/shielded-csv-protocol-,"A revolutionary design for blockchains, compatible with Bitcoin ","IntroductionBitcoin development today focuses on two major issues: (1) scaling and (2) privacy. The usual proposals to Bitcoin involve adding new opcodes and scripting tools. But an old idea is coming back, one that could make transactions more private and peer-to-peer. Right now, every Bitcoin transaction is broadcast to the entire network for verification. It’s an effective way to prevent double-spending, but it also means more information is exposed than is strictly necessary. This leads to heavier computational demands, higher costs, and a system that struggles to scale. But what if moving part of the transaction process client-side didn't just improve efficiency, but also unlocks a whole new era of privacy on Bitcoin?In our recently published paper, Blockstream, in collaboration with Alpen Labs and ZeroSync, we introduce the Shielded CSV Protocol, an improvement on Client-Side Validation (CSV) that offers truly private transactions. This new protocol is a significant step towards enhancing the privacy of Bitcoin transactions and has the potential to increase transaction capacity from 11 per second to over 100 per second, through some additional measures we’ll cover in this blog post. This post offers a high-level overview of the Shielded CSV Protocol, which aims to advance layer one blockchain performance while remaining fully compatible with Bitcoin. Developed by the combined minds of Jonas Nick, Liam Eagen, and Robin Linus. Here’s the backstory on Shielded CSV, and why it has the potential to change everything.Bitcoin Then and NowThe Double-Spend Problem: How Bitcoin Solved ItBefore Bitcoin, it was widely believed that creating a reliable digital currency was impossible without a trusted middleman. The double-spend problem meant there was no way to ensure a “digital coin” couldn’t be spent more than once. It was a fundamental flaw that kept digital currency from becoming a reality. Then, in 2009, Satoshi addressed this problem by introducing the shared public ledger called the blockchain. Instead of relying on a single trusted authority, Bitcoin uses a network of nodes on a shared public ledger, where every transaction is recorded and verified. This system ensures that each coin is unique, making it impossible to spend the same coin twice.When a Bitcoin transaction is added to the chain, it follows this process:The user’s wallet signs the transaction and broadcasts it to the Bitcoin network.Full nodes on the network validate the transaction, ensuring everything checks out.The transaction is then included in a block, confirmed, and permanently recorded in the shared public ledger.During validation, nodes verify that the coins exist, check the validity of the signature, and enforce the critical double-spend rule—making sure each coin is spent only once. The whole purpose of this ledger is to maintain order, showing clearly who owns which coins and when they moved.The purpose of the ledger is to keep transactions in order, making it clear who owns what coins and when they were sent.Since its inception, Bitcoin’s developers keep coming back to the same question: is this really the best and most private way to handle transactions? How can we make this system leaner, more efficient, and more private?A Privacy Problem: Public TransactionsBitcoin's biggest privacy challenge is that bitcoin transactions are out there in the open on the blockchain. Satoshi saw this vulnerability from the beginning. In the original whitepaper, he suggested a straightforward solution: users should create new keys for each transaction and avoid reusing addresses. The idea was to make it harder to link transactions back to a single owner. But in practice, with all the advanced chain analysis methods available today, maintaining privacy is much harder than it seems. Even with new addresses, linking transactions and identifying patterns has become easier for those intent on tracing user activity.In response, privacy-focused protocols like Zcash have introduced novel ways to conceal transaction details using more advanced cryptography and things like zk-SNARKs. But these methods come with significant trade-offs: transactions are larger, making the verification process for nodes more resource-intensive and expensive to verify.A Communication Problem: Communication is Inefficient In Bitcoin’s design, mining serves two fundamental purposes: (1) proof-of-publication for transactions and (2) providing a consensus on the order of transactions. However, Bitcoins’ system also intertwines these core functions with less essential tasks, like transaction validation and coin issuance. Across all blockchains, whether it’s Bitcoin, Ethereum, Zcash, or Dogecoin, the transaction process always looks the same: wallets sign transactions, broadcast them to the network, and full nodes validate them. But is validating every transaction directly on the blockchain really necessary?We think there’s a better way. The idea traces back to a 2013 insight, when Peter Todd first mentioned Client-Side Validation. In this mailing list post he asks, ‘Given only proof-of-publication, and a consensus on the order of transactions, can we make a successful crypto-coin system? Surprisingly, the answer is yes!’Instead of requiring every full node to verify every transaction, CSV allows you to send coins with proof of their validity directly to the recipient. It means that even if a block contains an invalid transaction, full nodes won’t reject it. The result? Less on-chain communication and a more efficient system overall. CSV: A Peer-to-Peer Scaling SolutionCSV shifts the responsibility of transaction validation from every node in the network to the individual transaction recipients. This makes Bitcoin even more peer-to-peer. Imagine if we didn’t have to use the blockchain to store full transaction details. Instead of a detailed, identity-linked transaction, you’d only see a simple 64-byte nullifier, completely meaningless to anyone looking at the public record on the blockchain, but significant to the sender and recipient.When every node is required to verify every transaction, it congests the network and slows it down. By shifting transaction validation to the client side, the amount of data stored on the blockchain can shrink significantly—from 560 weight units (WU) on average to something approaching 64 WU, which is about 8.75 times smaller, making the system leaner and more efficient. The compliance protocol gives Bitcoin a massive scalability boost, allowing users to process nearly 10 times more transactions—close to 100 per second.Bitcoin TomorrowYou’re probably thinking, “This all sounds great, but how does this actually work, and what are the trade-offs here?”How Does Shielded CSV Make Bitcoin More Private?CSV protocols generally improve privacy over transparent blockchain transactions because some information is moved client-side. But in traditional CSV protocols like RGB and Taproot Assets, when a coin is sent, both the sender and receiver can view the full transaction history. In Shielded CSV, we use zk-SNARK-like schemes to “compress” the proofs, ensuring that no transaction information is leaked. This means that the transaction history remains hidden, offering better privacy compared to existing protocols.What is a Nullifier, and How Does it Prevent Double-Spends?When making a payment, the sender hands the transaction directly to the receiver. A small piece of data derived from the transaction, gets written to the blockchain which is called the nullifier. Full nodes in the network are only required to perform a single Schnorr signature verification per Shielded CSV nullifier. The receiver checks the coin’s validity and makes sure the nullifier is on the blockchain to stop any double-spending. Other CSV protocols have nullifiers too, but in many cases they are full Bitcoin transactions, and not derived “random blobs” as we have here. Shielded CSV nullifiers make it harder to do chain analysis. Does Shielded CSV Require a Soft or Hard Fork?Shielded CSV doesn’t require a soft or hard fork. It works with Bitcoin as-is. CSV separates transaction validation from the consensus rules, allowing flexibility without changing the core protocol. Since Bitcoin blocks can store any type of data, different CSV protocols like RGB, Taproot Assets, or multiple versions of Shielded CSV can coexist without conflict.Nodes don’t have to reject blocks containing unfamiliar data. Instead, they only need to interpret the data on the “client-side” if it’s relevant to them. By offloading transaction verification, the blockchain’s primary role is reduced to: confirming transaction data in an agreed-upon order and preventing double-spends.Does Shielded CSV allow me to Transact in Bitcoin?Shielded CSV operates as a separate system, using the Bitcoin blockchain to record nullifiers and prevent double-spending within the CSV protocol. But to integrate it directly with Bitcoin and allow seamless transactions, a bridging solution is still needed. The current protocol doesn’t dive deeply into how bridging with BitVM could function, but this area is a development that is still under active research.Right now, bridging is possible through the use of a trusted party or a federation, but the end goal is a fully trustless system, one that eliminates the need for any intermediaries. Achieving this would mean true, seamless interaction between Bitcoin and Shielded CSV, allowing users to enjoy enhanced privacy without compromising on the trustless values of Bitcoin. It’s a complex challenge, but one that could redefine how Bitcoin scales and secures its transactions.Read the Full PaperThe Shielded CSV Protocol offers an approach to improving Bitcoin's scalability and privacy, potentially bringing in a new era of more efficient, peer-to-peer transactions. By offloading transaction validation to the client side, it significantly reduces on-chain data, allowing for greater transaction throughput and enhanced privacy—all without requiring a hard or soft fork. If you’re curious to read more about how this protocol works and the trade-offs involved, I highly encourage you to read the full paper, “Shielded CSV: Private and Efficient Client-Side Validation”.

Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Is No Fait Accompli,"Wed, 23 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/bitcoin-is-no-fait-accompli,"Bitcoin is no longer the experimental new project it was over a decade ago, but it can still fail.","     Follow Aaron on Nostr or X.  Perhaps the biggest cultural shift in my eleven years in Bitcoin has been the transition from tinkering techies emphasizing “don’t invest more than you are willing to lose”, to the Michael Saylors of this world telling everyone to sell their house, car and wife (and then go into debt) to buy more bitcoin.Whenever I listen to the macroeconomic commentators in this space (who for the most part started popping up some five or six years ago), I usually feel there is one key point they keep missing. Sure, Bitcoin is no longer just the experimental new project it was over a decade ago— but it can still fail.The list of things that could go wrong is too long to include in this Take, but suffice to say they include everything from too much centralization to too much decentralization. (If —say— mining centralizes too much, Bitcoin can be regulated to death. While the project could literally and figuratively fall apart if people can’t even settle on a single set of consensus rules; something we came uncomfortably close to during the block size wars.)I do think Bitcoin can overcome these problems. The incentives for Bitcoin to succeed are strong, and —perhaps more importantly— smart and motivated people from around the world can help figure out solutions for whatever challenges Bitcoin may face.But in order to do that, the problems need to first be acknowledged, and then fixed. Selling your house, car and wife to simply buy and hold bitcoin is not going to do it.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Prediction Markets Are Pricing In A Trump Victory. This Is Good For Bitcoin,"Tue, 22 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/prediction-markets-are-pricing-in-a-trump-victory-this-is-good-for-bitcoin,"If prediction markets are correct, then pro-Bitcoin Trump is a shoe-in for the White House.","     Follow Nikolaus On X Here  Earlier today, Vivek discussed why he thinks crypto native Polymarket, the world’s largest prediction market, is biased towards Trump in this upcoming U.S. presidential election. While it is plausible given the arguments he laid out, I still believe that it may not be as biased as he may think.First and foremost, prediction market traders are betting on these odds to make money, not swear loyalty to their preferred politician. Traders are looking to make a profit and are trying to lock in their bets at attractive odds on who they think will win. Based on many factors, like positive incoming GOP voter registration data in swing states like Pennsylvania, there are signs that show Trump has a very solid chance of winning this election. Even billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller said that the recent positive upswing in markets is due to the markets pricing in a Trump victory. Like Vivek, many claim that since Polymarket is crypto native, then of course its users support Trump because he is also pro-Bitcoin and crypto. So let’s take a look at another, non-crypto native, market predictions platform, Kalshi. On Kalshi, a U.S. betting odds platform that settles contracts in dollars, not Bitcoin or crypto, Trump is also in a massive lead. Trump is currently up by 20% over Harris. The crowd of users on this platform appear to be choosing their bets on who they think will win the election, even putting aside their own personal political preferences. Reading the comments, I’m seeing many people say they want Trump to win, but are taking the other side of this bet as they believe there may be election fraud from the Democrats which would see Harris ‘win’.“Y'all betting on Trump haven't priced in the probability of delivery vans pulling into the polling stations at 3am with 10's of thousands of ballots, 99% of which going to Kamala they suddenly ‘found,’” commented one user. “Kamala will win legitimately or not, you have been warned.”   It will be fascinating to watch how these prediction markets play out as we inch closer to the election, which is now only two weeks away. I agree with Vivek that as we get closer to the election, these margins will likely get narrower. It appears to me that Trump has got this one in the bag, but it ain’t over until it’s over. Last election most people went to sleep thinking Trump had won the election, just for the Democrats to find all these ballots voting for Biden at 3am to win him the election. If there is any election fraud and interference in this upcoming election, these prediction markets may be in for a very volatile time.A Trump win would be massive for Bitcoin on a regulatory level and price wise, due to his proposed policies. Under Harris, on the other hand, the future of Bitcoin in this country would be uncertain, as she has not laid out any real details on policy she would implement while as president and has a four year track record of attacking the industry while in office as vice president.Bitcoin Magazine is teaming up with Stand With Crypto to provide real time election coverage on November 5th. So if you’re a Bitcoiner tired of watching mainstream news and want to witness this election from the perspective of a Bitcoiner, make sure to tune into the stream.

Bitcoin Magazine,A Spoonful of Bitcoin: How Mary Poppins Awakens Us to Financial Sovereignty ,"Tue, 22 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/a-spoonful-of-bitcoin-how-mary-poppins-awakens-us-to-financial-sovereignty-,"In Mary Poppins, Mr. Banks' journey from rigid conformity to joyful liberation mirrors the transformative power of Bitcoin. As he discovers that true wealth lies in freedom, we too are invited to rethink our relationship with money and embrace the financial sovereignty that Bitcoin offers.","     Follow Mark on X.  In the heart of London, amidst the smog and the burgeoning industrial age, a story unfolds that is as relevant today as it was over half a century ago. Mary Poppins, a tale woven with magic, whimsy, and a touch of surrealism, unexpectedly serves as the perfect allegory for the financial liberation movement epitomized by Bitcoin.At its core, Mary Poppins is a narrative of transformation and enlightenment, primarily seen through the eyes of Mr. Banks, a staunch advocate of traditional financial systems. His journey, however, is not merely one of personal redemption but symbolizes a broader awakening to the pitfalls of centralized financial institutions and the virtues of financial self-sovereignty and liberty.In the character of Mr. Banks, we see the embodiment of the traditional financial system: rigid, hierarchical, and intrinsically tied to the practices of fractional reserve banking. This system, as critiqued through the film's narrative, perpetuates a cycle of debt that disproportionately affects the younger generations, symbolized by Michael. It's a system where the power lies with the few, and the many are left to navigate its consequences.Enter Bitcoin. In stark contrast to the centralized control of traditional banking, Bitcoin offers a decentralized, peer-to-peer system that champions the principles of self-sovereignty and financial equality. It's a system where individuals, much like Michael, can take control of their financial destiny, free from the whims of institutional gatekeepers.The crux of Mary Poppins lies in Mr. Banks' epiphany. He realizes that true wealth is not measured in gold or banknotes but in freedom, liberty, and the well-being of his family. This transformation mirrors the ideological shift required to embrace Bitcoin. It's about breaking free from the conditioning that has long tied society to trust-dependent and inflation-prone financial systems.By opting for Bitcoin, individuals like Mr. Banks can reclaim their financial autonomy. They are no longer at the mercy of institutions that, by nature, operate on a foundation of trust and permission, often at the expense of those they serve.Michael's rebellion against the traditional banking system, opting instead for a model that values equality and self-sovereignty, reflects the growing disillusionment with traditional financial systems. Bitcoin, and the technology underpinning it, represents a beacon of hope for a fairer, more inclusive financial future.The film's narrative suggests that the future belongs to those who dare to challenge the status quo, much like the early adopters of Bitcoin. It's a call to action, urging us to reconsider our relationship with money and the institutions that control it.Mary Poppins is more than just a children's movie; it's a parable for our times. In the transformation of Mr. Banks, we find a powerful metaphor for the shift towards Bitcoin and the principles it stands for. This story encourages us to question, to dream, and to seek a world where financial systems serve the many, not the few.As we watch Mr. Banks fly a kite with his children, we are reminded of the potential for joy and liberation in breaking free from traditional constraints—much like the freedom found in the adoption of Bitcoin. It's time to take control of our financial futures, to opt for a system that empowers us all, much like Michael did.Let us take inspiration from Mary Poppins and embrace the change that Bitcoin represents. After all, sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith and a spoonful of innovation to find our way to a brighter, more liberated financial horizon.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,The Metric That Matters for the Lightning Network,"Tue, 22 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-metric-that-matters-for-the-lightning-network,A look at a valuable metric for measuring the effectiveness of the Lightning Network in routing payments.,"The Lightning Network is a revolutionary scaling solution for Bitcoin, enabling fast and inexpensive payments that make everyday transactions with Bitcoin possible. As the network grows, it’s essential to measure its health and efficiency accurately, so we can unlock its full potential.Traditional metrics like node count, channel count, and capacity have been used to assess the Lightning Network, but they only tell part of the story. To truly understand the performance of this second-layer solution, we need to focus on flow—specifically, Max Flow, a metric with a long history of optimizing complex systems.Max Flow: The Key to Understanding Lightning’s HealthMax Flow is a powerful metric that calculates how much value can theoretically flow through a network, considering constraints like channel capacity and liquidity. It’s an essential tool for evaluating network effectiveness and reliability, particularly in systems where smooth, uninterrupted flow is the key to success.Max Flow has been used for decades in industries ranging from telecommunications to logistics. It’s already been applied to solve problems in:Telecom Networks: Max Flow helps allocate bandwidth efficiently, ensuring that data flows seamlessly across the internet.Supply Chains: Companies use Max Flow algorithms to optimize the movement of goods across their global distribution networks, reducing delays and maximizing efficiency.Transportation Systems: Cities apply Max Flow to traffic management, ensuring that vehicles move smoothly across road networks by optimizing flow through intersections.These examples showcase how Max Flow improves efficiency in complex systems where resources need to move quickly and efficiently. Now, it’s being applied to the Lightning Network as seen in new data science research from René Pickhardt about feasible lightning payments. Applying Max Flow to the Lightning Network will help ensure that Bitcoin can flow smoothly between users, even as the network scales.Max Flow isn’t about measuring the actual movement of value, but rather about understanding the probability of feasible payments across the network. By focusing on Max Flow, we gain a more accurate understanding of the Lightning Network’s true health. Instead of just counting channels or capacity, Max Flow shows us the likelihood of payment success, allowing node operators to optimize their liquidity and improve the overall performance of the network.  Max Flow provides a curve of Payment Reliability by Payment Amount, showing how success probability changes with different payment sizes for the network and specific nodes of interest.  Traditional Metrics Fall ShortMetrics like node count, channel count, and capacity provide a snapshot of the Lightning Network’s infrastructure. But much like counting the number of roads or intersections in a city, these numbers don’t tell us how well traffic is flowing. In the case of the Lightning Network, what really matters is how efficiently Bitcoin can be routed through the system.Critics who focus solely on these traditional metrics often draw limited conclusions about the network's performance. While it’s important to know the size of the infrastructure, it’s far more valuable to understand the probability of successful payments.Max Flow offers that deeper insight. By measuring the success probability of payments, it helps us see where liquidity is well-distributed and where bottlenecks might be forming. This enables operators to make data-driven decisions that improve the network’s performance and ensure that payments are routed reliably.Max Flow Shows Lightning’s Performance Rises with Bitcoin PriceThe Lightning Network is designed to scale with Bitcoin, offering fast and cheap transactions without overloading the Bitcoin blockchain. As Bitcoin’s price appreciates, the network's capacity to handle larger payments grows naturally.For example, if a channel holds 0.1 BTC and Bitcoin is priced at $50,000, that channel can route a $5,000 payment. If Bitcoin’s price doubles to $100,000, that same channel can handle $10,000—without any changes to the underlying infrastructure. As the bitcoin digital economy grows, so too will the capabilities of the Lightning Network. Bitcoin price increases coupled with data-driven changes to the Lightning Network will help expand the capabilities of Lightning.Max Flow plays a critical role here, helping to measure the success probability of payments as the network scales. It provides an essential tool for monitoring payment reliability and ensuring that the network remains efficient as demand for Bitcoin transactions grows.  The network payment reliability increases as bitcoin’s price appreciates from $50,000 to $100,000 assuming no changes to the Lightning Network.  Max Flow is the Future of Lightning MonitoringMax Flow is the next-generation metric that will help drive the Lightning Network forward. By moving beyond superficial statistics like capacity or node count, it offers node operators and investors a more accurate picture of the network’s performance. This, in turn, helps them make smarter decisions about liquidity allocation and payment routing.For investors, Max Flow offers a more reliable measure of network health, revealing the underlying potential of the Lightning Network. Those who focus on Max Flow will gain deeper insights into the scalability and efficiency of Lightning, positioning themselves to capitalize on future growth.For node operators, understanding Max Flow means being able to optimize their channels for better performance. It helps them manage liquidity more effectively, ensuring that payments flow reliably, and improving the user experience for those interacting with the network.Conclusion: Max Flow is the Metric That MattersAs the Lightning Network evolves, Max Flow will be essential to its health and performance. While traditional metrics like node count and channel capacity offer a limited view of the network, Max Flow reveals how efficiently value can move through the system—a critical insight as Bitcoin grows and the demand for reliable payments increases.Max Flow is more than just a new way to measure the network—it’s the key to unlocking the Lightning Network’s full potential. By focusing on the metrics that matter, node operators and investors can help the network scale smarter, ensuring that Bitcoin’s role in the global economy continues to expand.TL;DRTraditional metrics like node count, channel count, and capacity don’t provide a full picture of the Lightning Network’s performance.Max Flow is the right metric to assess network health, as it evaluates the probability of feasible payments and liquidity optimization.As Bitcoin’s price appreciates, the Lightning Network’s capacity to handle larger payments grows naturally, and Max Flow helps monitor this process.Max Flow has proven its value in optimizing complex networks in industries like telecommunications, supply chains, and transportation.Max Flow will play a critical role in helping the Lightning Network scale efficiently, making it an essential tool for both investors and node operators.This is a guest post by Jesse Shrader.

Open-source project (not a company)Bitaxe’s founder, who goes by the nym Skot, has taken his hobby of tinkering with electronics and not only transformed it into a full-time gig but has catalyzed thousands to follow his lead.Harnessing his training as electrical engineer and his Bitcoin enthusiasm, Skot began deconstructing Bitmain’s Bitcoin mining machines approximately two years ago. After gaining a better understanding of how they work, he reverse engineered one, creating the blueprint for Bitaxe — the first ever open-source ASIC-based Bitcoin mining machine — in early 2023.“It was just a technical challenge initially,” Skot told Bitcoin Magazine.That technical challenge has transformed into something bigger than he ever could have imagined, though. Skot created a low-power and affordable Bitcoin miner that anyone can plug in at home without running up a huge energy bill, while his work also paved the way for others interested in open-source Bitcoin mining to begin contributing to Bitaxe and other open-source mining initiatives like it (and related to it).“The project has morphed into something that's bringing mining back to the open source fundamentals of Bitcoin itself,” Skot said.“I've really become convinced that to be truly decentralized, which I think most people understand Bitcoin needs to be, all aspects of the development of Bitcoin needs to be open source,” he added.“It needs to be open so that anyone who's even remotely interested can get in.”Skot’s Journey To BitaxeYears back, while taking liberal arts courses at a community college, Skot stumbled on an issue of Make Magazine, a publication that features tutorials for DIY electronics projects. A switch flipped inside of him as he perused the magazine.He completed a degree as an electrical engineer and then co-founded a design consultancy for Internet of Things (IOT)-related products, which he ran for 10 years. Skot enjoyed the work, but admitted that the downside was that he was constantly working on other people’s ideas.In 2011, a friend introduced him to Bitcoin at a party — showing him how to use bitcoin to buy drugs on the now defunct Silk Road. While he was intrigued, it wasn’t enough to get him to buy bitcoin (or drugs) at the time.Two years later, Skot learned about Bitcoin mining, and, soon after, built his first Bitcoin miner.“I actually built a FPGA Bitcoin miner,” recalled Skot. “FPGAs were the precursor to ASICs.”FPGA miners were designed with open-source code, making it easy for Skot to figure out how to construct one.While he lost all of the bitcoin that he mined in a pool hack, he didn’t become discouraged. In fact, he became more fascinated with this cross section of electronics and the permissionless nature of Bitcoin.“When I was learning about it, I was like, ‘Well, okay, so these are the rules of how Bitcoin mining works, but who made these rules? Who enforces these rules?’” recounted Skot. “Learning that no one is at the center of this and no one enforces these rules — or we all do — was mind-blowing. It's a beautiful thing technically, and that intrigued me,” he added.A few years later, he dove in deeper and developed the Bitaxe.What is Bitaxe?A Bitaxe is technically just open-source code that anyone can use to build a physical mining machine.The bitaxeGamma is go! The newest member in the #bitaxe lineup features the BM1370 ASIC from the Antminer S21 Pro. So far we've been able to pull 1 - 1.2 TH/s at around 15 J/TH from a single chip 🤯We've got #bitcoin global freedom money to secure here, so everything is open… pic.twitter.com/cxWC70EThy— skot (@skot9000) August 19, 2024  Skot has only built about a dozen Bitaxes himself, while thousands have been built and sold. Anyone can build and sell Bitaxe’s under its open-source license.The circuit board for physical Bitaxes isn’t much bigger than a credit card, while the device’s fan protrudes out about 3 cm from the board. (There are different versions of Bitaxes that vary slightly in size.)The machine runs on a 5 volt power source and connects to the internet over WiFi. Users interface with Bitaxes via their personal computer or phone. The devices use between 12 and 18 watts of electricity, which is comparable to an iPad charger.Running a Bitaxe full-time should only increase users’ energy bill by a few dollars per month (this varies based on jurisdiction), and it costs less than what running a Bitcoin node costs to run.The odds of finding a block with a Bitaxe are infinitesimally low (though, a Bitaxe did find a block this past July), but users can direct the hash power they produce with their Bitaxe to almost any mining pool for smaller payouts.Ideally, Bitaxes are used to decentralize the hashrate, though this will, in the end, only lead to really meaningful decentralization if mining pool centralization decreases along with it.“My hope is that by decentralizing the number of brains that are operating these things that enough people will make different decisions,” explained Skot. “If we can exponentially increase the number of different brains and all the crazy ways that they think, I think they will pick different pools.”Bringing more of these brains in was part of Skot’s motivation creating Bitaxe (which I’ll touch on more in just a moment), while another part of his motivation was simply to bring a new kind of Bitcoin mining machine to market.Bitaxe vs. Industrial Bitcoin MinersMost Bitcoin mining equipment is built for the major players in the industry.“99.9% of the Bitcoin mining hardware that's out there is designed specifically for being used in an on-grid data center,” said Skot. “They're all designed to be plugged into the grid and operate full power 24/7 on industrial power.”Skot explained that while this is great for industrial miners who tend to point their hash power at the big mining pools, it does very little for the Bitcoin enthusiast who wants to contribute to the hashrate.He also shared that ASIC chips aren’t currently sold independently of Bitmain miners and that it’s difficult to understand how the chips work, because the machines in which they operate are designed with closed-source code.“We have essentially just one chip maker right now when it really comes down to it — that's Bitmain,” said Skot.“They're really far ahead of the pack, but I don't think that advantage they have is going to last forever. I think some of these other chip makers will come up,” he added.While Skot is patiently waiting on the ASIC chip that Jack Dorsey’s Block is developing, which will be able to be used in any mining device, he continues to work on open-sourcing the Bitcoin mining stack so that it’s easier to compete on the ASIC market.“Let's open source as much of that stack as we can, because, like we saw with the internet, random people can do cool stuff in their garages that sometimes turns into a market standard,” said Skot.And he should know, as he created a new standard in Bitcoin mining in his figurative garage with the Bitaxe just over a year and a half ago, which has led to many others following his lead.“I've been doing it for about a year and a half, and it's growing exponentially,” said Skot. “My goal is to keep up this exponential growth.”The Open-Source Mining MovementAfter receiving a grant from OpenSats early this year, Skot has been able to focus full-time on Bitaxe and the community that’s formed around the project.“When I first started this, I met some random person on Bitcoin Talk who was like ‘I'm going to start a Discord group, and it's going to be called Open Source Miners United — you should come check it out,’” explained Skot.Start this Discord group the gentleman did, and it now has over 4,000 members, all of whom share ideas for how to further Bitaxe and the broader open-source mining movement. But Open Source Miners United (OSMU) has become even bigger than just a group in which people share ideas.“It's been set up so that anyone who wants to contribute to the Bitaxe project can do so, whether it's a random person who wants to donate or the manufacturers of Bitaxe that contribute back to the project,” explained Skot.“OSMU has this fund, this treasury now that's growing because we're selling lots of Bitaxes, and we provide small grants to other people working on open source mining,” he added.Skot also shared that for every Bitaxe sold, approximately $5 is donated to OSMU, which helps to financially support both himself and OSMU grant recipients. (He stressed in a follow-up email that this practice is totally optional and that he is very appreciative of the manufacturers that choose to do this.)The Future For Bitaxe and Open-Source Bitcoin MiningThe Bitaxe and open-source mining movement has taken on a life of its own, according to Skot. That is, Skot doesn’t necessarily feel that he’s at the center of it anymore — it’s become decentralized. And while he’s excited about the pace at which the movement is growing, he’s still grounded and mission-focused.He hasn’t created a roadmap for what comes next for Bitaxe and the community he helped found, though he is quite sure of what the aim of his work is.“I've been so intrigued and motivated to promote this idea that Bitcoin is fundamentally open source,” said Skot.“This decentralized network needs to be developed in a decentralized way. We can't have one without the other. So, I think this open-source part is so important,” he added.“Bitcoin mining has somehow just totally forgotten about the open source ethos of Bitcoin and how important open-source development is. We've got to bring this back.”"
Bitcoin Magazine,World's Largest Prediction Market Polymarket Is Trump Biased ,"Tue, 22 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/worlds-largest-prediction-market-polymarket-is-trump-biased-,"It's clear that Polymarket leans pro-Trump, and you should be aware. ","      Seeing Bitcoin's price rally as Donald Trump takes the lead on the world’s largest prediction market, Polymarket, made me do some research on what Polymarket is and who uses it. And now I have to say — I believe that Polymarket leans pro-Trump. We need to account for that bias, and here’s why.Let's look at some data. Polymarket shows Trump surging to a massive 28% lead over Harris. Another prediction marketplace, Kalshi, also shows Trump leading by 18%. Meanwhile, most other polls have a tight race. This huge skew makes no sense - unless Polymarket's user base is disproportionately pro-Trump.JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Pro-#Bitcoin Donald Trump takes the biggest lead in the election so far, up by 28.8% in the odds: Polymarket pic.twitter.com/0m1FOG2pNL— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 22, 2024  Which it is. Polymarket only allows crypto betting and blocks US users. This filters its audience toward offshore Bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts or US crypto users who use VPNs, and studies show that crypto users tend to lean conservative. And with Trump pledging to Implement crypto-friendly policies, he is a no-brainer for Bitcoin and crypto users. Some add that Trump's bets are part of ""a coordinated effort to change the perception of this race.""This may also be the case, but it should be clear that Polymarket polls are biased. Does this make Polymarket corrupt? I don't think so. It offers insightful predictive data and it's a free market platform where anyone can bid if they think otherwise. Which makes it one of the best tools to know the market sentiment. But anything showing Trump or Harris with a massive lead at this point in the election should warrant scepticism. Traders can recognise and exploit this bias. I'd look to buy Harris, anticipating the race tightening as election day nears. Polymarket odds should normalise closer to even odds.In summary, Polymarket caters to Trump-friendly Bitcoin and crypto crowds, which distorts its election odds substantially compared to other polls. Knowing this, some people can capitalise accordingly.This article is a Take. Opinions expressed are entirely the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine."
Bitcoin Magazine,MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor Reveals His Bitcoin MSTR Plan,"Tue, 22 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/microstrategy-ceo-michael-saylor-bitcoin-master-plan,"Some argue self-custody, if nothing else, is the core of Bitcoin, the fact that you can trust no one but yourself to hold and safeguard your wealth.  ","""It’s mostly paranoid crypto anarchists that say that.""   With these eight words, issued on the “Markets with Madison” podcast, Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor evoked outrage from just about everyone in Bitcoin. Shinobi called him a “spook.” Carvalho was confused. Svetski claimed this will start the next Fork Wars.Put simply, Saylor said a bad thing. He broke the taboo. He said you’re better off trusting your Bitcoin in state custody than holding your own private keys, then went further, calling out all of the businesses engaged in custody projects by calling them effectively bullshit salesmen. It was, shall we say, a “big oof,” a “footgun,” the scene in the cartoon where the hero gets hit with an anvil. Here’s Adam Simecka’s clip from the full video:Saylor thinks you are a paranoid crypto anarchist if you hold your own keys and don't trust the government. 😏 pic.twitter.com/6owj7LzrdM— Adam Simecka (@AdamSimecka) October 20, 2024  Yet, paradoxically, I’ll admit, it’s probably the most interesting thing Saylor has ever said? For years, Saylor and the Cyber Hornets have been “Grut and the Minions,” Saylor using his pulpit to spout whatever bullish nonsense was in vogue, without adding anything of his own. Other people said things, and then Saylor said them again. He was the “people’s champion,” a “man of plebs,” a role that even his mundane AI generated tweets seemed to underscore in tagging the artists, invariably some random pseudonym. So, anger aside, I have to say, at this time, I’m undecided. Sure, as someone who lived through the Fork Wars, I find Svetski’s position romantic (It’s nice to think we’re in the midst of some larger struggle), but it’s perhaps too early to cry wolf.Instead, I find myself (for once) actually trying to understand what Saylor is saying. As far as I can tell, there’s really three ideas at play here: This is a new thesis for how to boost Bitcoin adoption using public markets – Saylor is framing the self-custody question as not an issue to solve with innovation, but an issue to ameliorate. His view: It doesn’t matter how people own Bitcoin, only that they do. His preferred vehicle for this is the stock market, and he seems to want to co-opt it as a massive vehicle for buying Bitcoin and selling the exposure.This thesis actually might solve the problem of how to fight the crypto market – This is also one of the more compelling things about Bitcoin “Season 2,” the idea you could “co-opt the crypto apparatus” as a means of getting retail involved. Here, Saylor seems to want to marshal his army of Bitcoin stocks for the purpose, his view retail will begin purchasing Microstrategy and Metaplanet, in lieu of memecoins, chasing as they always do, beta on Bitcoin.It’s a novel thesis on convincing government to adopt Bitcoin – A world where Bitcoin is the reserve asset for regulated entities seems like one in which draconian laws become less viable. After all, in this world, Bitcoin would have a direct link to the U.S. economy (at least the version most politicians care about). You have to admit: “You can’t ban Bitcoin, it will hurt the stock market,” has a nice ring.Of course, maybe the commentators are right. Saylor’s incentives seem to be departing from the network. Maybe he is placing his company and its quest to amass Bitcoin above all else, and it’s worth questioning his motives at this moment.Some argue self-custody, if nothing else, is the core of Bitcoin, the fact that you can trust no one but yourself to hold and safeguard your wealth.Then again, in Saylor's view, inflation is the true boogeyman, the debasement of purchasing power, the far bigger issue.Is it possible this is a giant government psy-op, that Saylor flew too close to the sun, and there are an army of regulators who are twisting his arm to say this? Sure, Microstrategy does work with intelligence agencies, but even then, intelligence agencies and their pension funds need somewhere to invest. A hyperbitcoinized world is surely one where these funds will also buy Bitcoin.But I have to say, as someone who has never found Saylor very original… for now, I’m at least paying attention. I’ll start there.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,6 steps to move an old 401k into a bitcoin IRA,"Mon, 21 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/6-steps-to-move-an-old-401k-into-a-bitcoin-ira,The latest guide from Unchained offers step-by-step instructions on transferring your 401K or IRA ahead of the next bull run.,"Bitcoin could be on the verge of a major new bull run. According to Tuur Demeester of Adamant Research, in his publication How to Position for the Bitcoin Boom, we may be in the early stages of a new multi-year bull market that could propel bitcoin prices into six figures.“During this accumulation phase, we expect bitcoin to trade in a range of $22,000 to $42,000, until a new multi-year bull market pushes it well north of $120,000,” Demeester noted.Imagine securing a substantial allocation of bitcoin before this bull run begins—an allocation that could appreciate completely tax-free, funded by an old retirement account that you might have totally forgotten about!Step 1: Purchase hardware walletsThe first step is obtaining the tools you need to ensure your bitcoin is secure. A hardware wallet allows you to store your bitcoin keys offline, giving you full control of your funds. Begin by purchasing a couple of hardware wallets, such as those offered by Trezor or Ledger. Unchained currently supports a range of devices, including the Ledger Nano X, Trezor Model T, and Coldcard Mk4. Check out the full list of hardware wallets Unchained supports. For optimal security, it’s recommended to buy directly from the manufacturer, but purchasing from a trusted third-party retailer, like Best Buy, is also acceptable. This is especially true in the context of multisig which eliminates any single key as a single point of failure. Make sure to get at least two wallets—you’ll need both to set up your Unchained IRA vault.Step 2: Create an account on Unchained.comNext, go to Unchained and create an account. The process is simple: provide your name, email, phone number, and create a strong password. Unchained takes your privacy seriously.Once your account is created, select the type of account you need—in this case we’re creating an IRA account. If you prefer personalized assistance, consider opting for Unchained’s Concierge Onboarding, where a bitcoin custody expert will guide you through every step.Step 3: Create your Unchained IRA account—with no setup or account fees for the first year!Now it’s time to set up your IRA account. With an Unchained IRA, you can save bitcoin in a tax-advantaged manner while maintaining full control of your keys. There is no third-party risk because you hold the keys—ensuring that no one else can access your bitcoin.Setting up an account is straightforward—there are no setup fees, account fees don’t start until the second year, and you can see trading fees on our pricing page. Unchained’s IRA offers both Traditional and Roth options, allowing you to choose the best fit for your retirement strategy.Step 4: Follow the Self-Service guide for vault setupAfter setting up your account, it’s time to set up your multisig vault—one of the most secure ways to secure bitcoin. Multisig requires more than one key to authorize a transaction, which mitigates the risks associated with custodian and exchange hacks, bad business practices, or individual mistakes.You can set up this secure multisig configuration in under an hour using Unchained’s Self-Service Onboarding. Simply follow the guide at diy.unchained.com to get started—if you’re using two hardware wallets to build your vault, you’ll choose the Lead custody model.Step 5: Roll over your existing 401k/IRANext, you’ll need to fund your new IRA, and there are a few ways to do it: an IRA-to-IRA transfer, a 401(k)-to-IRA rollover, or an annual contribution. The most common method is rolling over funds from an existing 401(k) or IRA into your new Unchained IRA.While this process can feel tedious—particularly if your 401(k) administrator needs to issue you a physical check—it is straightforward. Once you receive your funds, Unchained will convert them to bitcoin with our trading desk and deposit them into your IRA vault.If you already hold bitcoin in another IRA, you can do an in-kind transfer to move your bitcoin directly to Unchained without converting to cash first. If you want to learn more about how to fund your IRA, we have a full Knowledge Base article for that.Step 6: Enjoy the benefits of tax-advantaged bitcoinCongratulations—your retirement savings are now secured in bitcoin! Unchained offers flat annual fees. Starting in year two, you’ll pay a flat $250 annual fee for your IRA account.Holding bitcoin in a tax-advantaged account combines the inflation resistance of bitcoin with the benefits of an IRA. Most importantly, you remain in charge of your bitcoin—not an exchange or third party. If the bull run is approaching as many suspect, the Unchained IRA could put you in position to watch your retirement savings grow.This article is provided for educational purposes only, and cannot be relied upon as tax or investment advice.

Bitcoin Magazine,"Upside Down World: Spooks are Heroes, Heroes are Spooks","Mon, 21 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/upside-down-world-spooks-are-heroes-heroes-are-spooks,Distorted perceptions of reality have completely inverted the perception of who is acting in the best interests of Bitcoin versus acting in their own interests in a way that puts Bitcoin at risk. ,"      This space is suffering from a problem of inverted perceptions. What makes Bitcoin valuable in the first place is its decentralized nature. The fact that it is a distributed system, with no central point of control, no central point of influence, not even a central point of interface for its users. This is the source of its resiliency and reliability. Without this property, without the ability to simply download a piece of software and start interacting with it, there is really no value to be found. It’s fundamentally no different from a bank database at that point. No one can be guaranteed access when someone (the operator) wants to take it away, no core properties like the supply cap or inflation rate can be guaranteed when someone (the operator) can change them at a whim. Many people in this space cheer on the erosion of these properties at this point. They champion solutions like ETFs and other custodians as a pathway to pumping the price and increasing their own fiat denominated net worth. They attack those working towards and advocating for solutions that don’t compromise the core value propositions of Bitcoin, painting them as spooks “risking what makes Bitcoin valuable.”It is a complete inversion of reality. The Spooks are Heroes, and the Heroes are Spooks. Saylor is literally defending custodians as a superior path to adoption than self custody. He is comparing people building and selling tools for self custody to FUDsters and fear mongers, or “paranoid crypto anarchists.” Painting the people who are building the tools necessary to defend and maintain the core properties of Bitcoin that give it value in the first place. He totally ignores the dynamics that led to gold and its role as a sound money to melt away over time as governments interfered and manipulated it. They accomplished this because all of the gold was held by custodians, no one held it themselves. No one directly used it, everyone choosing to use paper substitutes disconnected from the precious metal itself instead. Bitcoin can very much suffer the same fate. Whether through paper bitcoin diluting market demand, or custodians outright gaining influence over the consensus process and outright changing rules to suit their own needs and wants. Bitcoin is a social consensus system, its nature is defined entirely by actors who participate in the system. The scale of those actors, their own individual nature(s), the vulnerability to government interference, how many of them make up the majority of economic activity (more being better, less being worse), all of these things factor heavily into how Bitcoin will evolve and exist as a system. Many people in this space are cheering on short term actions that compromise its resilience in the long term as a neutral and decentralized system for perceived short term benefits in the form of price appreciation and economic gains. Developers working diligently and with little gratitude to maintain those core properties that give it value are attacked as spooks and government agents, while corporate suits and actual spooks attacking those properties are cheered on as heroes. The world in this space is upside down. This article is a Take. Opinions expressed are entirely the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine."
Bitcoin Magazine,What The ECB Gets Wrong About Bitcoin ,"Mon, 21 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/what-the-ecb-gets-wrong-about-bitcoin-,"In a recent paper, researchers from the European Central Bank make a handful of claims about Bitcoin that lack context, nuance and/or evidence. I’m here to shed light on what they got wrong.","     Follow Frank on X.  Last week, Ulrich Bindseil and Jürgen Schaaf of the European Central Bank (ECB) published a paper entitled “The distributional consequences of Bitcoin” in which they made a host of dubious claims about Bitcoin.The notions that those who are late to investing in bitcoin are impoverished by those who were early to investing in it and that Bitcoin has failed as a payments technology are the authors’ central arguments.Bitcoin analyst Tuur Demeester sounded the alarm about the report on X.1/ This new paper is a true declaration of war: the ECB claims that early #bitcoin adopters steal economic value from latecomers. I strongly believe authorities will use this luddite argument to enact harsh taxes or bans. Check 🧵 for why: pic.twitter.com/qg31YenTSC— Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) October 19, 2024  As a former academic, I was appalled at how lazy the arguments in this paper were. Hence, I’ve taken the time to push back on some of them.The main premise of the paper is that if bitcoin’s price continues to rise, early bitcoin investors — the “early birds” (the authors’ term) — will gain wealth at the expense of the “latecomers.” While this is true if the early birds hold all of their coins to no end, the dynamic is no different with any other publicly-traded asset. The bigger point that the researchers miss, though, is that some of us are both “early birds” and “latecomers.” I first bought bitcoin in January 2018, and I also bought some last week. Did I impoverish myself in this scenario? No, I didn’t. Nor has anyone who has dollar-cost averaged into bitcoin over any period of time. Also, I bought some gold earlier this year. After doing so, I didn’t shake my fist at the sky yelling “Damn all of you who have front run me to gold over the last 5,000 years!” I simply made the purchase in efforts to preserve my wealth in a highly inflationary environment — one that the ECB itself is partially responsible for causing — and went about my day.One of the other primary arguments in the paper is that Bitcoin has failed as a payment technology. In making this claim, the authors fail to even mention the Lightning Network, a layer built on top of Bitcoin that enables fast, cheap bitcoin payments. In recent years, the Lightning Network has grown exponentially. From August 2021 to August 2023, the network grew by 1212% — which occurred mostly during a bitcoin bear market. Major players from the world of traditional payments are building on Lightning, as well. A prominent example of this is David Marcus, former President of PayPal, who is the current CEO of Lightspark, which is building enterprise-ready payments infrastructure via the Lightning Network. Beyond Lightning, Bitcoin is still quite young and will likely need to be more fully monetized (less volatile in fiat money terms) before people begin using it more frequently using it as money.Throughout the piece, the authors bring up how bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are the preferred currencies of criminals and bad actors worldwide. While there’s little evidence that proves this to be the case, as methodology of Chainanalysis — the blockchain analysis firm often employed to look into crypto and criminal activity — is questionable at best. Terrorist organizations like Hamas have stopped relying on crypto donations because of their traceability. With that said, TD Bank was just fined $3 billion for enabling money laundering, while Wells Fargo is currently in the crosshairs of regulators for doing the same. And data shows that criminals prefer cash above all else when committing crimes. Lastly, I made two purchases last week with bitcoin and I can assure you that neither were illegal. And I’m not the only one who recently made perfectly legal purchases with bitcoin.$900 million in non-crypto (fiat currency) money laundering vs $900,000 in crypto money laundering.Crypto is clearly not the problem. Criminals and bad actors are.It would be a historic mistake to crush an entire emerging industry based on incorrect data. https://t.co/TEFEdvGG0o— Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) January 23, 2024  The authors also make the claim Bitcoin is a threat to democracy because crypto PACs now donate to politicians. The presupposes that every other lobbying group out there isn’t a threat to democracy, which is laughable. What the authors also missed is that bitcoin is often a money of last resort for pro-democracy activists who’ve been debanked by authoritarian regimes. One of the first moves in the modern dictator’s playbook is to cut dissidents off from the traditional financial system. In these cases, pro-democracy activists have to rely on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Alexei Navalny, Vladimir Putin’s former opposition, popularized using cryptocurrencies for donations when the Putin regime limited its access to traditional financial rails.The authors also suggest that central banks can just tighten monetary policy to counteract the “bubble” forming in bitcoin’s price. The last two years have proven that this isn’t true, as rates are just about the highest they’ve been in over a decade and a half, yet bitcoin’s price is still on the verge of approaching an all-time high in US dollar terms. Plus, tightening from the US Federal Reserve, the central bank of the US, led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) as well as other banks in 2023, highlighting the fact that tightening makes the traditional financial system more fragile. This only makes a stronger case for people to store their wealth outside of the traditional system in an asset like bitcoin.Beyond these points, the tone of this paper from the ECB is paternalistic in that it suggests that all retail investors are incapable of learning more about how markets work and why Bitcoin is important.Toward the end of the report, Bindseil and Schaaf cite a source that claims that “unsophisticated investors are drawn into the market” as the bitcoin bubble grows, seemingly suggesting that everyone one of these retail investors only buys at the top and sells toward the bottom of a drawdown.I was once one of those unsophisticated retail investors, and while I first bought bitcoin near its 2017 top, I also bought it on dozens of other occasions, including when its price dipped to local lows in 2018 and 2020. I did so because in studying Bitcoin and learning what problems it solves I came to place more faith in it than I did in the traditional monetary and financial systems.There are many others like me, and I’d imagine that they too take offense to the ECB’s diminishing their intellectual capabilities and writing deeply biased reports that misrepresent what Bitcoin is and the reasons why people invest in and adopt it."
Bitcoin Magazine,A Kamala Presidency Could Be Just as Bullish for Bitcoin,"Mon, 21 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/kamala-presidency-bullish-for-bitcoin,A Trump victory almost certainly ensures only one outcome – that crypto securities continue to flourish unchecked.,"Yes, I know, you’re here to let the hate flow.    You’ve bought all the rhetoric. Donald Trump likes crypto. He is embracing DeFi. He has his own shoes, and coins. He’s going to fire Gary! Like Polymarket in October, you think Trump is boo-llish. Unfortunately, you’ve bought a lot of another kind of bull.To unpack this, we have to understand what the Crypto 4 Trump initiative really is – and that’s an alliance of largely public U.S.-based mining firms and exchanges that have come together to spend aggressively to end their mistreatment. They are tired of being sued and harassed, and otherwise chased out of America. As well, they have every reason to be. But alas, the industry Bitcoin is not. This was the same argument made to justify the Fork Wars, and let’s just say for summation, that this ended terribly. If U.S. miners are forced elsewhere, mining will continue elsewhere, and decentralizing the hashrate, as we saw in the case of China’s mining ban, is quite simply: Good For Bitcoin™.Sure, ASIC manufacturing may remain consolidated in a few international firms. Maybe it will take even longer to rebuild. But other countries will take advantage, and the Bitcoin network will carry on. Bitcoin may be our best opportunity to topple all of the current superpowers, and to empower the developing world. If that means leaving the U.S. behind, so be it.Now let’s address the donkey in the room. A Kamala presidency will mean more enforcement of U.S. securities laws, not a referendum that allows millions of alts to proliferate. A Trump victory almost certainly ensures only one outcome for our industry, and that is that the SEC gets defanged, and that means “coins beyond Bitcoin” will get a “level playing field.”By contrast, continued enforcement of the SEC’s securities laws on the industry will rightfully make clear the difference between Bitcoin, which was distributed via proof-of-work (the only known way to circumvent securities sales), and all of the many centralized variants. Simply put: It's ""crypto assets"" that require a regulatory framework to survive, not Bitcoin, which is sufficiently decentralized.Forcing the crypto industry’s builders to abide by these laws will doubtless benefit developers seeking to extend these capabilities to Bitcoin, the only major crypto with regulatory clarity. Are we actually going to argue that encouraging millions of developers to put their technology on Bitcoin (as opposed to Ethereum or Solana) would be a bad thing? If there is a coherent thread to Bitcoin maximalism, it’s the assertion that everything outside of Bitcoin is either 1) a scam or 2) can be built on top of its blockchain. A continued crackdown on crypto will push the market to more thoroughly investigate the second point.Undoubtedly, it would also boost Microstrategy's stock, MSTR, as it would remain one of the few widely accessible plays to get legitimate beta on Bitcoin.Sure, maybe the taxes from your Bitcoin gains will be higher, maybe spending will continue to be penalized. But anon, I thought you were HODLing anyway? So, remind me, of all the supposed pro-Bitcoin policies of a Trump presidency, what is it that you expect to get, other than state-sanctioned degeneracy and block propagation in the heartland?If you’re a single issue Bitcoin voter, shouldn’t that mean voting for an option that makes Bitcoin more decentralized, and less reliant on U.S. government policy?Allow me to reintroduce you to Madame President Harris, a bullish choice for Bitcoin.This article is a Take.

Crypto Slate,Bitcoin’s bullish momentum seeking ‘euphoric’ market shift – Glassnode,"Wed, 23 Oct 2024",https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoins-bullish-momentum-seeking-euphoric-market-shift-glassnode/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is showing the first signs of positive price momentum since June, as it attempts to convincingly break the $69,000 price zone and shift to a “euphoric bull market.” According to Glassnode’s latest “Week Onchain Newsletter,” the recent rally has seen Bitcoin’s spot price break through key technical and on-chain price levels, pushing many […]The postBitcoin’s bullish momentum seeking ‘euphoric’ market shift – Glassnodeappeared first onCryptoSlate.","Bitcoin (BTC) is showing the first signs of positive price momentum since June, as it attempts to convincingly break the $69,000 price zone and shift to a “euphoric bull market.” According to Glassnode’s latest “Week Onchain Newsletter,” the recent rally has seen Bitcoin’s spot price break through key technical and on-chain price levels, pushing many investor positions back into unrealized profits and providing a potential boost to market sentiment. The AVIV Ratio, a key on-chain metric assessing active investors’ unrealized gains and losses, remains constructive, suggesting that profitability has remained robust even as the market faced challenges. This ratio also hints at potential room for further growth as Bitcoin attempts to transition from an “enthusiastic bull market” regime into a “euphoric bull market,” which would be marked by a sustained break above its previous all-time high of $69,000. Reclaiming key indicators The recent price surge saw Bitcoin move past both the 200-day and 111-day moving averages (DMA), which are historically important markers for investors. Furthermore, the report highlighted that the 365-day simple moving average (SMA) has acted as critical support during macroeconomic events, reinforcing the market’s resilience as Bitcoin maintains its upward trend. According to Fibonacci retracement levels, Bitcoin has remained within an atypical trading range for several months, indicating a period of consolidation rather than the more typical dramatic highs or sell-offs. Glassnode noted that net capital inflows have accelerated, increasing by $21.8 billion over the last 30 days, pushing Bitcoin’s realized cap to a record $646 billion. Institutional back at ‘cash and carry’ strategies Bitcoin’s derivative markets are also showing strong growth, with open interest in both perpetual and fixed-term futures contracts reaching a new all-time high of $32.9 billion. The increasing presence of institutional investors is highlighted by the CME futures contracts, which recorded $11.3 billion in open interest. These products offer institutional players regulated derivative exposure, allowing them to participate in yield-generating strategies such as cash-and-carry trades. Despite this institutional activity, futures trading volumes remain somewhat subdued, signaling that the market has yet to experience a significant surge in overall trading activity. Nevertheless, with yields from cash and carry strategies now around 9.6%, nearly double the yield from short-term US Treasuries, institutional interest in Bitcoin is expected to rise further, particularly as the Federal Reserve signals potential rate cuts in the months ahead. Additionally, the ongoing inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and CME futures markets further suggest that institutional traders are increasingly adopting long-spot and short-futures strategies to capture yield. This could expand Bitcoin’s liquidity and strengthen its position as a key asset in both retail and institutional portfolios.

The bold forecast is part of Bernstein’s latest “Black Book,” titled “From Coin to Compute: The Bitcoin Investing Guide,” which explores Bitcoin’s evolving role in financial portfolios and the compute economy. The report highlights Bitcoin’s potential to move beyond speculative trading, presenting a strong case for long-term investment opportunities driven by its increasing adoption among institutional investors. Bernstein “Black Books” are comprehensive and in-depth research reports produced by the global investment management and research firm Bernstein Research. These reports are often regarded as authoritative analyses of specific industries, companies, or financial assets, providing detailed insights, forecasts, and strategic advice. Institutional adoption One of the key insights in the report is the increasing adoption of Bitcoin among institutional investors, who are managing the asset’s liquidity and volatility risks. The report compares Bitcoin’s liquidity profile to that of traditional assets like equities and commodities, showing that while BTC carries higher liquidity risks due to its shorter liquidity duration, institutional investors are still incorporating it into their portfolios. According to Bernstein, this reflects Bitcoin’s appeal as a long-term hedge against inflation and macroeconomic instability. The report further suggests that institutional investors are not deterred by the high volatility of Bitcoin; instead, they are deploying advanced risk management strategies to mitigate potential drawdowns, including adjusting portfolio allocations and liquidity buffers to accommodate Bitcoin’s market behavior. The Compute Economy Bernstein’s analysis also shifts focus toward Bitcoin’s future role in what it calls the “compute economy.” The report suggests that Bitcoin is moving beyond its traditional function as a store of value and is becoming an essential part of the global computational landscape. This involves leveraging Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain infrastructure for computational tasks, which could fuel advancements in technology and data processing. According to Bernstein, global Bitcoin miners are already scaling up their computational capabilities, with mining pools expanding across various regions. The report identifies this growing computational power as a key factor in Bitcoin’s anticipated price appreciation. By harnessing blockchain technology for tasks beyond crypto transactions, Bitcoin could unlock new avenues of technological growth. Regulatory challenges Despite regulatory ambiguity, particularly in the US, Bernstein’s report suggests that regulatory clarity could provide a significant boost to Bitcoin’s institutional adoption. The report highlighted the ongoing scrutiny from regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) but suggested that once clear frameworks are established, institutions will have more confidence in increasing their exposure to Bitcoin. This regulatory clarity would enable institutions to manage compliance risks more effectively while expanding their Bitcoin holdings. Bernstein’s analysis concludes that a clearer regulatory environment could be a catalyst for Bitcoin reaching the projected $200,000 price target.

On Oct. 21, data from Blockchain.com revealed that Bitcoin’s seven-day hash rate reached an all-time peak of nearly 703 exahashes per second (EH/s), marking the first instance where the network surpassed 700 EH/s. Bitcoin Hash rate (Source: Blockchain.Com) The hash rate measures the computational power dedicated to solving complex mathematical challenges. These efforts are crucial for validating transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain. In the past year, the hash rate has consistently increased despite the Bitcoin halving event, which cut miners’ block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This halving reduced daily Bitcoin production from 900 BTC to 450 BTC This significant milestone occurred just a day before the network’s mining difficulty increased by around 4% to 95.67 trillion on Oct. 22. Bitcoin Difficulty (Source: CryptoQuant) Bitcoin’s mining difficulty adjusts every two weeks after 2,016 blocks are mined. This mechanism is designed to maintain consistent block discovery times. When difficulty rises, miners must use more computational power to successfully mine each block. An increase in difficulty typically indicates more miners are participating in the network, which raises the overall workload. Higher difficulty also enhances blockchain security, requiring more energy to mount attacks on the network. Hashrate Index said Bitcoin’s mining difficulty is expected to reach 100 trillion by the end of the year, in line with a seven-day hash rate of over 700 EH/s.

Bitcoin Magazine,If Microsoft Invests in Bitcoin It Will Be Likely Via Spot ETFs,"Fri, 25 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/if-microsoft-invests-in-bitcoin-it-will-be-likely-via-spot-etfs,Microsoft's management may choose to invest in Bitcoin ETFs over holding their own coins.,"     Follow Nikolaus On X Here  At the tail end of yesterday, MacroScope, a financial analyst focusing on Bitcoin, revealed a new SEC filing stating that Microsoft is voting this December on whether it should invest in bitcoin.At first I thought there is no way this happens right now, and figured it will just be a short lived hype, especially after noticing a detail in the filing stating that Microsoft’s board recommends its shareholders to vote AGAINST the proposal of “Assessment of Investment in Bitcoin”.But then Macroscope came with another update that revealed something promising. Microsoft is urging its shareholders to vote against the proposal because their management “already carefully considers this topic.” If Microsoft were to follow in the footsteps of MicroStrategy (a wild thing to even type out and say to myself) it would mark an historic milestone for Bitcoin: Microsoft is the third largest company in the world by market capitalization at $3.208 trillion.Will this actually happen? It’s anyone's guess at the moment. But Michael Saylor has himself reached out to Microsoft’s Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella to discuss the possibility. If there’s one man who can speak Nadella’s language and get the job done, it’s Saylor. And there are plenty of reasons why Microsoft should invest in bitcoin… like having $75 billion in cash on hand that is just melting away like an ice cube.Having said that, just because Saylor understands the importance of holding actual BTC on their balance sheet, he also knows that other large corporations interested in investing in Bitcoin might prefer a different method of exposure (like purchasing shares of spot Bitcoin ETFs). So if Microsoft were to invest into Bitcoin, I think they will likely just buy shares of BlackRock and others Bitcoin ETFs. (I would love to be wrong though, and have them actually buy the BTC and hold it themselves on their balance sheet.)In any case, one thing for certain after reading all this: Bitcoin is now too large to ignore, even for the biggest companies in the world.This article is a Take.

I found this tribute incredibly inspiring and beautiful.The statue was revealed at Lugano's Plan B conference, turning heads with its clever invisible design. Viewed head-on, it disappears entirely - representing Satoshi's own anonymity. This is an artistic masterpiece perfectly encapsulating his mystery.Of course, some bitcoiners like Mandrik found it underwhelming. But art is subjective. To me, this statue brilliantly captures Satoshi's ephemeral essence using visionary sculpture techniques. And Lugano was the perfect setting as a leading Bitcoin hub with over 100 merchants accepting Lightning payments.After visiting Lugano last month and living the Bitcoin life using Lightning while there, I'm ecstatic to return now that it houses this iconic Satoshi monument.      This is only the second Satoshi statue globally after Budapest's impressive effort. We need more inspiring Satoshi tributes to spread his peaceful ideals worldwide.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Lightspark Announces New Bitcoin L2 and Upgraded UMA Capabilities,"Fri, 25 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/lightspark-announces-new-bitcoin-l2-and-upgraded-uma-capabilities,"Lightspark unveils a new Bitcoin L2 and broadens the functionality of its Universal Money Address (UMA) standard with the release of UMA Extend, UMA Auth and UMA Request.","At Lightspark Sync, Lightspark’s first partner summit on Thursday, the company announced new products and features that will allow users to make global payments with both bitcoin and fiat.The company announced that it has launched an alpha version of Spark, a Bitcoin Layer 2 that’s interoperable with Lightning and that makes it cheaper to onboard users to a non-custodial Bitcoin layer.The company also announced new capabilities for UMA, the company’s open-source and regulatory compliant payment solution that makes sending money as simple as sending an email.With UMA Extend, the Lightning Network can serve as a bridge between traditional banks globally, while with UMA Auth and UMA Request, UMA users can tip, pay subscription fees and make payments to merchants within apps.  Lightspark CEO David Marcus speaking at Lightspark Sync.  Spark — Lightspark’s Bitcoin Layer 2Spark is a Layer 2 protocol for Bitcoin that leverages statechain technology. In short, users can hold fractions of bitcoin off-chain, and transfer these by sending private keys to other users (rather than signing transactions with the keys).Lightspark created Spark to better support the onboarding of users to the Lightning Network, which normally requires an on-chain transaction for each payment channel as well as the locking up of some amount of bitcoin in these channels so users can send and receive transactions.The layer 2 was primarily borne from the frustration that the Lightspark team encountered in trying to create a non-custodial Lightning wallet for users.“Self-custodial Lightning wallets, especially at scale, just aren’t viable,” Lightspark CTO Kevin Hurley told Bitcoin Magazine. “If you are opening channels for billions of users, fees are going to go through the roof, and you're going to fill up block space. It's just something that's not going to be reasonable and you lock up liquidity for every single user,” he added.Hurley also shared that Lightspark didn’t want to wait for the enabling of Bitcoin opcodes (like CheckTemplateVerify or TapleafUpdateVerify) that would make it cheaper to open new Lightning channels. Lightspark wanted to offer users a non-custodial option immediately.So, they built Spark, a Bitcoin Layer 2 that offers users cheap, instant payments as well as a permissionless, unilateral exit to the Bitcoin base layer. It also enables offline receive, or the ability to receive bitcoin even when your device isn’t connected to the internet.Besides statechains, Spark also utilizes atomic swap technology. Its design is similar to that of Mercury Layer in that it enables the off-chain transfer of ownership of Bitcoin UTXOs while benefiting from near instant and fee-free transactions, according to Hurley.“Mercury has a lot of core limitations that we go beyond,” explained Hurley. “In Mercury, for example, you can transfer whole UTXOs only. You have absolute time bombs where you have to go back on chain at some absolute time. So, you can only do so many transactions. Also, we pull in different pieces like connector transactions from Ark, for example, but, other than that, we're not similar to Ark at all,” he explained. “I think it's hard to compare it to something, because it pulls in a lot of different components, and I think the trade-offs that we chose to make are different than many others probably chose to make.”Besides bitcoin, it’s also possible to issue and use stablecoins on Spark. Or you can issue stablecoins via Taproot assets, LRC-20 or RGB on the base layer and transfer them to Spark.A unique dimension of Spark, though, is that the assets on the layer 2 are all UMA enabled.“You can now have non-custodial users sending directly to the bank accounts of UMA Extend users,” said Hurley, mentioning one of the new functionalities of UMA addresses.  Lightspark CTO Kevin Hurley speaking at Lightspark Sync.  UMA ExtendUMA Extend integrates the Lightning Network with traditional banking systems, allowing users to make international bank transfers in seconds. With this new technology, UMA Extend users can send any other UMA Extend user a near instant cross-border payment from one bank to another over Lightning as easily as sending an email.“It’s designed to facilitate money movement across any currency,” Nicolas Cabrera, VP of Product at Lightspark, told Bitcoin Magazine. “I can be in Brazil sending my local currency, the Brazilian real, to a user based in Europe that wants to receive euros or someone in the US who wants to receive USD.”The Brazilian reals leave the sender’s bank account, are converted into sats by the bank (or an entity like Zero Hash, if the banks can’t touch crypto), which are then received by the recipient’s bank, which converts it back into euros, USD of whatever currency the recipient holds in their bank account. All of this occurs within 30 seconds or so, a radical shift compared to the two to three days it often takes for international money transfers to settle.“This is the first time connecting the Lightning Network to traditional banking routes and bank systems,” Cabrera added.UMA Extend utilizes Real-Time Payments (RTP), which enables real-time payments for federally insured depository institutions in the United States, and comparable services in the other countries in which UMA Extend is available. All banks in the US who use RTP support Extend. Currently, Lightspark’s partners support on- and off-ramps for 44 fiat currencies in over 100 countries.The traditional financial institutions involved with these transactions will set the fees for the transactions, which tend to range between 0.25% and 0.5% — significantly cheaper than the 6.35% customers often pay to make international remittance payments via traditional financial rails.Those interested in using UMA Extend can do so via this link.UMA AuthAt the event, Lightspark also introduced UMA Auth. The technology leverages OAuth (Open Authentication) technology (the backend tech for when a website gives you the option to sign into a third-party app or website with Google or Facebook), an open-standard authorization protocol that provides users with secure access to a website or application.UMA Auth was built using Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC), a protocol developed by the team at Alby. NWC now supports UMA features like cross-currency transactions and client app registration.“We wanted to expand the coverage of UMA beyond wallets to applications,” Shreya Vissamsetti, a member of the Lightspark engineering team that works on UMA, told Bitcoin Magazine.“UMA Auth is a new extension on top of UMA that allows you to integrate payments directly into an application. The idea is that it's a lot like OAuth, but for money,” she added. “All you have to do is input your UMA address and then we form a connection to your Lightspark wallet straight from the application. That gives the app access to communicate with your wallet and push money in right from the application.”UMA Auth enables users to do everything from tipping their favorite artists to paying a subscription fee to paying a friend through their preferred messaging app.“Say I'm listening to Taylor Swift,” began Vissamsetti.“I can link my UMA account, and if my favorite song is playing, I can just tap a button and send her a super small tip,” she explained.“Tipping is one of the main uses we’re going after with this product,” said Cabrera. “Lightning is again a good foundation layer for us because it allows for sending small amounts.”UMA RequestUMA Request is another new dimension of UMA, one that allows any UMA user to request a payment from another UMA user.Merchants can use UMA Request to request payments via an invoice, which comes in the form of a QR code, for the product sold or service rendered. UMA Request also supports zero-sum invoices, through which invoice recipients can pay whatever amount they’d like.“Previously with UMA, the sender initiated the payment, but we’ve flipped it around,” said Vissamsetti.Another standout feature of UMA Request is that it ensures both parties involved in the transaction receive a record of the transaction.UMA Request makes purchasing items online — especially across borders — easier and cheaper than using credit cards.Moving ForwardLightspark’s CEO David Marcus, the former president of PayPal, believes that it’s only a matter of time until more banks and platforms come to adapt new technologies like UMA Extend, UMA Auth and UMA Request.“At the end of the day, if you build a more efficient network that enables global money movements to move faster, cheaper, in real time 24/7 with no blackout dates, then that's where money is going to flow and the financial system and the ecosystem players are just going to need to adapt to that,” Marcus told Bitcoin Magazine.Regarding Spark, the Lightspark team is looking for feedback from users on how to improve the product.“We are going to fully engage with the community,” said Hurley. “We want to make this completely out in the open, completely open-source. Anyone can audit it, spin up their own versions if they want to,” he added.“We want this to be a collaborative thing where the community joins in, where they hopefully submit pull requests and help find things that they want to improve.”Christina Smedley, co-founder and Chief Marketing and Comms Officer at Lightspark, echoed Hurley’s sentiment as she discussed both Spark and UMA’s new functionalities.“We’re trying to [onboard] the next billion or couple of billion,” Smedley told Bitcoin Magazine, “so it’s really important that what we do is open-source and community-led.”"
Bitcoin Magazine,Is Bitcoin Repeating Previous Bull Cycles?,"Fri, 25 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/is-bitcoin-repeating-previous-bull-cycles-,"Are we repeating the same patterns we are all accustomed to, or is this time something different?","Bitcoin’s price cycles have long been a source of intrigue for investors and analysts alike. We can gain insights into potential price movements by comparing current trends to previous cycles, especially with Bitcoin seemingly coming to an end of its consolidation period, many wonder if the next leg up is around the corner.Comparing Bitcoin CyclesTo begin, it’s crucial to look at how Bitcoin has performed since hitting its recent cycle low. As we examine the data, a clear picture begins to form: Bitcoin's current price action (black line) is showing patterns similar to previous bull cycles. Although it has been a choppy consolidation period, where the price has been relatively stagnant, there are key similarities when we compare this cycle to those in 2015-2018 (purple line) and 2018-2022 (blue line).  Figure 1: BTC Growth Since Cycle Lows showing similarities with our previous two cycles. View Live Chart 🔍  Where we are today, in terms of percentage gains, is comparable to both the 2018 and 2015 cycles. However, this comparison only scratches the surface. Price action alone doesn't tell the full story, so we need to dive deeper into investor behavior and other metrics that shape the Bitcoin market.Investor BehaviorOne key metric that gives us insight into investor behavior is the MVRV Z-Score. This ratio compares Bitcoin's current market price to its ""realized price"" (or cost basis), which represents the average price at which all Bitcoin on the network was accumulated. The Z-Score then just standardizes the raw MVRV data for BTC volatility to exclude extreme outliers.  Figure 2: Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score gives insights into profits and losses for the average investor. View Live Chart 🔍  Analyzing metrics such as this one, as opposed to purely focusing on price actions, will allow us to see patterns and similarities in our current cycle to previous ones, not just in dollar movements but also in investor habits and sentiment.Correlating MovementsTo better understand how the current cycle aligns with previous ones, we turn to the data from Bitcoin Magazine Pro, which offers in-depth insights through its API. Excluding our Genesis cycle, as there is little correlation and isolating the price and MVRV data from Bitcoin's lowest closing prices to its highest points in our current and previous three cycles, we can see clear correlations.  Figure 3: Price and MVRV correlations between this cycle and our previous three.  2011 to 2013 Cycle: This cycle, characterized by its double peak, shows a strong 87% correlation with the current price action. The MVRV ratio also shows a high 82% correlation, meaning that not only is Bitcoin’s price behaving similarly, but so is investor behavior in terms of buying and selling.2015 to 2017 Cycle: This cycle is actually the closest in terms of price action, boasting an 89% correlation with our current cycle. However, the MVRV ratio is slightly lower, suggesting that while prices are following similar paths, investor behavior might be slightly different.2018 to 2021 Cycle: This most recent cycle, while positive, has the lowest correlation to current trends, indicating that the market may not be following the same patterns it did just a few years ago.Are We in for Another Double Peak?The strong correlation with the 2011-2013 cycle is particularly noteworthy. During that period, Bitcoin experienced a double peak, where the price surged to new all-time highs twice before entering a prolonged bear market. If Bitcoin follows this pattern, we could be on the verge of significant price movements in the coming weeks. After overlaying the price action fractal from this period over our current cycle and standardizing the returns, the similarities are instantly noticeable.  Figure 4: Overlaying a standardized fractal of the 2013 double peak cycle on our current price action.  In both cases, Bitcoin had a rapid run-up to a new high, followed by a long, choppy period of consolidation. If history repeats itself, we could see a massive price rally soon, potentially to around $140,000 before the end of the year when accounting for diminishing returns.Patterns In Investor BehaviorAnother valuable metric to examine is the Value Days Destroyed (VDD). This metric weights BTC movements by the amount being moved and the time since it was last transferred and multiplies this value by the price to offer insights into long-term investors’ behavior, specifically profit-taking.  Figure 5: VDD initial run-up and cool-off confirm similarities in investor behavior. View Live Chart 🔍  In the current cycle, VDD has shown an initial spike similar to the red spikes we saw during the 2013 double peak. This run-up as BTC ran to a new all-time high earlier this year before a sustained consolidation period could see us reaching new highs soon again if this double peak cycle pattern continues.A More Realistic ScenarioAs Bitcoin has grown and matured as an asset, we’ve seen extended cycles and diminishing returns in our two most recent cycles compared to our initial two. Therefore, it’s probably more likely that BTC follows the cycle in which we’re seeing the strongest correlation in price action.   Figure 6: Overlaying a fractal of the 2017 cycle on our current price action.If Bitcoin follows the 2015-2017 pattern, we could still see new all-time highs before the end of 2024, but the rally would likely be slower and more sustainable. This scenario predicts a price target of around $90,000 to $100,000 by early 2025. After that, we could see continuous growth throughout the year, with a potential market peak in late 2025, although a peak of $1.2 million if we follow this pattern exactly may be optimistic!ConclusionHistorical data suggests we’re approaching a critical turning point. Whether we follow the explosive double-peak cycle from 2011-2013 or the slower but steady rise of 2015-2017, the outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish. Monitoring key metrics like the MVRV ratio and Value Days Destroyed will provide further clues as to where the market is headed, and comparing correlations with our previous cycles will give us better insights into what may be coming.With Bitcoin poised for a breakout, whether in the next few weeks or in 2025, if BTC even remotely follows the patterns of any of our previous cycles, investors should prepare for significant price action and potential new all-time highs sooner rather than later.For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out a recent YouTube video here: Comparing Bitcoin Bull Runs: Which Cycle Are We Following"
Bitcoin Magazine,BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF is the Most Successful New ETF in 4 Years,"Thu, 24 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/blackrocks-ibit-bitcoin-etf-is-the-most-successful-new-etf-in-4-years,Institutional investment in Bitcoin is here and it is just getting started.,"     Follow Nikolaus On X Here  Ever since BlackRock filed for its spot Bitcoin ETF last year, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have been providing valuable insights and data regarding everything Bitcoin ETFs. If you’re not already following either of them on X, I highly recommend you do.Today, Balchunas shared a new mind blowing statistic about BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT specifically. Over the last four years, there were over 1,800 ETFs launched in the United States. Out of all of those, IBIT has taken in the most inflows at over $26 billion dollars.     BlackRock had another giant inflow of $323 million yesterday, massively outperforming all its competitors. I’m not sure if it’s just their brand name alone that's able to out compete the other ETFs, or if they’re marketing IBIT to their customers behind the scenes that is making their ETF a standout success. Probably a bit of both and then some.These numbers once again highlight that spot Bitcoin ETFs have been a smashing success in America. Since launch, these ETFs have together seen inflows in 9 out of the last 10 months, and I feel like these inflows are not going to stop anytime soon, especially as we head further into the bull market. While I would much rather see investors who hold their own keys, I understand that might not be suitable for large corporations and small retail investors who don’t want the responsibilities that come with self custody. Whether you like it or not, the institutions are here and they are driving up the price of Bitcoin (for now). I’m super interested to see how these ETFs will hold up in a bear market, and if they will HODL or if we will see record outflows. Only time will tell.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,The ECB Economists Aren't Exactly Wrong About Bitcoin (They’re Just Useless),"Thu, 24 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/the-ecb-economists-are-not-exactly-wrong-about-bitcoin-theyre-just-useless-,A recent paper from the ECB in which the authors claim the existence of Bitcoin could impoverish non-holders and latecomers drew the ire from many bitcoiners... but isn’t this essentially what hyperbitcoinization is?,"     Follow Aaron on Nostr or X.  Earlier this month, the European Central Bank (ECB) published a paper in which the authors claim the existence of Bitcoin could impoverish non-holders and latecomers.Specifically, they wrote:“Since Bitcoin does not increase the productive potential of the economy, the consequences of the assumed continued increase in value are essentially redistributive, i.e. the wealth effects on consumption of early Bitcoin holders can only come at the expense of consumption of the rest of society.”It drew the ire from many bitcoiners, including Frank in his Take… but isn’t this essentially what hyperbitcoinization is? If bitcoin becomes the money of the world, HODLers become the new wealthy elite while the fiat bag holders would effectively go broke, right?The real crux, I think, lies in the first part of the quote. Many bitcoiners, including myself, believe that Bitcoin in fact would increase the productive potential of the economy. (There are several reasons for this, but a big one is that it gets rid of fiat currency’s Cantillon effect, which largely benefits governments.)If it had been possible in 2009 to swap all fiat currency in the world for bitcoin so everyone received a representative share (thus no redistributive effects), that may arguably have been preferable… but the ECB economists would still be against it: they just don’t see the benefit of bitcoin in the first place.Since Satoshi Nakamoto had no way to swap everyone’s fiat for bitcoin even if he wanted to, it makes sense that he launched the project the way he did, allowing anyone to adopt this superior money whenever that fits their individual risk-appetite.If the ECB economists believe there is a better way to distribute this new form of money, I'd suggest they use their Cantillon-funded salaries to write a paper about that.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Does Jack Dorsey Influence Bitcoin? ,"Thu, 24 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/does-jack-dorsey-influence-bitcoin-,I just learned Jack Dorsey provides over 60% of Bitcoin Core's funding - I think we need to decentralize their support. ,"     Follow Vivek on X.  I recently stumbled upon a fantastic report from 1A1z on ""Funding Bitcoin."" I was surprised to learn that Jack Dorsey funds over 60% of Bitcoin Core's development via different organizations: over $5 million annually, out of a total of only $8.4 million in funding. Wild, right? For a $1.2 trillion asset, I expected way more diverse support.Now, you might be worried that that concentration risks him having too much sway. If he turned against Core's principles, his funding leverage could be a real concern.But does Dorsey's power really extend to controlling Bitcoin itself? Nope, no way. Bitcoin's decentralisation means no single entity can dictate terms, not even the chief donor of the main Bitcoin implementation.Here's the key difference: Bitcoin Core versus the Bitcoin network. Core adds useful features, but people choose what nodes to run. If Core went rogue, people would just reject its changes or use different software.So Dorsey can't force changes to Bitcoin. His influence has hard limits, even if he decides to dictate to developers what to work on or what to push. Nodes hold the real power over Bitcoin's evolution. (You can read more about Bitcoin Core's governance here: Who Controls Bitcoin Core? by Jameson Lopp.)Still, I think there should be more donors and organisations funding Bitcoin Core or other implementations. Many crypto companies benefit and earn millions in monthly profits, depending on Bitcoin's success, but surprisingly, they don't contribute anything. Ideally, people should also fund different implementations of Bitcoin in addition to Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin will only thrive through decentralization. We've got to apply that ethos to funding Core, too. Dorsey's funding concentration challenges it, while spreading the donor base protects Bitcoin's antifragility.This article is a Take.

Crypto Slate,Retail investors dominate demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs – Binance Research,"Fri, 25 Oct 2024",https://cryptoslate.com/retail-investors-dominate-demand-for-spot-bitcoin-etfs-binance-research/,"Retail investors are leading the charge in the adoption of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), accounting for 80% of the total demand, according to a Binance Research report.

According to the report, Bitcoin ETFs have seen accelerated adoption since their debut, with cumulative holdings now reaching over 938,700 BTC — approximately $63.3 billion in assets under management (AUM) — representing 5.2% of Bitcoin’s total supply, according to a recent report by Binance Research. The report highlights that net inflows for these ETFs have consistently outpaced initial projections, demonstrating strong investor demand that has led to a market reshaping of both price conditions and institutional interest. Steady demand The report noted that spot Bitcoin ETFs are driving a steady demand by absorbing about 1,100 BTC per day from circulation. In contrast to gold ETFs, Bitcoin ETFs gathered over $20 billion in net inflows within the first ten months of trading, overshadowing the $1.5 billion gold ETFs accumulated in their debut year. Additionally, institutional buy-in has surged, with over 1,200 institutions participating, up from the modest 95 institutions that joined in the first year of gold ETFs. Despite this institutional growth, retail investors remain the core of the market, comprising roughly 80% of ETF holdings, underscoring Bitcoin’s popularity among non-institutional investors. The report noted that many of these retail investors are not entirely new to crypto but are moving their holdings from digital wallets and exchanges to ETFs, seeking the added regulatory protection and ease offered by these funds. This shift emphasizes the unique role spot Bitcoin ETFs are playing by offering a simplified, accessible entry point for individual investors while maintaining robust demand. Despite this dominance of retail buyers, institutional interest has also grown substantially, with over 1,200 institutions investing in spot BTC ETFs in less than a year. This adoption pace far exceeds that of early gold ETFs, which saw just 95 institutional investors within their first year. However, retail buyers continue to set the pace for demand, with holdings rising by 30% since the first quarter, driven largely by self-directed investors using online brokerage accounts. Market stability and liquidity A defining feature of these ETFs is their broader impact on market stability and liquidity. Since the launch of spot ETFs, Bitcoin’s spot trading volume has risen significantly, averaging a daily trading volume increase of 66.9% year-over-year. Market depth, a measure of Bitcoin’s liquidity, has improved as institutional participants and market makers inject additional capital, leading to tighter spreads and reduced price volatility. This evolving liquidity profile has drawn more traditional investors, with some firms even using Bitcoin as collateral in structured lending, a practice previously reserved for more conventional assets. The report also detailed a shift in sentiment as Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional finance indicators, such as the S&P 500, reaches historic highs. This trend is seen as a reflection of Bitcoin’s dual role as both a growth asset and a hedge against macroeconomic volatility. According to Binance Research, ETF flows have mirrored broader market sentiment shifts, reinforcing the flagship crypto’s integration into traditional finance.

The whale may be preparing to profit from the mining rewards, which at the time were worth $1.5. A sale would reward the miner with a profit of 226,666,567%. Bitcoin analysis of whale activity (Source: Arkham Intelligence) As of press time, the Bitccoin mined in 2010 has not moved from its new location. However, analysis of associated wallets indicates the miner is still very active in the crypto industry, meaning this whale has held onto 50 BTC from the early days of Bitcoin while actively participating in the industry. CryptoSlate analysis revealed that the wallet did not exhibit features aligning with the Patoshi pattern, indicating the miner was unlikely to have been Satoshi himself. The block was mined in July 2010 when there were many other miners on the network other than Satoshi himself. While additional information was included in the Coinbase transaction, the nonce values were inconsistent with Patoshi’s.

Dennis Porter, CEO and co-founder of […]The postSatoshi Action Fund seeks to replicate cannabis industry with ‘safe haven’ states for Bitcoin custodyappeared first onCryptoSlate.","The Satoshi Action Fund is advancing efforts to secure state-level protections for Bitcoin self-custody, employing strategies similar to those used by the cannabis industry to navigate federal regulations. This initiative aims to create “safe haven” states for Bitcoin users, providing legal assurances for holding and using the digital asset. Dennis Porter, CEO and co-founder of the Satoshi Action Fund argues that state law holds precedence in the absence of federal law. Porter stated,  “If federal law contradicts state law, the federal government is required to enforce it and cannot require state or local law enforcement to assist them.”  He highlighted the cannabis industry’s success in thriving despite federal prohibition, attributing it to states passing laws that protect cannabis use and possession, which the federal government has been reluctant to counter aggressively. Per Porter’s comments, the Satoshi Action Fund seeks to preempt federal action by establishing state laws safeguarding Bitcoin rights. He said,  “We are creating safe haven states for Bitcoin today instead of waiting for the federal government to act,”  Porter emphasized that waiting delayed the cannabis industry’s progress by decades, a setback he aims to avoid for Bitcoin. This state-level strategy, Porter argues, has historical precedent in movements such as women’s suffrage, civil rights, and same-sex marriage. According to Porter, these movements gained momentum at the state level before culminating in federal legislation. “Studies back up the claim that when there is a flurry of activity at the state level, the federal government reacts and passes the same or similar legislation,” he noted. However, some legal experts caution about the limitations of state laws in the face of federal authority. Attorney Joe Carlasare pointed out that federal law is supreme over state law in most cases. “It doesn’t matter what laws a state passes if the Feds decide to preempt it,” Carlasare commented. He acknowledged, though, that he believes the federal government cannot lawfully ban the self-custody of Bitcoin. Further, in response to Porter, Carlasare continued, “No State passed a law (again, still just a bill) yesterday Dennis! An election year stunt was successfully performed and you claimed, for sensationalist reasons that it would ‘shift the election.'” Carlasare argues, “The cannabis comparison is weak. Possession is still illegal under Federal law, but Feds rarely prosecute basic possession (they haven’t for years). That is why cannabis “thrives” — not because of state laws. The Feds concentrate prosecute on large trafficking of it.” Progress toward state-level protection for Bitcoin Amid these discussions, Pennsylvania has taken a significant step by passing House Bill 2481, also known as the “Bitcoin Rights” bill. The bipartisan legislation, which passed the House of Representatives with a 176-26 vote, aims to protect residents’ rights to self-custody digital assets and establishes guidelines for taxing digital asset transactions. As reported previously, the bill now moves to the Republican-controlled Senate and, if enacted, would position Pennsylvania among states proactively addressing crypto regulation without clear federal guidelines. The bill’s passage reflects growing advocacy for state-level crypto protections, supported by groups focused on integrating Bitcoin into mainstream financial systems. Pennsylvania, a critical swing state with an estimated 1.5 million crypto owners, has become a focal point for these efforts. The Satoshi Action Fund hopes the state’s actions will influence other states to adopt similar measures, especially as federal agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission continue to deliberate over digital asset regulation. While challenges remain due to the supremacy of federal law, the momentum at the state level signifies a concerted effort to establish legal protections for Bitcoin users. The outcome of these initiatives may shape the future landscape of Bitcoin regulation across the United States.

On Oct. 24, BitcoinOS explained that the move would expand Bitcoin’s reach and enable decentralized programmability on its network. The integration makes Cardano the first Layer 1 blockchain to use BitcoinOS infrastructure, tapping into Bitcoin’s vast $1.3 trillion liquidity pool. BitcoinOS has already announced integrations with several other Bitcoin Layer-2 chains, including Merlin and Sovyrn. The partnership aims to address a critical gap in the Bitcoin network by introducing the needed infrastructure for DeFi activities. Although Bitcoin leads in value, most crypto activities occur outside its ecosystem. With this in mind, BitcoinOS has designed the integration to bridge Bitcoin with the rest of the crypto world, fostering a unified digital landscape that maximizes value. Grail Bridge BitcoinOS explained that its Grail Bridge uses zero-knowledge cryptography to let Bitcoin users move their assets securely. The partnership empowers Cardano to leverage the Grail Bridge to boost liquidity, facilitating trustless transfers of BTC and other Bitcoin-based assets. Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, stated that BitcoinOS operates not as a simple bridge but as a “brain” guiding Bitcoin’s integration into the broader crypto ecosystem. He added: “[BitcoinOS] is going to let Bitcoin flow into the crypto world, and they finally get to ditch their boring lives and enjoy DeFi, GameFi, and the magic of Smart Contracts.” Hoskinson also highlighted an additional benefit of the integration, noting that it allows users to pay fees directly in Bitcoin, creating mutual advantages for users. He stated: “Whether your bitcoin stay at home or go visit other chains, it doesn’t impact the bitcoin network. With BOS, they can now go interact with other ledgers.

Kraken to Launch “Ink” Blockchain on Optimism Superchain in 2025, Aims to Streamline DeFi In early 2025, Kraken, a major cryptocurrency exchange based in the United States, intends to introduce its blockchain, Ink. The Optimism Superchain will serve as the foundation for the layer-2 (L2) network Ink, which is intended for decentralized uses such as lending, borrowing, and trading.  By the end of 2024, a testnet for Ink will be made available so developers can investigate its functionalities. Ink will not receive a token from Kraken, unlike other blockchains. By removing obstacles between centralized and decentralized finance, the exchange seeks to streamline the DeFi experience.

This gain occurred despite MicroStrategy engaging in significantly less business activity than Microsoft. “And they’re not alone. The institutional and corporate adoption of Bitcoin is becoming more commonplace,” it added. “Microsoft’s second largest shareholder, BlackRock, offers its clients a Bitcoin ETF.” The think tank suggested companies consider investing at least 1% of assets in Bitcoin. Earlier this year, Microsoft invested $1.5b in UAE-based AI company G42 to expand its AI presence.

Crypto News,"Pennsylvania Embraces Bitcoin, New Bill Protects Self-Custody and Payments","Thu, 24 Oct 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/pennsylvania-embraces-bitcoin-new-bill-protects-self-custody-and-payments/,"Pennsylvania has passed the bipartisan Bitcoin Rights Bill, allowing residents to self-custody digital assets and use Bitcoin for payments, marking a significant step toward regulatory clarity in the state's cryptocurrency landscape.The postPennsylvania Embraces Bitcoin, New Bill Protects Self-Custody and Paymentsappeared first onCryptonews."," Pennsylvania is stepping into the future of cryptocurrency by passing a bipartisan bill that would clarify the state’s stance on digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. The legislation, known as House Bill 2481 or the “Bitcoin Rights Bill,” protects residents’ rights to self-custody their digital assets and outlines guidelines for using Bitcoin as a payment method and taxing Bitcoin transactions.  Pennsylvania Advances Bitcoin Rights Bill Amid Growing Crypto Movement According to a report by Fox Business, the bill was overwhelmingly approved by the Pennsylvania House, with 176 votes in favor and only 26 against, showcasing strong support from both Democrats and Republicans. House Bill 2481 ensures residents can manage their Bitcoin without third-party interference and establishes a legal framework for Bitcoin transactions within the state.   #BREAKING: The state of Pennsylvania has passed ‘Bitcoin Rights’ in the House by a sweeping majority. Both Republicans and Democrats united together to pass the bill.#Bitcoin #BTC pic.twitter.com/adrea4tmcy— General Strike (Terrence Daniels) (@Terrence_STR) October 24, 2024  The legislation is part of a broader trend among states seeking to define their own regulatory approaches to the burgeoning $2 trillion digital asset market, especially amid ongoing confusion at the federal level regarding which agency should oversee cryptocurrency regulations. The bill will now proceed to the Republican-led Pennsylvania Senate after the upcoming elections. It will be sent to Governor Josh Shapiro for approval if it passes there. The Satoshi Action Fund (SAF), a Bitcoin advocacy organization, played a crucial role in crafting the legislation. SAF has previously helped enact similar bills in 20 states, including Oklahoma and Louisiana.   “Our goal is to mainstream Bitcoin at the state level and encourage lawmakers to establish clear rules for crypto,” Dennis Porter, founder of the SAF, said.  Despite the progress at the state level, the crypto regulation on the federal level is complex. There is still uncertainty regarding the classification of various digital assets, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to define which cryptocurrencies are considered securities subject to disclosure regulations. Debate Over Crypto Regulation Heats Up: Will Bipartisan Support Overcome Environmental Concerns? As Pennsylvania grapples with these regulatory challenges, the number of crypto owners in the state is on the rise, with approximately 1.5 million residents—about 12% of the state’s population—holding some form of digital asset.  This growing demographic could greatly influence the political landscape in upcoming elections, particularly in key races like the Senate battle between incumbent Democratic Senator Bob Casey and his Republican challenger, Dave McCormick, a vocal bitcoin advocate. The upcoming presidential election has further elevated the importance of cryptocurrency in Pennsylvania, a critical battleground state. Both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are neck and neck in the polls, making the views of crypto owners increasingly important. The outcome of the upcoming elections may further shape the future of cryptocurrency regulations, particularly as more voters engage with digital assets and seek candidates who align with their interests.  “A bill geared towards the right to financial freedom should be bipartisan,” State Rep. Mike Cabell, the bill’s sponsor, expressed optimism about its chances in the Senate.  However, he acknowledged that some opposition stemmed from concerns about Bitcoin’s environmental impact and a general lack of understanding of blockchain technology.   “The 26 ‘nos’ came from members with less of an understanding about blockchain technology,” he noted.

There were over 20k people inside the venue and tens of thousands more outside it. A week before the election, it feels like the entire country is behind him.For the last couple of months, I had been pretty pessimistic about Trump winning the election due to my concerns about the Democrats' plans to cheat the election. But as an American who is trying to keep his expectations leveled, it really does feel like there has been a huge shift to the Republicans advantage in this election. It feels like at least 80% of the country is now behind Trump, and I’m seeing a never ending stream of liberals and Democrats jumping ship from the Kamala Harris bandwagon. I’m keeping a very close eye on early voter registration data coming in and most of what I’m seeing are people voting for the Republicans. Even in swing states like Pennsylvania, voters are turning out hard for Trump. The sentiment is becoming more and more pro-Trump, and you can tell by the numbers too. Harris’ big interview on the Call Her Daddy podcast came out three weeks ago, and has only managed to get over 700k views on YouTube. In contrast, Trump’s interview on Joe Rogan was released only 3 days ago and has almost 34 million views. Trump's overall viewership online, the bigger and more authentic rallies, and optimistic support from everyday people is indicative of having far more support than his opponent. Even potentially in some blue states like New York, where the rally was last night. I don’t think Kamala could get that much support and attendees in a deep blue state if she tried.We’re only a week out from the election now, and if things keep going the way they’re going, pro-Bitcoin Donald Trump is going to win the election. If his promises are kept, then Ross Ulbricht will be a free man. Bitcoin will have a very regulatory friendly environment to have growth and innovation thrive in. The United States will establish a strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Gary Gensler will be fired. And the price of BTC will probably skyrocket into the six figures. But none of this will become reality unless people turn out en masse to vote for Trump. Like Elon Musk said last night, we need to make the margins of victory so big that the election cannot be stolen by the Democrat’s cheating.

Bitcoin Magazine,Money Electric: Being Distracted By Nonsense,"Mon, 28 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/money-electric-being-distracted-by-nonsense,As someone who wrote a book on the origin story of Bitcoin I felt I still had to watch Money Electric— perhaps just to comment on it in a Take. Even watching it for that purpose was a waste of my time.,"     Follow Aaron on Nostr or X.  This weekend I finally got around to watching Money Electric, the HBO documentary that “reveals” Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd as the true identity behind Satoshi Nakamoto. It’s three weeks old by now and already forgotten by the 24-hour social media cycle, but as someone who wrote a book on the origin story of Bitcoin I still felt I had to hear them out— perhaps just to comment on it in a Take. (As I am indeed doing now.)Even watching it for that purpose was a waste of my time. Sure, I could tell you that the evidence for Todd being Satoshi is very thin and circumstantial at best, but Rizzo has already done a sufficient job at that. I could also tell you that Satoshi’s real identity is irrelevant to begin with, since Bitcoin is a free and open source protocol that stands on its own, but that’s obvious too. Or I could emphasize once again that even if Satoshi really owns the roughly million bitcoin that are commonly attributed to him (itself a contested claim), he mined these coins fairly by investing computing power in mining, just like anyone else could have done.But I didn’t have to watch the documentary to tell you that. The film just doesn’t bring anything new to the table. Indeed, the biggest insult to Money Electric is that Vivek accurately predicted its contents about a week before it even aired: “someone claims they know […] Satoshi, theories start swirling, but no convincing evidence ever materializes. Inevitably it ends with embarrassment for the accuser.”Or, as Todd put it in the documentary himself: “The point is to make bitcoin the global currency,” but the people behind Money Electric (who, to their credit, left this part in), “are being distracted by nonsense”.This article is a Take. Opinions expressed are entirely the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine."
Bitcoin Magazine,What Ark Could Potentially Learn From Lightning,"Mon, 28 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/what-ark-could-potentially-learn-from-lightning,A rough idea on how Ark Service Providers could manage liquidity more efficiently to create a cheaper and smoother experience for users.,"      Ark is the third major Layer 2 protocol with some form of unilateral exit or enforcement mechanism on the base layer to approach the point of launching on Bitcoin. Lightning came first when C-Lightning went live in the Reckless campaign in 2018, Statechains in 2021 when Mercury Wallet went live, and now Ark Lab’s coming Arkade wallet implementation of clArk (covenantless Ark) is approaching the same goal line. clArk has some shortcomings compared to a full Ark implementation, namely the requirement in a trustless version for every user inside of an individual Ark to collaboratively sign the exit transactions in a massive n-of-n multisig when it is created. If we had CTV or another equivalent covenant, users would not need to participate in an interactive signing process, and the Ark Service Provider (ASP) could simply create the Ark using a covenant and users could be sure they have total control of their funds after it is confirmed. Ark presents an interesting trade off in comparison with the Lightning Network, both require participants to have excess liquidity in order to receive payments. In the case of Lightning however, it is a complicated game of individual users having to figure out where to allocate their own liquidity and how to source liquidity from others in order to functionally send and receive. It is an individual problem that each user is left alone to solve. With Ark, any ASP can freely assign some of its liquidity to any of its users. They still need to solve the problem of sourcing it, but there is no longer the per-user problem of deciding whether it is worth it to allocate liquidity in that direction, it can simply be done in the moment as any individual user needs it out of a common liquidity pot. There is still a problem with Ark’s liquidity issue though. For every payment floating on an Ark that hasn’t been closed yet, the ASP must front liquidity for those payments to allow users to receive them into a new Ark. When the ASP gets to a point where it is running out of liquidity, its fees must necessarily start skyrocketing in order to manage that issue until they are able to reclaim locked up liquidity by closing Arks. I think a way to address this tail curve of higher fees could be to explore some lessons from Lightning, namely a routable topology. This would be incredibly simple compared to Lightning. Lightning requires mapping and routing through liquidity paths established between pairs of individual users, whereas with Ark it is simply ASP to ASP. An ASP experiencing a liquidity crunch could “punt” payments from their own Arks to another ASP with more liquidity available, establishing the ATLC linkage between their own Ark the payment is originating from to another ASP’s Ark to be received, saving users fees. In turn as they are able to claw back liquidity as they close existing Arks and their own fees come down, other ASPs then experiencing a liquidity crunch could “return the favor” by punting payments back in their direction. This could establish a sort of round robin and easily analyzable “I scratch your back, you scratch mine” dynamic between ASPs, that while leaving some revenue on the table during high fee liquidity crunches, would overall create a more predictable and affordable experience for their users. This does come with the risk that payments across ASPs like this essentially interlink Arks across different ASPs, meaning non-cooperative closes would necessitate the closure of Arks operated by multiple entities, but given that cooperative closes depend on user behavior I don’t think this fundamentally changes the risk profile absent ASPs intentionally griefing each other. This could be viewed as analogous to the channel jamming problem of Lightning though. There are some upsides, and potential downsides, but I think this is a concept that is worth exploring in terms of ameliorating Ark’s liquidity crunch issue. "
Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Won't Let You Transcend Politics,"Mon, 28 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/bitcoin-wont-let-you-transcend-politics,Bitcoin is not an escape hatch to stop caring about the political process. ,"#Bitcoin 'er pic.twitter.com/hGsYHMBqot— ⚡₿itcoinTeddy⚡ (@Bitcoin_Teddy) October 7, 2024  We can’t transcend politics ‘because we have bitcoin now, bro’. Sometimes I see this kind of t-shirt or sentiment being shared online, but it’s simply misguided. Just to prove I’m not strawmanning, here’s another similar example: My condolences to anyone who pays attention to politicians 😅Trust math, not politicians.— FractalEncrypt ∞/21M (@FractalEncrypt) October 16, 2024  If you just mean “I’m not interested in politics” or you don’t like one particular party’s politics, that’s one thing, but it’s still not sufficient to secure your own liberty. As the saying goes, you may not be interested in politics, but politics is interested in you.Zooming out a little bit hereEven if we abstract away from the upcoming US presidential election, politics more broadly is about making decisions in groups, and a reflection of power relations among individuals. We are determining who gets to control which scarce and rivalrous resources, ideally in a way that enables people to live together while reducing conflict. In a sense, Bitcoin does help reduce conflict over ownership of money, using cryptography. But remember reality hereNow yes, we can talk about liberty, anarcho-capitalism and crypto-anarchy at a philosophical level. But the state exists today. So given this reality, if you want to secure your own political rights, it still matters to engage in some way. That could mean campaigning and contributing to bitcoin, economics and liberty focused education, it could be writing a submission to voice your opinion or lobby for a pro-bitcoin policy, it could mean being a part of a particular party, it could even mean contributing to secessionist movements and causes. But entirely ceding the political turf to your enemies is a bad decision. In some cases, it is that the politicians are genuinely uninformed on Bitcoin, and they ‘follow it’ by seeing news headlines. In these genuinely uninformed cases, having educated Bitcoiners speaking to them, and helping them not make major mistakes will be helpful. It can reduce the risk of bad regulations or laws on bitcoin self custody, transfer, mining, node running etc. This can reduce the risk of bitcoiners being criminalised, reduce regime uncertainty, lower tax burdens or otherwise. In other cases, there are politicians with an axe to grind about Bitcoin or Crypto, such as Elizabeth Warren with her “Anti Crypto Army”. In these cases, perhaps a more combative approach has to be taken where the community supports a pro-Bitcoin candidate instead of the anti-Bitcoin politician.But what about cypherpunks writing code and existing in crypto-anarchy?The late Hal Finney, Bitcoin legend and cryptography pioneer, was also libertarian and even he posted the following to a mailing list discussion (shout out to Aaron van Wirdum for surfacing this in The Genesis Book): “I am not in cyberspace now; I am in California. I am governed by the laws of California and the United States even though I am communicating with another person, whether by postal mail or electronic mail, by telephone or TCP/IP connection. What does it mean to speak of a government in cyberspace? It is the government in physical space I fear. Its agents carry physical guns which shoot real bullets. Until I am able to live in my computer and eat electrons, I don't see the relevance of cyberspace.”It’s not that he was philosophically opposed to liberty or crypto-anarchy, it’s that he saw the real world limitations for what they were and are. But wouldn’t it be nice if everyone got along? Kumbaya?Yes there is the idealistic sense in which “Wouldn’t it be nice” or “what if we all just respected each other’s rights and ignored the state” - but the reality is that “people won’t all just”. They see a system that enables them to steal from other people or to control other people, and they will take advantage of it. This can manifest in very simple ways where politicians promise “free things” or to protect you from the boogeyman in exchange for power. Given that many voters in democracies are not net-payers into the system, of course they will not think about the long term. They will not think about the risk taken, or the effort to accumulate capital and build a business. For these selfish voters, they will just take whatever they can get here and now, and not think about the future. Doesn’t Bitcoin Fix This?Won’t Bitcoin fix some of these things though? Yes, it is true that the state uses cheap fiat credit and control over the money to expand itself. Yes it is true that the state undermines competing forms of private governance, such as the family, the community, even religion and private charity - in order to install itself as the more powerful government mechanism on which people depend. As part of this process, more things are politicized, and this has taken place in most of our own lifetimes. There used to be unwritten rules about not talking politics while on a date, or in a polite social setting. That sense of decorum is now gone, and nowadays we all endure lectures about the latest ‘Current Thing’ even at non-political events.Even in the hyperbitcoinized world, there will still be family politics about things like family business, or inheritance battles or divorce battles. Or if we have monarchies and free private city governance, there could still be politics involved. The benefit might just be that it’s easier to opt out of it, and everyday people aren’t forced to participate. So yes longer term, Bitcoin will reduce but not eliminate politics. But don’t confuse this world now, for that world later on.If you think so much can be achieved politically, why have Bitcoin or code at all?There’s a division of labor here. Bitcoin and writing code is absolutely essential. But my point is more that those people good at party politics should focus on that, and those people good at writing and reviewing code should focus on that. Making the political system less hostile helps those people writing code, and it helps everyday HODLers who are holding their keys and running their node. After all, if Bitcoin and Bitcoin app code is improved, that could make it technically easier for people to use Bitcoin. In a broader political sense, writing code is reducing conflict by further reducing the cost of protecting money. It helps more people HODL and use their coins how they wish.Summing it all upYes it would be nice if less people used the state to steal from each other, or control each other, but the pathway to get there does not mean you should just kneel down and take beatings from the other side. Yes it would be nice if we didn’t have to pay attention to these things, but that’s wishful thinking. Even if you personally don’t have the proverbial ‘stomach’ to wade into the swamp of political activism in favor of Bitcoin, the very least you can do is not poo-poo the efforts of those who do have the stomach for it. Likewise, the people who can do party politics or political activism should not poo-poo the efforts of those writing and reviewing code to improve Bitcoin. Bottom line, don’t confuse the society you want, with the method of getting there. This is a guest post by Stephan Livera.

Notably, as the election date approaches, Bitfinex analysts expect volatility to intensify, particularly given the widely held view that a Republican victory may boost markets while a Democratic win presents more ambiguous implications. Options markets are also affected Option premiums and anticipated daily volatility for the US stock market and Bitcoin are projected to rise as election results are expected around Nov. 6 and Nov. 8.  The report added that Bitcoin might experience even higher volatility as traders weigh potential market shifts tied to the election outcome, especially if former US president Donald Trump is election to office again due to his vocally supportive stance toward crypto. Additionally, the implied volatility (IV) curve reflects heightened anticipation, with Bitcoin’s Nov. 8 strike prices suggesting IV levels above 100 for options with strike prices over $100,000. High IV typically drives up option prices as sellers demand higher premiums to offset the risk of sharp price moves. The report suggested that this elevated cost reflects a cautious sentiment in the market, which is preparing for substantial price swings in the coming weeks.  Options activity supports this sentiment. Over the past month, call options expiring in December with an $80,000 strike price have seen notable interest, hinting that market participants are positioning for potential price surges by year-end. Q4 strength showing signs Despite recent corrections, Bitcoin shows signs of its potential strength in the fourth quarter, a historically bullish quarter, particularly in halving years. BTC is currently up over 30% from September lows, marking a record-breaking 7.29% gain last month, a stark contrast to typical September challenges.  Although pre-election jitters may temper October’s close, historical fourth-quarter gains, averaging 31.34%, remain a hopeful indicator of bullish momentum. Bitcoin has not posted a bearish fourth quarter in any halving year. Additionally, the “Trump trade” effect plays a significant role in Bitcoin’s current performance, with macroeconomic factors and rising betting odds favoring Trump’s re-election feeding market uncertainty.  The report cited recent data from RealClearPolitics and Polymarket, which places Trump’s victory probability at around 59% and 64.9%, respectively, fueling an already volatile market.

Speaking on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Oct. 28, Sigel said that much like how new gamers are born every day, new Bitcoin buyers are emerging, contributing to a “very bullish setup” for Bitcoin. Sigel expanded on his comments via social media, comparing Bitcoin adoption to gaming behavior. “The interesting thing about Gamers is that they don’t stop playing in their 50s (case in point, Elon Musk). Well, they certainly don’t stop investing!” He explained that the analogy is one often used in relation to gaming stocks and is now being applied to Bitcoin to illustrate the continual influx of young investors willing to enter the market. He also pointed out that US presidential elections could serve as a key trigger for the next major move in Bitcoin’s value. US elections as a trigger Sigel used these remarks to explain a “very bullish setup” for Bitcoin as the US presidential elections are near, as Squawk Box’s co-host Joe Kernen asked about the correlation between BTC and risk assets. Thus, the head of digital assets research at VanEck stated that Bitcoin correlations change over time, citing the growing correlation of Nasdaq with BTC over the past 10 years: “Over a 10-year time horizon, the Nasdaq correlation with Bitcoin is a .19, quite low. Over the past three months, it is a .5, and that’s a two-and-a-half-year high, and that may be keeping some allocators on the sidelines cause they wanna see it fall.” VanEck sees this rising correlation as a potential precursor to a bullish rally for Bitcoin, similar to the pattern observed in 2020 when Bitcoin experienced heightened volatility after the US presidential election results. He suggested that the resolution of the upcoming election could once again attract new buyers into the crypto market, sparking a significant rally. Sigel also expressed his belief that Moody’s Corporation might downgrade U.S. sovereign debt following the election, which could further drive investors toward Bitcoin as an alternative store of value. He views the combination of rising correlations, election outcomes, and potential debt downgrades as setting the stage for an increase in Bitcoin adoption and investment.

However, the high amounts of leverage behind the impressive performance raises concerns about its sustainability. Leverage trading involves using borrowed funds to increase the potential return on an investment. It allows traders to control a larger position in an asset than they could with their capital alone. CryptoQuant data indicates that the Estimated Leverage Ratio hit a yearly high of 0.22 on Oct. 24 before slightly declining to 0.21 on Oct. 26. This ratio compares the open interest (OI) in futures contracts to the balance of the corresponding exchange. Bitcoin Leverage Ratio (Source: CryptoQuant) Last week, Bitcoin’s open interest had surpassed $40 billion for the first time, setting a new record in the crypto derivatives market. Although OI dipped to around $37 billion over the weekend, the market has rebounded by 6% in the last 24 hours to $40.08 billion as of press time, according to CoinGlass data. This unsurprisingly contributed to BTC’s price briefly climbing to as high as $69,225 earlier today. Bitcoin Open Interest (Source: Coinglass) While leverage can amplify profits, it also introduces significant risks, potentially leading to substantial losses and increased market volatility.

Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that with Emory’s investment, every major institutional category is now represented in Bitcoin ETFs, including endowments, banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, advisors, pension funds, private equity, holding companies, venture capital, trusts, family offices, and brokerage firms. Balchunas further highlighted that this broad representation indicates the rising interest in Bitcoin ETFs across institutional sectors. He added: “Absolutely insane feat for category less than year old, akin to winning all four tennis grand slams bf 16th bday.” Rapid adoption Since bitcoin ETFs launched less than a year ago, institutional participation has surged. According to a recent Binance Research report, over 1,200 institutions now hold bitcoin ETFs, demonstrating an adoption rate that far outpaces that of early gold ETFs, which saw only 95 institutional investors within their first year. Bitcoin ETFs have attracted both retail and institutional investors alike, amassing over 938,700 BTC in cumulative holdings, equating to approximately $63.3 billion in assets under management and representing 5.2% of Bitcoin’s total supply. These ETFs have not only contributed to market growth but also added a layer of stability, as institutional participation increases liquidity and reduces price volatility. Market depth, a measure of liquidity, has improved as capital from institutional investors and market makers flows into Bitcoin ETFs, leading to tighter spreads and steadier trading conditions. Institutional adoption has contributed to Bitcoin’s expanding role in traditional finance, as the flagship crypto increasingly appeals to firms seeking alternative assets within a regulatory framework. Emory’s investment reflects this trend, highlighting the broader acceptance of digital assets within conventional financial portfolios.

The surge aligns with rising anticipation around the U.S. election, as traders weigh potential pro-crypto policy shifts.  This latest move supports a bullish Bitcoin price prediction, as growing institutional interest and macroeconomic factors add momentum to the rally.

These tailwinds helped prop up crypto prices and US equities, despite fresh upside in US treasury yields ahead of a bombardment of US economic data coming up this week. Investors will be hoping this week’s Core PCE, ISM PMI and official jobs reports paint a picture of a strong but still disinflationary economy. Meanwhile, Bitcoin traders will also be keeping an eye on mega-cap earnings after Tesla’s bumper numbers gave a lift to overall risk appetite last week. Where Is the Bitcoin Price Headed Next? Chart Analysis Suggests Higher Pretty much whatever way you look at it, things are looking good for the Bitcoin price according to chart analysis. Bitcoin found strong support at its 50DMA last week and has had strong momentum since breaking above its 200DMA earlier in the month. That suggests momentum has swung in the bulls’ favor after months of consolidation and choppiness on either side of the major moving averages. The Bitcoin price has also consistently posted higher highs since bottoming out in August, suggesting a strong uptrend is in play. And the price uptrend since August coincides with an uptrend in Bitcoin’s 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which is yet to hit overbought territory.  Looking at the Bitcoin weekly chart, and the takeaway is that Bitcoin appears to have broken out of the bullish flag pattern it had been forming since March. The stars appear to be aligning for the next leg higher of the current Bitcoin bull market, with analysis of Bitcoin’s prior cycles lending further strength to this argument.  It’s now been more than six months since the April Bitcoin halving – Bitcoin’s tendency has been to consolidate for 4-6 months post-halving, only to then power to fresh record levels over the subsequent 12 months. Nerves ahead of the US election and upcoming data/earnings releases could encourage bulls to keep their powder dry in the coming days, with Bitcoin consolidation around $70,000 a possibility. But new all-time highs could be very near for BTC. The post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Touches $70,000, Hits Highest Since June – Where Is the Market Headed Next? appeared first on Cryptonews. "

Presidential Candidates’ Impact on Market Regarding the upcoming U.S. presidential election on Bitcoin’s price trends, Siegel explained that Bitcoin has historically reacted to shifts in political sentiment, especially when candidates viewed as favorable toward digital assets show gains in the polls.

Siegel stated that periods of dollar weakening often coincide with Bitcoin price increases as investors seek alternative stores of value. Another key factor Siegel mentioned is the correlation between Bitcoin and money supply growth, especially M2, which tracks the supply of cash and readily available funds. Siegel pointed out that recent Federal Reserve policy adjustments have led to a re-acceleration in the money supply, contributing to renewed interest in Bitcoin. In addition, Siegel discussed the influence of global developments on Bitcoin’s adoption. He noted that some emerging markets, particularly among BRICS nations, are integrating Bitcoin mining operations supported by government resources. Looking ahead, Siegel remarked that global debt concerns could further drive interest in Bitcoin.

The world’s largest crypto is up more than 3.2% in the past 24 hours and eyeing a retest of its record highs in the $74,000 as the US presidential election nears.  Markets are pricing in a likely Trump victory, which is seen as good for the crypto industry given his endorsements of Bitcoin and DeFi. Couple that with the Fed continuing to ease rates and a US economy still growing at a robust pace, and the pieces are there for a strong end to 2024. Bitcoin is in with a shot of hitting $100,000 before the year’s end, which would mark a 43% upside from current levels. For investors new to crypto, Bitcoin is a great shout for the best crypto to buy now. That said, more experienced investors hunting greater upside might want to pick riskier coins with a higher beta. Here are some strong candidates for the best crypto to buy now. Best Crypto to Buy Now Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) isn’t keeping up with Bitcoin’s rally on Monday, which fits with the same story of underperformance that has been in play since June.  ETH/BTC just hit its lowest level since April 2021, but chatter surrounding Ethereum’s potential “undervaluation” is growing.  This is exactly why $ETH is undervalued. People complain about ETH foundation dumping but if ETH was PoW, the price would have been much lower. Not to mention, ETH is at the cutting edge of research, even more than the memelords favorite Solana, because they have real value… https://t.co/7Vbkl1ncAt— Bitstein  (@Bitstein0x) October 26, 2024   $ETHThe market is massively undervaluing Ethereum rn pic.twitter.com/byRxoNudXq— BitBull (@AkaBull_) October 17, 2024  As Bitcoin surges to record highs, investors who feel as though they have missed the boat might go looking for the next high-potential play. And, still down more than 45% from its record highs, Ethereum could well attract attention. A quick 2x surge to take Ethereum towards $5,000 is possible, making it a strong candidate for the best crypto to buy now. Dogecoin (DOGE) Crypto’s biggest meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE), was the strongest performer among the top 100 cryptos on Monday, gaining 13% in 24 hours and nearing $0.16 per CoinMarketCap. Dogecoin is a dark horse contender for a crypto that might benefit the most from a Trump US Presidential election victory. Why? The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is likely to feature in a future Trump admin as head of a newly created Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) agency. DOGE was even getting shoutouts at Trump’s latest major rally at Maddison Square Garden in New York over the weekend.  They are talking about Dogecoin not Bitcoin or Ethereum at the Donald Trump rally. You get it?If you don’t have some Dogecoin go get some…pic.twitter.com/ySbLCW5F6n— 𝓣 𝓞 𝓟 𝓓 𝓞 𝓖 𝓔 (@TOPDOGE007) October 28, 2024  The narratives that could send Bitcoin to $100,000 are all set to benefit Dogecoin. Still, it looks likely to benefit from a further rise in cultural significance as Musk’s political prominence rises. Bitcoin SV (BSV) Bitcoin SV (BSV), a fork of the original Bitcoin blockchain, is another strong performer on Monday. Per CoinMarketCap, it was last up 10.3% in 24 hours and trading above $50. BSV is currently probing its 200DMA, and a break above here could trigger a fast 2.5x surge towards yearly highs in the $125 area.  However, despite its claims to scalability and adherence to Satoshi’s vision, Bitcoin SV’s long-term value proposition remains under scrutiny due to recurring security issues and a lack of significant, sustainable adoption beyond speculative trading. Alternative Option For Best Crypto to Buy Now For traders looking to turn high profits, crypto presales might be a better option. Presales offer the advantage of buying tokens at significantly lower prices before they hit the broader market, potentially leading to substantial returns upon listing if the project gains traction. Additionally, the volatility and speculative nature of presales can provide higher risk-reward scenarios than established cryptocurrencies like BSV, which might not offer the same price jumps. Analysts at Cryptonews.com monitor the presale market closely, looking for the next 100x gem. Here are some of their top picks.  17 Best Crypto Presales to Invest In Now The post Best Crypto to Buy Now October 28 – Ethereum, Dogecoin, Bitcoin SV appeared first on Cryptonews. "

Bitcoin Magazine,Coinbase Is Embarrassing Itself By Not Buying Bitcoin,"Fri, 01 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/coinbase-is-embarrassing-itself-by-not-buying-bitcoin,Coinbase is fumbling the obvious — stop buying back shares and start stacking sats already! ,"      Really, at this point, Coinbase is just embarrassing itself by not buying Bitcoin and doing silly buybacks. Coinbase just had a bad quarter. After reporting disappointing Q3 earnings, its stock plunged over 10%. To instill confidence, Coinbase announced a $1 billion share buyback. But that flopped, too, with shares barely budging.This whole debacle just shows that Coinbase is foolishly ignoring the obvious strategy here — buying bitcoin.Instead of share buybacks, imagine if Coinbase put $1 billion into bitcoin for its corporate reserves. That would have sent a real message. It would show they have skin in the game and truly believe in Bitcoin and crypto's future.Let's be clear - Coinbase should be all-in on Bitcoin's upside. This is the industry they pioneered! Yet here we are in 2024, and Coinbase won't follow the proven Bitcoin reserve model that is literally being flaunted in their face by MicroStrategy.Look, I am not any financial engineering expert to tell public companies what to do, but it's just too evident for crypto companies at this point. MicroStrategy started buying Bitcoin in 2020. And look what's happened — their market cap now exceeds Coinbase's! This software company, with 1/10th the revenue of Coinbase, has surged past the OG Bitcoin and crypto exchange. All thanks to stacking sats.How embarrassing for Coinbase! They've been around since 2012, when Bitcoin was $5. Just imagine if they went all-in on BTC back then. But it's still not too late. No more wasting money on share buybacks or lame projects. The solution is staring Coinbase right in the face — just keep stacking sats!It's painfully obvious at this point. Any self-respecting Bitcoin and crypto company must hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet. It aligns interests with shareholders and strengthens credibility.So wake up, Brian! No more excuses. Coinbase literally owes its existence to Bitcoin. It's time to go all in at last.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin All Time High Has Been Postponed — Please HODL,"Fri, 01 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-all-time-high-has-been-postponed-please-hodl,Who wins this election will dictate when we see a new all time high.,"     Follow Nikolaus On X Here  This is your captain speaking: Due to regulatory uncertainties regarding who will win the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday, Bitcoin’s price has fallen back to $70,000 under further notice — please HODL.Okay now past the cringe, Bitcoin’s price nearly hit an all time high of above $73,770 earlier this week, falling just $200 short around $73,500. As I noted last week, markets had been pricing in a Trump victory, which would see his positive policies around Bitcoin and other financial markets be put into place. Unfortunately though, just 4 days out from the election, there’s a feeling in the air that Kamala Harris may still win as she overtakes Trump in the odds of winning swing states Wisconsin and Michigan. This race will be much closer than what the markets have predicted the last few weeks. If Trump wins, many are expecting BTC to rise due to his favorable policies he has promised to implement. Bitcoin would be poised to grow significantly and even $800 billion bank Standard Chartered predicted $125,000 prices if Republicans can sweep the election.If Harris wins on the other hand though, things could be different. Due to her having basically no policies around Bitcoin (let alone any good ones) voters can only assume she is going to continue the Democrats’ 4-year long attack on the Bitcoin industry. It is pretty amazing that there isn’t even a public record, video or written, of her saying the word Bitcoin before. $700 billion wealth manager Bernstein said earlier this September that if Harris wins, the price of Bitcoin could drop to as low as $30,000.I think guessing $30k Bitcoin prices is pretty hyperbolic, and that it won’t drop that much if she wins. But I do believe it would severely delay hitting a new all time high until at least next year. I would love to be wrong on that though. As we head into this election, regardless of the outcome, I will be HODLing my bitcoin. While the price may fluctuate up or down heavily in the short term, it is still the best asset to own at times of uncertainty. And this is a time of uncertainty that will dictate massively the future of this industry in the US. With that all said, a new all time high has been postponed until further notice — please HODL.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin's Price Does Matter — A Lot,"Fri, 01 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/bitcoins-price-does-matter-a-lot,"It’s okay to be excited about bitcoin hitting a new all-time high. In fact, you should be pumped about it.","     Follow Frank on X.  Some in the Bitcoin space claim to only be in it for the tech, maintaining that bitcoin’s price doesn’t matter much to them. Whether they’re just posturing or whether they really mean it, they’re overlooking a major factor that keeps the Bitcoin network secure and healthy — the price of bitcoin.Lyn Alden did an exemplary job describing why bitcoin’s price matters in the follow post:Because money is a network good. Liquidity feeds more liquidity. And eventually broad enough liquidity feeds stability, which makes it more usable. Which then feeds more liquidity.It is similar to why we are here on this platform whether or not we like the recent owner.…— Lyn Alden (@LynAldenContact) October 24, 2023  Her main points included:The more liquid bitcoin becomes, the less volatile and more usable as money it becomes.Price is a market signal: five years of stagnant price action would send a negative signal to the market about bitcoin’s value.If bitcoin (a finite asset) was designed as a counter to fiat (an infinite asset), its price should increase as more liquidity is injected into the system (i.e., as more fiat is printed or more debt is created).   I’d like to help further Lyn’s argument by including the following points:The security of the Bitcoin network depends in large part on the amount of people or institutions that mine bitcoin. As the block subsidy decreases every four years, bitcoin has to continually increase in price for miners to remain incentivized to mine the asset.Bitcoin’s price adds to its legitimacy: the closer bitcoin’s market cap gets to the market cap of gold, the more investors view the assets as comparable.An increase in bitcoin’s price incentivizes holders to continue to do things to keep the network healthy, like running nodes, and to defend the network against its detractors. After all, as Jeff Booth says, “We Are Bitcoin,” and its success depends on us.So, if you were pumped when bitcoin’s price hit a new all-time high this week, good for you.Even if you weren't necessarily thinking about the points made above as bitcoin’s price reached new highs, it’s also okay to simply be happy about having greater purchasing power."
Bitcoin Magazine,Mathematically Forecasting Peak Bitcoin Price For The Next Bull Cycle ,"Fri, 01 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/mathematically-forecasting-peak-bitcoin-price-for-the-next-bull-cycle,Bitcoin’s Bull Cycle Price Predictions: What Historical Patterns Tell Us About the Next Peak.,"With years of historical data, we can observe the patterns from past bull cycles to become increasingly capable of making predictions about our current cycle. In this analysis, we take a deep dive into when the next Bitcoin peak may occur and at what price level.The Pi CycleThe Pi Cycle Top Indicator is one of our most popular tools for analyzing Bitcoin’s cycles. This indicator monitors the 111-day and 350-day (multiplied by 2) moving averages, and when these two lines cross, it has historically been a reliable sign of Bitcoin reaching a cycle peak, typically within just a few days. After multiple months of these two levels drifting apart due to the sideways price action, we’ve just begun to see the 111-day trending back up again to begin closing the gap.  Figure 1: Pi Cycle Top Indicator 111DMA has begun trending upward. View Live Chart 🔍  We can measure the difference between the two averages to better define Bitcoin’s position within bull and bear cycles with the Pi Cycle Top & Bottom Indicator. This oscillator trending up again hints that Bitcoin’s next bull run may be just around the corner, with parallels to previous cycles seen in 2016 and 2020.  Figure 2: Pi Cycle Top & Bottom Indicator ending its downtrend. View Live Chart 🔍  Previous Bitcoin CyclesHistorically, Bitcoin’s bull cycles exhibit similar phases: initial rapid growth, a cooling-off period, a second peak, and finally, a significant retracement followed by a new surge.2016 Cycle: This cycle saw a first peak, a dip, a second peak, and then a full-blown bull market. It's very similar to the trend we’re currently seeing. Bitcoin’s price reached new highs after these two retracements.2020-2021 Cycle: The pattern was slightly less pronounced, but a similar trajectory was observed. Bitcoin’s price peaked twice, once during the initial surge and again at the peak of the bull run as BTC was reaching an all-time.Using the Bitcoin Magazine Pro API, we can simulate different growth scenarios based on past cycles. Since the Pi Cycle Top and Bottom oscillator recently turned upward we can overlay the rate of change in the oscillator from the previous cycles to see potential route this cycle.  Figure 3: Oscillator and 111DMA projections based on historical rates of change.  If the 2021 cycle repeats, the 111-day and 350-day moving averages may cross around June 29, 2025, signaling a potential Bitcoin peak. If the 2017 cycle is mirrored, the moving averages might not cross until January 28, 2026, suggesting a later peak.Price ProjectionsUsing these dates, we can also attempt to estimate potential price levels. Historically, Bitcoin’s price exceeded the moving averages significantly at its peak. During the 2017 bull run, Bitcoin’s price was three times the value of these moving averages at the peak. However, as the market matures, we’ve seen diminishing returns in each cycle, meaning Bitcoin's price might not increase as dramatically compared to its moving averages as it has historically.  Figure 4: Potential targets for BTC this cycle based on previous cycle projections.  If Bitcoin follows a pattern similar to the 2021 cycle, with an increase of about 40% above its moving averages, this would place Bitcoin’s peak at approximately $339,000. Assuming diminishing returns, Bitcoin’s price might only rise about 20% above the moving averages. In this case, the peak price would be closer to $200,000 by mid-2025.Similarly, if the 2017 extended cycle repeats with diminishing returns, Bitcoin could peak at $466,000 in early 2026, while a more moderate increase might result in a peak price of around $388,000. Although it’s unlikely Bitcoin will hit one million dollars in this cycle, these more tempered projections could still represent substantial gains.ConclusionWhile these projections use well-established data, they’re not guarantees. Every cycle has its unique dynamics influenced by economic conditions, investor sentiment, and regulatory changes. Diminishing returns and potentially even lengthening cycles are likely, reflecting the maturation of Bitcoin’s market.As Bitcoin’s bull cycle continues to develop, these predictive tools could provide increasingly accurate insights, particularly as the data evolves. However, analysis such as this provides potential outcomes to assist in your risk management and prepare for every outcome.For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out a recent YouTube video here: Mathematically Predicting The Next Bitcoin All Time High"
Bitcoin Magazine,I Did Basically Nothing And Got $500 in Bitcoin,"Fri, 01 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/i-did-basically-nothing-and-got-500-in-bitcoin,Products like Lolli and Fold are like hacks – they make stacking sats that easy.,"     Follow Nikolaus On X Here  A couple of summers ago, I used to order lunch via Grubhub while working long days in the office. When ordering, I always made sure I was logged into Lolli, a bitcoin rewards platform with a browser extension, so that I earned sats back on my purchases. I eventually stopped eating out so much and began cooking food at home, and over time, I mostly forgot about how I used to stack sats on everyday purchases with Lolli. However, I recently checked my wallet and found 312,770 sats that had risen in value to be worth $220 at the time of writing this.Looking through my transaction history, the majority of my Lolli purchases were via Grubhub.  My bitcoin rewards for just ordering lunch  My bitcoin back rewards from my ~$20 lunch purchases are currently worth $3-4 each. As bitcoin continues to increase in price, it is pretty wild to think that the rewards I earned will one day be worth more than the purchases I made to get them… Honestly, it feels like the greatest financial hack that ever existed.Then, I remembered I had an account with Fold, another bitcoin rewards app. I logged into my account and found 300,416 sats, currently worth $226, just chilling in my wallet there. I also saw that I had accumulated my total rewards earned 1,057,710 sats, currently worth $750, using Fold. Again, all this for doing nothing more than making everyday purchases. Why did I ever stop using these products? I think I was just lazy and now I’m kicking myself at all the extra bitcoin I could have stacked if I had kept using these platforms — especially through the bear market…That’s when I realized the genius of these platforms: they don’t require customers to go out of their way to acquire bitcoin. They just allow them to live their lives and get rewards. They make it so that no real change in behavior is required, and people don’t have to invest their hard-earned dollars to get their hands on some bitcoin. Most Bitcoin companies cater to a pretty niche market that is more technical. But using these products makes me think there is another way to get people into Bitcoin. Bitcoin rewards apps are a clever gateway that my friends who are not into Bitcoin would probably think is really cool and would probably be interested in using to stack their first sats.While I wish I could go back in time to the bear market and redo all my everyday purchases utilizing a BTC rewards platform, I can’t. However, I can control my actions today and while moving forward — so I’ll be downloading these apps again. You should, too.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,The Whitepaper: The Simplest Ideas Are The Most Profound,"Thu, 31 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/the-whitepaper-the-simplest-ideas-are-the-most-profound,"The Bitcoin Whitepaper barely describes a tiny portion of the Bitcoin protocol, and vaguely, but the bits it does cover are the most important. ","      It has now been sixteen years since the original publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper on the cryptography mailing list. Satoshi went and dropped the paper in the place it would be best received, where all of the cypherpunks and cryptography nerds who had been obsessed with digital cash systems for years hung out and regularly discussed that and other related topics. The whitepaper was by no means even close to a comprehensive description of the Bitcoin protocol. It didn’t describe the scripting language at all, it didn’t go into a difficulty adjustment algorithm, it just vaguely described the concept of one. It didn’t define the exact protocol blocks were propagated across the network with (just a vague description), or the difference between consensus and policy rules. It didn’t define an issuance schedule or a total supply, just that it could be finite at some arbitrary value and eventually end issuance to support the network based solely on fees. None of the actual implementation details or specifics of the actual system were described in any way whatsoever. Just the general concept of a proof-of-work secured blockchain and how it could function without a central third party taking the role of record keeper for the transaction history to prevent double-spending. This is still a rather profound document given all of its shortcomings when weighed against the Bitcoin protocol itself in totality. Applying proof-of-work with a difficulty adjustment to the double-spend problem is the profound breakthrough that actually differentiated Bitcoin from prior attempts at digital cash, such as bitgold or e-cash. While the whitepaper itself is by no means close to enough information to reimplement the protocol as it stands today, it is enough to replicate a similar enough system. It’s the heart of it, the bits that really had to exist for the protocol we know to be brought into the world. Despite its lack of details and specificity, it will stand the test of time as one of the most important academic papers released in the 21st century. Everything brought into the world starts with an idea, and the ideas in this paper are truly profound in the implications and consequences they have had, and will continue to have on the world around us.

Bitcoin Magazine,The Latest Fake Satoshi is the Fake Bitcoin Creator We All Need,"Thu, 31 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/fake-satoshi-nakamoto-bitcoin-creator-we-all-need,The newest fake Satoshi Nakamoto is a refreshing reminder that the media needs to stop looking for Bitcoin's creator.,"A press release circulating yesterday proved yet again that there’s nothing the mainstream media loves more than some crazy nut claiming to have created Bitcoin.  Follow Rizzo on X.https://x.com/pete_rizzo_/  In honor of White Paper Day, the latest event, billed as the unveiling of the “legal identity” of Satoshi Nakamoto, attracted a who’s who of press, including the BBC, who were caught up in the Craig Wright scandal in 2016. (Wright was later legally deemed not to be Satoshi.)Even that burn didn’t stop their reporters from interviewing the latest man who’s claiming – without evidence – that he created Bitcoin, though. This time, our fake Satoshi is Stephan Mollah.No, it’s not the first time Mollah has pulled this stunt. He sued crypto exchange Coinbase all the way back in 2021, claiming that they stole his company name from him, at the time saying that Satoshi Nakamoto was his pseudonym and true identity. Long story short, the claim was so outlandish there’s even an online investigations company that uses Mollah as a way to advertise the effectiveness of their software.   Just look at this image.  You can follow the thread of the BBC’s reporting for the highlights, they’re full of his inane statements, as well as complaints from the reporters about what they had to sit through, including the “increasingly easy to fake screenshots” that he showed.“I created the Bitcoin technology, but I am not happy with it,” Mollah said. “I have evidence of all of that, but I am here to make the statement.” Mollah pledged to reveal the true details at some later date, finally showing the event for what it was, an announcement of a fake announcement.  The audience was riveted.   Still, after all the hoopla over HBO’s documentary, which went to extraordinary lengths to fake a convincing Satoshi reveal earlier this month, I have to say, Mollah is somehow refreshing. This is really the way all Satoshi Nakamoto reveals should be – total sideshows, devoid of any reasonable intrigue. Hopefully, if we get enough of these, we’ll convince the media to end its fruitless search for Satoshi’s true identity.After all, as Bitcoin Mechanic says, isn’t that all he ever asked of us? This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Forget Vampires and Werewolves—The Scariest Costume This Halloween Is a Money Printer,"Thu, 31 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/forget-vampires-and-werewolves-the-scariest-costume-this-halloween-is-a-money-printer,"Forget Dracula and werewolves—this Halloween, the real terror comes from a fiat currency money printer costume. While inflation haunts our wallets, Bitcoin steps in as the hero to save us from the horrors of currency debasement.","     Follow Mark on X.  Ah, Halloween. The one night a year where we’re supposed to be scared of things that go bump in the night. You know, your classic cast of characters: Dracula, Frankenstein’s monster, your weird neighbor who leaves their Christmas lights up all year round. But here’s the thing—none of those guys actually scare us anymore, do they? I mean, a werewolf might give you a mild startle, but you know what’s really terrifying? The sound of a fiat currency money printer. That, my friends, is nightmare fuel for 2024.Remember when Frankenstein’s monster was the height of terror? Big, lumbering, slightly awkward in a “do you even lift, bro?” kind of way. Sure, he was menacing back in his day, but now? Come on, Frankenstein’s just a misunderstood guy with a bad skin-care routine and no Wi-Fi. Dracula? The guy’s been outpaced by vegan diets and everyone’s obsession with garlic these days. Werewolves? Maybe once upon a time, but now we’ve got laser hair removal for that.No, the real monsters of the past just don’t cut it anymore. Today, we’ve got something far scarier, lurking quietly in the background, slowly draining the life out of our savings accounts. Forget the undead—this beast prints its way into our nightmares. Enter: the fiat currency money printer. Terrifying, isn’t it?Imagine this: you’re dressed up as a money printer for Halloween. You walk into the room, wearing a suit made entirely of dollar bills, making that eerie brrr noise. Suddenly, everyone’s blood runs cold. Forget vampires—this is the stuff of real terror. Because the truth is, inflation doesn’t just take your blood—it takes your hard-earned money and leaves you with less and less every day. Now that’s scary.Inflation is the ultimate modern-day monster. It sneaks up on you, slowly chipping away at the value of your currency, all while governments crank up those money printers like it’s a haunted house attraction they’re particularly proud of. Only this time, it’s not candy coming out—it’s debased, devalued paper that used to be worth something.So yes, folks, this Halloween, the money printer is the real villain. It doesn’t wear a mask or haunt a castle; it lurks in central banks and government policies. Every time that printer goes brrr, your savings are silently screaming in terror.But like every good horror story, there’s a hero. And in this tale of financial fear, that hero is Bitcoin. In a world where inflation runs rampant and fiat currency gets printed into oblivion, Bitcoin is the knight in shining blockchain. It’s here to protect you from the terrifying specter of currency debasement, offering a lifeline out of the inflationary horror show.Picture this: while Timmy and Sally are out trick-or-treating, they stumble upon a house where, instead of handing out candy, they’re offering something much sweeter—financial sovereignty. No money printers here, just the decentralized beauty of Bitcoin. It’s the one thing that can stand up to inflation and say, “Not today, money monster.”With a fixed supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin doesn’t play the “brrr” game. It’s like garlic to a vampire, or silver to a werewolf. Inflation can’t touch it. And as we all know, the scariest thing about monsters is when they can’t be stopped—but Bitcoin can stop this one.Happy Halloween, and may your portfolio stay spook-free."
Bitcoin Magazine,The Bitcoin Popularity Index (BPI) - A Measure of Bitcoin Interest Around The World,"Wed, 30 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-popularity-index,"The Bitcoin Popularity Index is a unique tool measuring global Bitcoin interest through Google search data, highlighting key adoption trends ","IntroductionIntroducing the Bitcoin Popularity Index (BPI), the first comprehensive search study of its kind. This index has been curated in an attempt to measure the global reach and impact of Bitcoin through a broad analysis of Google search queries.Unlike many studies that offer absolute data or blend various aspects of cryptocurrency, the BPI data aims to deliver insights of Bitcoin interest specifically, by considering factors such as language diversity, Google’s browser dominance and population sizes. This approach allows us to gauge not just the raw interest but also the relative intensity of Bitcoin engagement across different nations. We can therefore highlight which countries are punching above their weight, relatively speaking.While not intended as a definitive answer, the BPI serves as a useful exercise—perhaps the best snapshot we have amid imperfect data. By integrating these various elements, the Bitcoin Popularity Index offers a unique perspective, shifting away from generic metrics to provide a richer, more contextual understanding of how Bitcoin’s adoption is advancing worldwide.  Bitcoin Popularity Index 2024  You can download the infographic here.Key FindingsThe USA scores the highest number of queries with 14,432,650 queries per month, followed closely by Brazil with 12,400,260. Germany, India and Turkey complete the top 5. The top 7 positions and 8 of the top 10 are occupied by Western European countries (as per EuroVoc’s regional definitions).“Western” countries around the world have an average BPI of approximately 3,720 (compared to 1,250 elsewhere), indicating a relatively high popularity of Bitcoin.Africa has the lowest BPI scores among the continents. This is unsurprising given that internet penetration in Africa is only 40%.The most prominent Bitcoin queries are price queries, and more often than not the price of bitcoin against the dollar. In Egypt, however, bitcoin is more frequently priced in bars of gold instead of the dollar or the Egyptian pound. The total number of monthly Bitcoin-related queries is nearly 77 million, with direct searches for “Bitcoin” approaching 10 million. The ratio of Bitcoin-to-Ethereum queries is 9:1.A Comparison of ContinentsOceania leads with the highest average BPI at about 4,901, indicating a very strong popularity of Bitcoin in this region. This data is derived from just two countries (New Zealand and Australia), both benefiting from high levels of internet penetration. Europe follows with an average BPI of 3,719 from 41 countries, showcasing the relative strength of Bitcoin popularity across the continent, placing it well above most other regions.    The Top 50 CountriesCountries 1-15   Countries 16-32   Countries 33-50   Methodology of Data CollectionSelection of Data: Given that Google withholds all search query data for terms relating to cryptocurrency, identifying the most reliable dataset was important. In an effort to be as comprehensive as possible, datasets from SEMRUSH, Ahrefs, DataOs, Moz and Google Trends were all downloaded and researched. SEMRUSH proved to be the most reliable based on its accuracy and depth, which is consistent with SparkToro’s study as well as SEMRUSH’s own research on search volume data.Data Comparison and Selection: Although the results were often similar for the most part between SEMRUSH and Ahrefs, the two largest available datasets. There were significant discrepancies between the two for many terms. The data for some countries showed more than an 80% difference. This variability made it impractical to blend the data or fill in gaps for countries where SEMRUSH provided no data, as the differences were too substantial to reliably aggregate.Query Configuration: Broad match queries for “Bitcoin” and “BTC” were utilized across alphabet groups including Latin, Arabic, Hebrew, Cyrillic, Japanese, Devanagari, Perso-Arabic, Cyrillic, Tamil, Sinhala, Chinese and Thai.Incorporation of Demographic and Search Engine Data: Population figures were integrated from Worldometers, and Google’s market share data was sourced from Statcounter. For the purposes of this study, the Google market share was recalculated to 100% for all countries to standardize the impact of search engine usage on the data.Calculation of Per Capita Search Volume: With the aforementioned data, a per capita search query volume for each country was calculated. This step was crucial for normalizing the data across different populations, allowing for a like-with-like comparison of Bitcoin interest irrespective of country size.Data Visualization: The final results were categorized and plotted on a Chloropleth map using the visualization tool Datawrapper. This allowed for a clear visual representation of Bitcoin popularity across different countries, highlighting regions with particularly high or low levels of engagement.The percentage of a country’s population using the internet wasn’t factored into the calculations, since those without internet access are less likely to show interest in Bitcoin. Africa’s most recently published internet adoption rate is 40%, comparable to the rates in Europe and the United States of America in 2005. Although this rate remains low, it is increasing, as is the adoption of Bitcoin.    Scope of Data and LimitationsThe Bitcoin Popularity Index (BPI) offers comprehensive insights; however, it is constrained by the absence of data from 77 countries, including China, Iran, Cuba and 33 African nations — particularly Tanzania, Kenya and Sudan. This lack of data from key regions can result in an incomplete global perspective on Bitcoin engagement. Furthermore, the BPI is based on third-party estimations, as Google does not share specific search query data for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. VPNs can play their part too by obfuscating where searches originate from, but this is not expected to have impacted the results too much.The data is erroneous in a small number of countries, as “BTC” is the name of a phone company in the Bahamas, an internet provider in Botswana and a shopping mall in Slovenia.SummaryThe Bitcoin Popularity Index (BPI) provides a detailed look at global interest in Bitcoin through the lens of Google search queries. While this study employs the best available data, it is important to note that it is not intended to definitively answer which country has the strongest Bitcoin adoption. Rather, the BPI serves as a gauge of general interest and engagement with Bitcoin across different nations.The data reveals that Oceania has the strongest BPI scores, though Europe shows the greatest strength across the board, with 41 out of 43 countries performing strongly. It is also evident that search data is stronger in countries with higher internet penetration, thus creating a data bias favouring such countries. A valuable follow-up to this study would involve examining other metrics that could provide further insights into Bitcoin adoption. Some examples of those metrics include the number of Bitcoin nodes, Bitcoin Lightning Network nodes or hashrate distribution. Such data points could offer a more comprehensive understanding of how deeply Bitcoin has permeated different regions and could help paint a fuller picture of its global adoption.Furthermore, the goal is to make the BPI an annual calculation, providing a comparative approximation of how Bitcoin interest and adoption progress across all surveyed countries on a yearly basis."
Bitcoin Magazine,David Marcus: From PayPal President To Bitcoin Believer,"Wed, 30 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/david-marcus-from-paypal-president-to-bitcoin-believer,"Leading the team at Lightspark, David Marcus is poised to make the Lightning Network the biggest payment network in the world.","Company Name: LightsparkFounders: David Marcus, Kevin Hurley, Christina Smedley, James Everingham, Christian Catalini, Jai Massari and Tomer BarelDate Founded: April 2022; Series A May 2022Location of Headquarters: Los Angeles, CAAmount of Bitcoin Held in Treasury: N/ANumber of Employees: 45Website: https://www.lightspark.com/Public or Private? PrivateDavid Marcus is taking his experience as the former head of PayPal and Meta Messenger and applying it to building on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network.At Lightspark’s first partner summit, Lightspark Sync, he and his team rolled out new capabilities for the Universal Money Address (UMA) standard it launched one year ago. These new features will make it easier to tip, pay for subscriptions and invoice over Lightning (and in conjunction with banks in some cases).At the summit, Lightspark also unveiled a new Bitcoin L2 it has built — Spark — which is interoperable with Lightning and which enables users to use bitcoin (and stablecoins) non-custodially.I sat down with Marcus the day before Lightspark Sync to learn more about what drives him. We also discussed his strategy in harnessing the power of Bitcoin as a neutral global settlement layer, while still meeting everyday users where they’re at regarding what type of money they like to use.A transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows below.Frank Corva: I recently saw you post on Twitter that you were happy to be sick on a weekend versus on a weekday because you’re so excited about what you’re working on here at Lightspark. What about this work makes you so excited?David Marcus: Well, the general idea of changing the way money moves around the world is something that I've been obsessed with for a very long time. The fact that we can really change this for potentially billions of people in a profound way is a once in a generation opportunity that I get to actually work on with an amazing team. It's exciting when you start making progress and when you start to see product market fit.Corva: Some members of the Lightspark team just showed me the new capabilities of the Universal Money Addresses (UMA) as well as Lightspark’s new Bitcoin L2, Spark. You’re catering to both everyday people who want to move money globally and Bitcoin enthusiasts who care about self-custody. Is the strategy to just get as many people using your products as possible?Marcus: Just to backtrack a little bit — I don't need to convince you, but once you get the conviction that Bitcoin is the only thing that can actually be the internet of money because it's the only asset and network that's neutral enough to be that, then you have to wonder: Why hasn't it already won?If you go back and peel the onion, you start to see, first of all, bitcoin wasn't moving all that quickly or cheaply. That's where the Lightning Network came in. The problem with the Lightning Network, while it's been around for a while, was that it was really hard to implement, really hard to operate and really hard to maintain. And it wasn't super reliable for transactions.So, we invested a good chunk of the two plus years of our existence into really making an enterprise grade entry point into Lightning for institutional players, banks and exchanges. That really changed the game, because a lot of them were looking at the lack of activity on the Lightning Network and at the complexity of getting on the Lightning Network and then it became a self-fulfilling prophecy: there's no activity, it's too hard, I'm not going to do it   Corva: I’ve heard those complaints before.Marcus: We broke that cycle by launching Lightspark Connect. That was the foundation, because if you can’t make what I call TCP/IP packets for money — fragments of bitcoin on Lightning — work really well, then you can't do anything. That was priority number one.Then we realized we need to enable people to move the currencies they use for their everyday goods and services on the network. That's when we launched UMA, which is this Universal Money Address standard built on top of LNURL, and extended it so that regulated entities can not only be compliant but can also change in and out of bitcoin and get a quote from the counterparty they're sending to for the desired currency of the recipient.That was starting to really work, but then we realized, “Okay, we need to reach [people on] the network that are going to implement UMA natively across the world, but network effects are going to take forever.” That's where Extend comes in. It makes Bitcoin, Lightning, and UMA compatible with the legacy payment and banking rails, which is really critical.That's now launching, and we're seeing really promising traction with making the entire banking sector basically compatible with Lightning. People have the ability to send and receive money in real time 24/7, no bank holidays, no weekends, nothing. Then we realized that institutions are building on top of UMA and are offering the ability for their customers — whether they're consumers or businesses — to claim an UMA address, which is good for peer-to-peer payments, but there's so much more that we can do. That's where UMA Request and UMA Auth come in.Corva: From what I’ve learned thus far, these seem like they will be quite important for merchants.Marcus: With UMA Request, whether you're a business or an e-commerce site, you can request money from a wallet [that holds] another currency, and have the transaction settled on Lightning. Then there's UMA Auth, which is OAuth for money. It’s basically the ability for wallet holders or account holders that are UMA-enabled to delegate push and pull of funds with user set limits. If you make the credit card comparison, you can give your credit card for a subscription, but you don't set the limit.So now, if you look at where we are: We basically made Lightning the thing that moves bitcoin fast and cheap — really easy to integrate, maintain, and operate. We figured out a way to move fiat currencies on top of the network in a seamless way. We extended the network to make it compatible with the old banking rails. But what’s missing for Bitcoin now to win fully and entirely and become the true open standard for moving money on the internet? I think there are two things that are holding it back.One is self custody wallet support. If the network is a closed network and only works between custodial entities, we don't want that. We want this thing to be as open as possible. Also, for developers, if you need to ask someone for permission to develop something, to test something, to build something, then it's not like the internet — it's like CompuServe or AOL. Support for fast and cheap self-custody wallets on Bitcoin is something that we tried to figure out with Lightning, and it's basically impossible. I mean, it's possible but economically non-viable to park that amount of liquidity in front of every self-custody wallet for an eventual future transaction. Then, there are a bunch of different things that we explored with LSPs. They are either non-compliant or have a lot of other issues around how they move money. The second thing was stablecoins, which are basically a version of a US-dollar denominated bank account for people who can't have the real thing. As they grow in popularity and usage, if we can't make them travel natively on Bitcoin, then we're at a disadvantage. And so that's why we built Spark, which is what we see as a totally non-linear jump forward for Bitcoin that will enable self-custody wallets to interoperate fully with Lightning.It really extends the reach of self-custody to Lightning. It makes stablecoins a reality on Bitcoin, which they couldn't be as well on Lightning, because, if you look at Taproot Assets and [other protocols like it], they're pretty good on top of Lightning, but then you go back to the problem of pairwise channels for each of those stablecoins. In a world where you're going to have thousands of stablecoins, it's just not going to work.We believe Spark solves the last two problems standing in a way of Bitcoin becoming the internet of money. Corva: UMA Auth enables people to make payments within other apps. Was it challenging to build something that accomplishes this, something that makes payments and tipping not only possible but easy?Marcus: There are several things here to unpack. First of all, making Lightning work really well for regulated entities was really hard. Once you've done that, you need to build something that enables them to move the money that people want to use and do it in a way in which regulated entities can meet their compliance requirements. That's something that’s non-trivial. Then, the Extend piece is actually understanding how payment systems work and really doing the work — which is a lot of work — to make the network compatible with existing payment rails.So, A, it's a lot of work. B, it's a lot of understanding of not just how Bitcoin and Lightning work, but also how traditional payments globally work, what the regulatory landscape looks like, and what people, what companies and regulated institutions actually need to trust the network that they're going to connect to and offer to their customers. Corva: Do banks see the benefits in using Lightning as a settlement layer? In some ways, it seems like with what you’ve built, there would be no need for CBDCs, which would help keep smaller banks in business, because it isn’t a given that CBDCs will be able to be used for international remittances.Marcus: Some banks do, and some others will eventually, but they'll take a little more time. At the end of the day, if you build a more efficient network that enables global money movement faster, cheaper, in real time 24/7 and with no blackout dates, then that's where money is going to flow and the financial system and the ecosystem players are just going to need to adapt to that.If you're a bank you're going to be able to offer global payments to your clients at a cheaper rate and have a margin on top of that, which you know is going to be very comfortable if you're competing with the current alternatives — international wire transfers are still forty five to fifty dollars.Corva: You’re working with Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC) and the team from Alby. It seems like you really have your ear to the ground regarding new technologies coming to market in the Bitcoin, Lightning and Nostr spaces.Marcus: Absolutely. With Nostr Wallet Connect, there's actually a really good solution to the problem of delegating Auth, or delegating the ability to push and pull from a wallet with a protocol, that is starting to have nascent network effects in the Bitcoin and Nostr communities. It's really good work, and so why not extend it and enable more things to happen with Nostr Wallet Connect for mainstream use cases? That's the way we look at things. We look at what the entire community is building, we contribute to those efforts, and then we try to extend it to bring it to mainstream consumers so they can use it in a way that is going to be familiar and not foreign to them. Corva: Do you have any final thoughts you’d like to share?Marcus: We're really excited. We feel like all of these capabilities that we've been hard at work on in are almost two and a half years of existence are reaching a tipping point right now where basically there are all of the capabilities that are required for Bitcoin to decisively win at becoming the open internet for money, and now it's just a matter of executing, of finding all of the entities that are going to not only share that vision but execute it with us.That's why — to your point about me not wanting to be sick on a work day — I feel like this is just too exciting to not work on every day."
Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Is Having Its Best Year Ever ,"Wed, 30 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/bitcoin-is-having-its-best-year-ever-,2024 was the breakthrough year we'd long waited for.,"      I know, it’s a big statement, but really, the more I think about it, the more I’m convinced – looking back, 2024 will be remembered as the defining year for Bitcoin, the year Bitcoin transformed from magic internet money into a real institutional investment and financial asset.The evidence is overwhelming:- Pension funds and university endowments allocated to Bitcoin.- The long wait for a US Bitcoin ETF ended.- Wall Street giants like BlackRock bought.- Larry Fink changed his tune on Bitcoin.But most of all, a leading U.S. presidential candidate said he would make Bitcoin a monetary reserve asset. Now, read what I wrote again.Of course, some Bitcoin pioneers lament this institutionalization and cringe at the institutional embrace. Some say Bitcoin is betraying its roots. But for me, 2024 was the breakthrough year we'd long waited for. I entered Bitcoin in 2016, and feel like this year we finally crossed the chasm.Sure, it can be argued that Bitcoin's survival from the 2013 Mt. Gox hack, or its survival from the 2017 Fork War, or even El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 were all pivotal. All of these were big wins for our culture and industry. But, this year, we finally saw our enemies capitulate. As someone from India, I’ve long looked at Washington and Wall Street as the center of the global power structure. I know the world will follow their lead.So, it's soothing to see Wall Street and Washington finally admit Bitcoin's power and bend the knee. For many around the world, it’s the real sign that things are about to change. This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Bhutan - Another Country Using Bitcoin To Escape Poverty,"Tue, 29 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bhutan-another-country-using-bitcoin-to-escape-poverty,A first hand look at the effects of Bhutan's Bitcoin policies.,"Having invested in startups for over twenty years I have deep respect for entrepreneurs trying to build a company. It is so difficult. And more often than not, it doesn’t work out. Developing a whole country, of course, is much more difficult. Many leaders in developing countries don’t even try. They use their short time in power for their own benefit. But some leaders give their best shot. Nayib Bukele made Bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador in September 2021. Since then, the country has shown a remarkable development on so many levels. The Bitcoin engagement in Bhutan has been rumored for a while. A few weeks ago, we learned about mining operations in Bhutan leading to a significant Bitcoin stack of around 13.000 Bitcoin. That is a lot. Bhutan is leading the world with a Bitcoin stack worth around 30% of its GDP. Per capita every Bhutanese indirectly holds almost 0.02 Bitcoin, at current prices eight times the average monthly income. All of the Bitcoin mining is done with 100% clean and renewable energy, hydro power. Bhutan is the only CO2 negative country in the world and at the same time has the largest Bitcoin stack in relation to its size. That gets Bhutan worldwide attention.Having traveled six days through this truly beautiful country, then attending the Bhutan Innovation Forum and meeting so many great people including His and Her Majesty I learned a lot. About Bhutan, mindfulness, their development strategy and the role Bitcoin is playing. While traveling I happened to see two Bitcoin mining sites, both were fairly large.Congratulating Her Majesty, Queen Ashi Tshering Yangdon, on their Bitcoin strategy she smiled and offered to introduce me to His Majesty, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, the Fifth King. During a fifteen minute conversation with him he quickly stated „Hodl, hodl, hodl“. He discovered Bitcoin around 2011. Since 2019 Bhutan is mining Bitcoin. In 2008, when His Majesty became the leader of Bhutan at the age of 28, and several times after, he clearly stated his mission: “As King, I have pledged my life and service for the wellbeing of our country and people.“ His Majesty has been working hard for sixteen years to honestly do that. And it’s quite a challenge. The economy is running a deficit, dollars are scarce, Bhutan is highly dependent on India, a neighbor, who in 1975 made Sikkim, a neighboring Kingdom, the 16th Indian state. But India is also helping: Building roads, hydro power plants and delivering almost all the Bhutanese imports. The Indian Rupee and the Bhutanese Ngultrum are linked to each other. 70% of the Bhutan economy is based on agriculture, cost of living compared to average income is high, many young people are emigrating to Australia or Canada for better income opportunities. We have heard about domestic violence and alcohol issues, contradicting the notion of the Bhutanese being the happiest people in the world. Like in El Salvador, Bitcoin is not the silver bullet, it is part of a bigger plan of innovation and modernization. His Majesty’s biggest initiative is building a new center for entrepreneurs, technology, and mindfulness called the „Gelephu Mindfulness City“, a multibillion dollar project in Southern Bhutan. It involves attracting a lot of foreign investments and talent. The other big initiative is Bitcoin. Building on the most significant strength of Bhutan, cheap environmentally friendly hydro power, also its main export to India, the Kingdom has stacked at least 13.000 Bitcoin, maybe more. Expecting a significant value appreciation they are for the most part hodling. Only a little is sold. Bitcoin is about wealth creation. With the Bitcoin bullrun about to happen, in this cycle Bhutan’s Bitcoin stack could exceed its GDP and even foreign debt. Bitcoin benefits exceed pure value creation: They call Bitcoin the energy battery. In winter when there is a lot less rain and India uses less energy, Bhutan can use Bitcoin to import some electricity from India. Bitcoin gives Bhutan access to hard currency like the US dollar or the Euro. Selling and importing more or less everything to and from India Bhutan is notoriously short of foreign currency. Bitcoin mining creates technical skills. The Bhutanese are capable of running and repairing the mining rigs themselves. Bhutan easily can become a worldwide competence center for clean Bitcoin mining. The newly acquired skills can be expanded to other technical areas. For example, Bhutan implemented a digital national ID card on the Polygon blockchain. Using a wallet the Bhutanese have access to many government services. Around 20% of the Bhutanese have signed up for it. Know-how around Bitcoin and general IT can be the basis for attracting foreign tech investors and startups. Strategically, Bitcoin creates some independence from its strong and still benevolent neighbor India. China is not much of an issue for Bhutan. His Majesty builds the Bitcoin strategy on the few but distinct assets of Bhutan such as cheap energy, very good English skills, a world leading image of mindfulness and harmony with nature, the capability of not only preserving its rich cultural traditions and history. He aims to improve the happiness of his people including, but not only, its standard of living. Clearly, Bitcoin can be the key element and driver for Bhutan’s future. Talking about Bitcoin to government officials in Bhutan we sensed some shyness which makes a lot of sense. Bitcoiners don’t brag about it. Bhutan still needs a lot of help from developed countries and international organizations. At the conference I overheard the sentence “I tried to get him to sell, but he refused.” “Hodl, hodl, hodl”, is what His Majesty told me. For sure Bitcoin is creating significant benefits for the Bhutanese on top of value creation. At age 44, after 16 years in power, His Majesty seems to have the long-term vision to develop this beautiful country in the Himalayan mountains and plenty of time to implement it. As we can see around the world, it is a hell of a job. Bitcoin, clearly, is significantly improving the odds for Bhutan.This is a guest post by Alex v. Frankenberg.

Bitcoin Magazine,21 Million Fashion Makes Bitcoin Clothes That Are Worth the Sats,"Tue, 29 Oct 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/21-million-fashion-bitcoin-clothes-worth-the-sats,21 Million Fashion is a Bitcoin clothing brand that combines fashion and crypto – and gets the best of both.,"Look, I like a certain kind of Bitcoin shirt.   Follow Rizzo on Xhttps://x.com/pete_rizzo_/  Yes, the tacky ones with famous one-liners are fine, and so are the conference hand-outs. I, too, collect relics from crypto tragedies, holding on to my BitInstant and BlockFi t-shirts for posterity.But, let’s be honest. Who wears these kinds of things in public?When it comes to Bitcoin clothing, I still want something that fits into my day to day. Something that, you know, looks like streetwear, but that won’t attract attention, unless someone is really in the know. Sadly, this is easier said than done. That’s why when I was at the Lugano Plan B conference last week, I was blown away by 21 Million Fashion. I went back to the booth twice while I was there just to see if I wasn’t imagining it. First, you’ve got its standard “Cotton Sweater,” which retails for $230. This picture really doesn’t do the product much justice. The fabric is densely knit and really high quality. Also the design really has a lot of small details that makes it look worth the price.   Next, it has a whole line of bomber jackets, which (if you’ve seen me on the Bitcoin Magazine livestreams) you’ll know is basically my favorite fashion product. I wear them in place of blazers and basically have since 2017. Here’s the “Halving Bomber,” which runs a cool $320.   Again, the quality of this stuff really can’t be captured in images. The fabric is light and feels great. There’s a fairly wide selection of designs, and all of them are cool.Even the t-shirts, which cost over $100, feel worth the price. Look, I’m not here to convince you to buy from 21 Million Fashion. While I looked and looked, I ultimately didn’t buy. I’m on the verge of a key sat stacking goal at present, and am trying to hit my magic number – before Bitcoin runs away to $100,000. (Pray for me).All I’m saying is that, when I strike it rich on Bitcoin, there will be signs. Wearing 21 Million Fashion’s stuff will be one of them.This article is a Take.

After weeks of a neck-to-neck presidential campaign between the Democratic and Republican nominees, Donald Trump’s odds of being elected to President of the US are on the rise. According to betting market Polymarket, Trump leads Democrat candidate Kamala Harris by a whopping 30-plus points at the time of writing. Despite Harris incorporating crypto into her campaign, with the help of Mark Cuban, the Presidency seems to be slipping away from the current Vice President.  Trump has not brought up Bitcoin in a large campaign event in several months. There are numerous possibilities for Trump to court votes among the Bitcoin community by putting forth a Bitcoin plan with the intention of paying down the national debt. Trump Should Recommit To Bitcoin For example, it is time for Trump to reveal his intention of holding Bitcoin as a national strategic asset. He should outline an extensive Bitcoin policy, highlighting his plan to scoop up 20% of the Bitcoin supply or about 4 million bitcoins. He should position this as a way to pay down the national debt. To do so will take an aggressive Bitcoin strategy. Trump should outline it. Harris could do the same, but she is unlikely to do so. Despite a foray into the world of DeFi to the chagrin of Bitcoin maximalists, Trump has demonstrated an understanding of how Bitcoin can be applied at the nation-state level.  While announcing his national debt plan, he can extol all the different virtues of Bitcoin and how it can benefit the nation. For example, he has stated that, in his view, Bitcoin miners help to stabilize the energy supply and the grid. He committed to being an advocate for miners from his seat in the Oval Office. Trump posted  on social media: “Bitcoin mining may be our last line of defense against a CBDC,” He added:  “Biden’s hatred of Bitcoin only helps China, Russia, and the Radical Communist Left. We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!!! It will help us be ENERGY DOMINANT!!!” The former President, whose campaign has accepted crypto donations, has gone so hard after the Bitcoin vote, he even pledged at the 2024 Libertarian Party convention to commute Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht’s double life sentence.  Trump’s campaign rhetoric was early on shared by senior advisor to the Trump administration:   “…crypto innovators and others in the technology sector are under attack from Biden and Democrats” and “while Biden stifles innovation with more regulation and higher taxes, President Trump is ready to encourage American leadership in this and other emerging technologies.” Trump, to be sure, does not view crypto as currency nor has he voiced any support for Nayib Bukele’s Bitcoin legal tender law. That should change. Trump has a golden opportunity to be proactive and introduce policy as part of a campaign strategy to get elected. He should announce a plan to acquire a substantial amount of Bitcoin with the intention of paying down the national debt. Trump should guarantee the right to self-custody and create a working group to explore the possibility of creating a Bitcoin Standard similar to the classical gold standard. The U.S. could still create dollars. They would just have to be pegged to Bitcoin.  With the election only one week out, Trump can stir up further excitement with a clear Bitcoin policy: pledging to hold 20% of all Bitcoin in supply.

The move aims to use Bitcoin as a hedge against expected long-term economic risks, including inflation, rising fixed-income yields, persistent geopolitical tensions, and restrictive monetary policies. According to Strive, Bitcoin is an asset that can offer resilience amid global debt concerns and economic instability. Ramaswamy said: “Strive was founded to counterbalance the corporate tilt toward ESG. We’re taking that mission further with wealth management designed for financial independence.” The firm also announced an expansion, including moving its headquarters from Ohio to Texas. The new unit will be based in Dallas. Strive’s entry into wealth management reflects a broader strategy backed by a $30 million Series B financing round led by Cantor Fitzgerald. CEO Matt Cole said that Bitcoin’s inclusion aims to help clients manage risks like rising fixed-income yields and geopolitical pressures. He added: “We see Bitcoin as a tool for financial resilience.” The wealth division will be led by industry veterans Gary Dorfman and Randol Curtis, both of whom have substantial experience in investment management at firms like Sanford C. Bernstein and Morgan Stanley. Strive has built its reputation on offering alternatives to traditional environmental, social, and governance (ESG)-focused investing. Instead, the firm emphasizes what it calls “pro-capitalist” investing, appealing to a base of retail investors with its message of maximizing value without ESG constraints. Ramaswamy, who is an active advisor in former President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign, has consistently expressed strong support for Bitcoin. He views it as a vital alternative to the US dollar, emphasizing its role in holding the Federal Reserve accountable and preventing currency manipulation. Ramaswamy has stated that Bitcoin offers individuals an “opt-out from the broken financial architecture created by the US Federal Reserve system.” He has become known for challenging conventional corporate governance models through his participation in Strive and his advocacy for financial freedom. His involvement in both Strive and Trump’s campaign signals a shared interest in reshaping American financial and business practices. He added: “The moment is now ripe to launch a pro-capitalism Wealth Management business focused on true financial freedom, with a focus on integrating Bitcoin into standard portfolios.” The post Vivek Ramaswamy’s Strive to integrate Bitcoin as hedge against long-term economic risks appeared first on CryptoSlate.

Crypto Slate,Study suggests Bitcoin mining bans could worsen carbon footprints,"Fri, 01 Nov 2024",https://cryptoslate.com/study-suggests-bitcoin-mining-bans-could-worsen-carbon-footprints/,"Researchers from the non-profit organization Exponential Science and University College London have pointed out that Bitcoin mining bans might have unintended environmental consequences that could increase carbon emissions by up to 2.5 million tonnes annually.

In the paper titled “The Unintended Carbon Consequences of Bitcoin Mining Bans: A Paradox in Environmental Policy,” the researchers examined how concerns over Bitcoin mining’s environmental impact have prompted various governments to consider or implement bans on cryptocurrency mining. However, these well-meaning policies may have had the opposite effect of shifting mining operations to regions with higher carbon emissions. The research team, consisting of Dr. Paolo Tasca, Juan Ignacio Ibáñez, Aayush Ladda, and Logan Alred, utilized data from Nodiens to model the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining bans by assessing total carbon emissions across various countries. Environmental impact The researchers emphasized that mining bans in countries rich in renewable energy — such as Canada, Paraguay, El Salvador, and Norway — could increase emissions, thereby undermining these countries’ environmental objectives. For instance, Canada, which heavily relies on nuclear and hydroelectric power, might experience a significant rise in carbon emissions of up to 2.5 million tonnes annually. Paraguay, El Salvador, and Norway would also see increased emissions due to similar bans. Meanwhile, a ban in nations with carbon-intensive energy sources, like Kazakhstan, China, and Malaysia, would likely reduce emissions. Kazakhstan, which primarily relies on fossil fuels, could see a significant decrease in carbon emissions of up to 3.4 million tonnes if it adopted such initiatives. The study also examined potential bans at the state level in the US. It noted that Kentucky, Georgia, and Nebraska could experience reduced emissions with a ban, while New York and Texas would likely see increased emissions from similar actions. Unintended consequences The research suggests that bans on Bitcoin mining in low-emission countries could lead to a substantial net increase in global carbon emissions as mining operations relocate to regions with higher carbon footprints. This outcome contradicts the original goals of these policies. To address these challenges, the researchers advocate for a more nuanced regulatory framework surrounding Bitcoin mining. They stress that not all Bitcoin mining is equal, and it is vital to evaluate the energy sources used in mining operations before establishing regulatory policies. Further, the paper urged policymakers to reconsider the effectiveness of outright Bitcoin mining bans as a means to reduce global carbon emissions. Instead, the paper stated that the authorities should encourage renewable energy use for mining operations in high-carbon areas and provide incentives for relocating mining activities to low-carbon regions, which could better align with the goal of reducing carbon emissions while supporting the growth of the crypto sector. Margot Paez, a fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, echoes this sentiment. She believes that Bitcoin has the potential to facilitate a transition from the existing economic system to one that better aligns with ecological principles, ultimately helping mitigate the worst effects of climate change.

Crypto News,Bitcoin Whale Awakens After 12 Years – What’s Next for BTC Price?,"Sun, 03 Nov 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-whale-awakens-after-12-years-whats-next-for-btc-price/,"A 12-year dormant Bitcoin whale is back, sparking market curiosity. Discover the potential effects on BTC price and investor sentiment.The postBitcoin Whale Awakens After 12 Years – What’s Next for BTC Price?appeared first onCryptonews."," In an unexpected turn, a long-dormant Bitcoin wallet containing a substantial BTC stash has become active after 12 years, stirring up discussions among crypto investors and analysts.  The wallet, inactive since 2012, made a significant move, transferring 159 BTC worth approximately $11.75 million—a transaction that highlights the wealth accumulated by early adopters of Bitcoin.  The owner purchased these coins when Bitcoin traded at a mere $10.50, now yielding a staggering profit of around 700,854%.  This development has sparked curiosity about potential impacts on the cryptocurrency market, as well as the motives behind such whale movements.         A dormant address containing 749 #BTC (53,227,433 USD) has just been activated after 12.0 years (worth 7,974 USD in 2012)!https://t.co/5SzBYeKlk1— Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 29, 2024  On-chain data provider Whale Alert brought this transaction to light, alongside a series of recent movements from other long-dormant wallets.  These awakenings from crypto “whales”—individuals or entities holding large amounts of Bitcoin—could have short-term implications for the BTC market, given the substantial holdings involved. Why Are Dormant Bitcoin Whales Awakening? Recently, several long-inactive Bitcoin wallets have reactivated, sparking curiosity and speculation within the crypto community.  Among these, a wallet holding 159 BTC (now worth $11.75 million) moved funds after 12 years, likely yielding a return of over 700,000%.    A dormant address containing 28 #BTC (1,995,139 USD) has just been activated after 13.6 years!https://t.co/3hsKSsRpnV— Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 29, 2024  Other dormant addresses have also made transfers, with one moving 20 BTC valued at $1.46 million after 13 years and another shifting 14 BTC ($1.05 million) after 11 years. These reactivations may stem from various motives:  Profit-Taking: High prices present a favorable moment for early adopters to cash out. Liquidity Needs: Some whales may seek cash or diversification amid market volatility. Security and Regulation: Concerns about regulatory changes or access to private keys might prompt activity.  These moves underscore shifts in sentiment and could lead to short-term market volatility as long-term holders re-enter the market. Bitcoin’s Technical Outlook: Key Levels to Watch Amid the activity of long-dormant Bitcoin wallets, the BTC/USD trading pair remains under pressure. After testing resistance at the $71,850 level—coinciding with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement—the price has since retreated, falling below the 50-period EMA near $69,720.   This trend suggests that momentum may be weakening, with the following levels in focus:  Immediate Support: The 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level around $68,700 serves as a crucial support point. Should Bitcoin break below this level, the next supports could be at $67,280 and $66,370. Resistance Levels: Immediate resistance is seen at $69,660, with more significant resistance near the previous high of $71,850. Reclaiming these levels could potentially turn the sentiment more bullish. Technical Indicators: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently reads 39, indicating a bearish bias. Meanwhile, the 50 EMA around $69,720 has shifted to a resistance level, reinforcing the likelihood of downside risk.  With dormant whales now back in action and Bitcoin nearing crucial technical thresholds, investors may want to monitor price movements closely.  A break below $68,700 could signal further declines, while a push past $71,850 might reignite bullish momentum. Key Takeaways:  Dormant Whales Awaken: Several long-inactive Bitcoin wallets have been reactivated, including one that moved 159 BTC at a 700,000% profit. Market Sentiment Shifts: Whale activity could indicate profit-taking at current resistance levels or reactions to regulatory and security concerns. Technical Levels to Watch: Bitcoin’s immediate support lies at $68,700; a drop below this level could deepen losses, while a reclaim of $71,850 may signal renewed bullish strength.  As Bitcoin moves through a period of heightened whale activity and approaches technical pivot points, the market remains poised for potential volatility.

This combination of higher trading activity and short-term accumulation points to shifting market sentiment.  Key Takeaways:  Bitcoin trading volume and address holdings are up.

Discover how this rise could impact BTC prices and what it means for the broader crypto market.The postBitcoin Rallies as Robinhood Reports 165% Revenue Surge – What’s Next for BTC?appeared first onCryptonews.," Bitcoin (BTC), the oldest and most valued cryptocurrency, fell below $70,000 after reaching a peak of $73,000.  The global crypto market cap now stands at $2.29 trillion, down over 5%. Additionally, a recent transfer of 500 BTC from Mt. Gox wallets has raised concerns, adding to selling pressure.  The approaching US presidential election and ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East also weigh on Bitcoin’s performance.

These factors create a mixed outlook, with cautious sentiment offset by bullish retail interest. Robinhood’s Q3 Crypto Revenue Surge and Its Impact on Bitcoin Market Robinhood’s Q3 revenue grew 36% year-over-year, reaching $637 million, driven by a remarkable 165% increase in cryptocurrency revenue, which hit $61 million.

Gox Bitcoin Transfer Raises Investor Concerns as BTC Price Declines On November 1, approximately 500 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at $35 million, was transferred from a wallet associated with the defunct Mt. Gox exchange, per Arkham Intelligence.  The move was split into two transfers: 31.78 BTC and 468.24 BTC to unknown addresses.  This marks the first notable transfer from Mt. Gox wallets in nearly a month, though it’s unclear if it relates to creditor payments. The remaining Mt. Gox wallet balance is about 44,905 BTC, worth $3.1 billion.  Around 500 Bitcoin, worth approximately $35 million, has been moved from a wallet address linked to the defunct crypto exchange Mt.

Gox, once handling 70% of Bitcoin transactions, collapsed in 2014. Creditors have awaited payments for nearly a decade, beginning in July 2024, with a recent one-year extension due to system issues.  Market Insight: Despite Bitcoin dropping below $70,000, analysts indicate the price decline started before these transfers, suggesting market sentiment is influenced more by broader market volatility than by Mt. Gox-related movements.  Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Holds Critical Support Amid Bearish Signals Bitcoin (BTC) has retreated from its recent peak of $73,800 and now trades around $69,010, testing the crucial Fibonacci support level of 61.8% at $68,700.  This support is significant for BTC’s immediate outlook; a drop below could open the way toward the next support at $67,300.  Immediate resistance stands at $70,600, a level BTC needs to surpass to regain upward momentum. Further resistance can be seen at $71,800 and $73,800, where selling pressure may intensify. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Technical indicators reflect caution. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is near 40, suggesting weak buying interest, while BTC remains below its 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $69,700, adding to the bearish sentiment.  To reverse this outlook, BTC would need a strong close above $70,600 to overcome these technical hurdles. In summary, Bitcoin faces a pivotal moment. Holding above $68,700 could support stability, but a decisive move above $70,600 is necessary to shift market sentiment positively. – You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034  Join the Epic FreeDum Fighters Showdown: MAGATRON vs. Kamacop!

As part of its expansion, Strive is relocating its headquarters from Columbus, Ohio, to Dallas, where it will add new wealth management staff to better serve family offices and affluent individuals, according to a recent press release. While Strive currently offers traditional stock and bond funds, the decision to include Bitcoin reflects the firm’s intention to appeal to high-net-worth clients in Texas, which has attracted a strong conservative following and significant interest in digital assets. Financial Firms Provide Diverse Options to Clients Strive’s move indicates an increasing trend among financial firms to provide diverse options for clients. Led by Gary Dorfman and Randol Curtis, Strive’s new wealth management division will incorporate Bitcoin as a key element in standard portfolios. The move comes amid Bitcoin’s rising value and support among conservative circles and Texas’s emergence as a hub for cryptocurrency advocates. Additionally, a new stock exchange rejecting environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies is set to open in Dallas, aligning with the pro-capitalist stance of Strive’s leadership. Strive, launched in 2022 by biotech entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, advocates a post-ESG approach and positioned itself as an alternative to what it sees as “woke” corporate practices.  DJT Advisor @VivekGRamaswamy Pivots His Asset Management Business Strive (AUM = $1.7B) to Include #Bitcoin Cites unsustainable global debt, rising bond yields, inflationary pressures, geopolitical pressures, & restrictive monetary controls. https://t.co/eNjTUi53ZV pic.twitter.com/YpeCrEDIrl— matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) November 1, 2024  The firm’s first product, an energy ETF labeled DRLL, invests in U.S. fossil fuel companies and has prioritized shareholder value over social considerations. Ramaswamy remains a key advisor and the majority shareholder, supported by investors like JD Vance’s Narya Capital and venture capitalists Peter Thiel and Bill Ackman, all of whom share conservative viewpoints. Asset manager Cantor Fitzgerald, a significant stakeholder, also sits on Strive’s board. “Just two short years later, the national environment has changed dramatically, in no small part due to Strive’s efforts,” Ramaswamy commented. “The moment is now ripe to launch a pro-capitalism Wealth Management business focused on true financial freedom, with a focus on integrating Bitcoin into standard portfolios. I wish the team great success in the next stage of Strive’s incredible journey.” More Firms Adopt Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset The ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, characterized by increasing inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions, have prompted corporate treasurers to explore including Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Just recently, the digital asset prime services platform Abra launched a service designed for corporations seeking to hold cryptocurrencies as reserve assets on their balance sheets. Likewise, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has been actively increasing its Bitcoin holdings since May, when it announced plans to use Bitcoin as a strategic treasury reserve. The move was driven by Japan’s economic challenges, including high government debt, negative interest rates, and a weakening yen. In addition to its Bitcoin purchase, Metaplanet revealed it will exercise stock acquisition rights, generating 299.7 million yen to fund further Bitcoin acquisitions. The firm also partnered with SBI VC Trade, the crypto subsidiary of SBI Group, to access corporate custody services that optimize tax efficiency and provide potential financing options using bitcoin as collateral. Earlier this month, the firm raised approximately 10 billion yen ($66 million) through a stock acquisition rights offering, attracting 13,774 individual shareholders.

In this article, we’ll examine the latest BSV price trends and discover whether there are higher-profiting plays available in the November crypto market environment. Bitcoin SV, a well-known Bitcoin hard fork championed by Craig Wright, has recently rallied to test significant local resistance. Notably, prominent traders on crypto Twitter anticipate a potential rejection from this supply zone in the near term.  $BSV is between the supply area and the uptrend line on the daily time frame. The price may be rejected from this area. https://t.co/v58sxGk2G1 pic.twitter.com/a6Y3DObxBZ— King Koko  (@Im_KingKoko) October 29, 2024  This comes after BSV price pushed up amid excitement at Bitcoin’s retest of the price range above $70K, although the energy seems to be dissipating into the weekend.  BSV Price Analysis: Will Bitcoin SV Reject From Local Supply Zone as BTC Loses $70K As Bitcoin SV struggles at the supply zone, BSV is currently trading at a market price of $51.38 (representing a 24-hour change of -0.5%). This comes amid an influx of +$26.75M in trading volume on the tail-end of the early-week pump, with Bitcoin SV’s valuation now sitting at a strong market cap of $1,080,821,224.  With BSV holders no doubt happy at the $1Bn market cap, Bitcoin SV price is finding support above the 20DMA following the localized retracement move, with a layer of support at the $50 mark. Now pushing back to the upside, BSV bulls are targeting a higher support level in the ascendant trading channel at $52.5 after the 200DMA provided a successful retest of baseline support down at $48.  A degree of consolidation could be on the cards heading into Saturday, with the RSI still technically in a bearish divergence at 56.66. Yet, if Bitcoin recovers the 70K range, then BSV price is likely to break out above the supply zone feared on crypto Twitter to chase much higher returns.

The latest report shows a slower labor market and potential rate cuts. How will Bitcoin respond to this economic backdrop as investors watch closely?The postBitcoin Price Choppy as Soft US Jobs Data Feeds Fed Rate Cut Bets – Where Is BTC Headed Next?appeared first onCryptonews."," The Bitcoin (BTC) price experienced volatility on Friday following soft US jobs data, which reinforced market expectations of two more interest rate cuts by the Fed this year. Following the jobs data, Bitcoin reached a high of $71,500 before falling back to $69,000. At the time of writing, BTC hovers around $70,000. Source: TradingView / BTCUSD Data on Friday showed the US economy added only 12,000 jobs in October, significantly below the expected 106,000.  August and September job numbers were also revised downward, subtracting 112,000 jobs from previous reports.  BREAKING: The Labor Department has revised the last TWO jobs reports LOWER by a combined 112,000 jobs.Initially reported numbers showed that the US added 254,000 jobs in September which was just revised down by 31,000, to 223,000.At the same time, the August jobs report was… pic.twitter.com/t4x6xge44G— The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) November 1, 2024  While the unemployment rate stayed at 4.1%, the latest figures depict a softening labor market.

El-Erian (@elerianm) November 1, 2024  Where is the Bitcoin Price Headed Next? The latest US jobs numbers indicate a medium- to long-term supportive backdrop for the Bitcoin price.  While the US labor market shows signs of softening, it may not be as severe as recent figures suggest.  Combined with robust reports this week on GDP and personal spending, these signs point to a resilient US economy even as the Fed lowers short-term interest rates.  This environment is seen as favorable for risk assets like stocks and crypto, which are expected to perform well. Currently, the US Presidential election draws more attention than economic factors. With the election next week, uncertainty around the outcome has added to market volatility. Ex-President Trump’s odds have been slipping in the betting markets, potentially as traders hedge their bets, and potentially to reflect recent gaffes (like a comedian insulting Puerto Rico at a recent Trump rally).   Trump's odds are down 5.6% today. Trump • 60.9% chance Harris • 39.1% chance4 days to go. pic.twitter.com/FFzTdYgkTq— Polymarket (@Polymarket) October 31, 2024  Trump is perceived as more pro-crypto, so decreasing confidence in his chances may be prompting profit-taking, affecting the Bitcoin price on Friday.  Ahead of the election, traders should expect further price swings.  A Trump victory could act as an immediate catalyst for BTC price upside, while a Kamala Harris win may lead those betting on Trump to sell, potentially triggering a short-term price dip. However, a potential Harris administration is expected to take a more neutral stance on crypto than the Biden administration did.  Any rebound in BTC price may be temporary. As delayed effects from this year’s Bitcoin halving take hold, analysts suggest a strong end to 2024, with the potential for Bitcoin to reach $100,000.

Bitcoin Magazine,I’m Grateful for Trump’s Embrace of Bitcoin,"Mon, 04 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/im-grateful-for-trumps-embrace-of-bitcoin,"As the U.S. faces the most consequential election of our lifetime, the Trump administration offers an unprecedented opportunity for the Bitcoin community. ","      Co-founder of BTC Media eleven years ago, I am passionate about the future of Bitcoin – and in the spirit of free speech and democracy on this election eve – I feel compelled to share my first Bitcoin Magazine opinion article. Weeks ago our editor-in-chief, Aaron Van Wirdum, published his Take, “Trump Does Not Give a Damn About Bitcoin,” and he invited submissions of a counter-take.Our company was founded on the mission of hyperbitcoinization. Since the beginning, educating Main Street on Bitcoin has been core to our values. We’ve made great strides. I believe Trump – as standing president – with pro-Bitcoin advisors, could significantly fast-track Main Street’s embrace of Bitcoin, create the world’s most pro-Bitcoin economy, and commute Ross Ulbricht’s sentence… a powerful trifecta.The resounding skepticism found in Aaron's TAKE is not a sentiment that I share; rather, I trust in Trump's declared support for Bitcoin. His inner circle is full of fervent Bitcoiners and those who have signaled support for Bitcoin: his children, JD Vance, Elon Musk, RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Vivek Ramaswamy, Senators Lummis, Blackburn, Hagerty and Scott plus many, many more. As a newcomer to the Bitcoin space, Trump, like many, is still learning. I recognize and appreciate his ever-student curiosity and desire to fully grasp the future of money. A U.S. president with exposure to Bitcoin, who surrounds himself with pro-Bitcoin advisors and policies, is certainly a more favorable alternative than the openly-hostile administrations of the past and present. In Aaron’s TAKE, Trump was chastised for failing to transact his own bitcoin purchase at a campaign stop at PubKey – a Bitcoin bar in Greenwich Village; again, there is no stone to throw here. I was elated that Trump accepted PubKey owner Thomas Pacchia’s invitation to make a campaign stop (and as I understand it, that was an invitation extended to both V.P. Harris and Trump, with only Trump accepting). The transaction was a gesture, facilitated by the community, and was a well-received and celebratory moment for that small business and for the global network of Bitcoin businesses that have struggled for this level of acceptance by politicians.Like others, you might be questioning if donations and votes are the driving force of Trump’s interest in Bitcoin. Does it actually matter what drives any of us as we strive for a common good? We are a diverse community with diverse reasons for embracing Bitcoin — whether a desire for financial sovereignty, an investment opportunity, a sudden inability to purchase basic necessities during a protest, a distrust in the existing financial system and, yes, even politicians seeking the Bitcoin community’s support through donations and votes. The Bitcoin Community knows Bitcoin will flourish and thrive in spite of politics; however, not all issues are apolitical. At Nashville’s Bitcoin 2024 conference (and the Libertarian National Convention), Trump stated, unequivocally, that he will free Ross Ulbricht if given the opportunity as President. The Ulbricht family needs a miracle, and it is Trump who pledges to deliver it. I had the golden opportunity to meet Trump backstage at Bitcoin 2024 (alongside two strong, intelligent women – his granddaughter Kai and her mother Vanessa). I found Trump to be warm, humorous, and sincere. I wholeheartedly welcome Trump to Bitcoin and appreciate bipartisanship support in freeing Ross and our mission of hyperbitcoinization.I encourage you all to vote this Tuesday, and to join Bitcoin Magazine and Stand With Crypto for The Road to Election Day, live from Las Vegas, this Tuesday, November 5, 2024, beginning at 3 p.m. PST. This article is a Take. Opinions expressed are entirely the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine."

The strong performance, coupled with recent Bitcoin price increases around $70,000, lifted the sector’s total assets under management (AuM) above $100 billion for only the second time. These levels were last seen in early June 2024, when AuM reached $102 billion. Meanwhile, the increase in assets has also spurred a surge in trading activity, with weekly trading volumes climbing 67% to $19.2 billion. This figure represents 35% of all Bitcoin trading on leading, reliable exchanges. James Butterfill, CoinShares’ head of research, attributed the recent surge to investor optimism ahead of the impending US elections where former US president Donald Trump stands against Vice President Kamala Harris. According to Butterfill: “We believe euphoria around the prospect of a Republican victory were the likely reason for these inflows as they were in the first few days of last week, as polls have turned, we saw minor outflows on Friday, highlighting how sensitive Bitcoin is to the US elections at present.” Bitcoin leads with record inflows A look at the asset flows shows that Bitcoin captured nearly all last week’s inflows, totaling $2.2 billion. According to the report, US-listed Bitcoin ETFs mainly saw strong interest with $2.22 billion in net inflows—the third-largest weekly inflow on record. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF led the pack, pulling in $2.2 billion. It was followed by Fidelity’s FBTC, which saw around $90 million in inflows. These numbers show that crypto ETFs continue to attract strong interest. Assets in these funds have grown rapidly and reached about half the level of gold ETFs in a relatively short period. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s recent price surge above $70,000 for the first time since June appeared to have attracted bearish sentiments from traders betting against further price increases. CoinShares reported that the price uptick spurred new inflows of $8.9 million into short-Bitcoin products. Despite the solid positive sentiments in the market, Ethereum-related products saw modest inflows totaling $9.5 million last week. Butterfill explained that these numbers contrasted with the strong investor interest in Bitcoin and Solana. Last week, alternative digital assets like Solana, Polkadot, and Arbitrum collectively had around  $6.57 million in cumulative inflows.

Per the announcement on Monday, Nov. 4,  increasing renewable energy production presents challenges in stabilizing the energy grid, as irregular production peaks occur depending on weather conditions. Deutsche Telekom understands that Bitcoin mining could be crucial in balancing supply and demand within the grid. This method has already been successful in countries like the United States and Finland, and the pilot project seeks to validate its effectiveness in Germany. The mining operations are hosted by Metis Solutions GmbH and located at Riva GmbH Engineering’s facilities in Backnang, Germany. Riva Engineering, a manufacturer of metal and glass facades, generates its own electricity through a photovoltaic system. Telekom MMS is responsible for operating the mining devices, while Bankhaus Metzler is involved in defining test runs and analyzing data, exploring further possibilities for financial services with digital assets. Oliver Nyderle, Head of Digital Trust & Web3 Infrastructure at Deutsche Telekom MMS, stated that the project is a step toward testing the regulatory effect of Bitcoin miners on the energy grid. He said, “Surplus energy is converted into digital values through the miners. We call this digital monetary photosynthesis.” Hendrik König, Head of the Digital Assets Office at Bankhaus Metzler, emphasized gaining experience in blockchain technology applications. “Our goal is to further advance the innovative power of blockchain technology in Germany,” he noted. The bank established its Digital Assets Office in 2022 to focus exclusively on blockchain technology and the digital assets ecosystem. Telekom MMS has been providing infrastructure for various decentralized protocols in the Web3 sector, including networks like Chainlink, Fetch.ai, and Polygon. In 2023, Telekom expanded its portfolio by operating a Bitcoin node, marking its first involvement with a proof-of-work network. The pilot project aims to gather field data and insights to plan subsequent initiatives, potentially contributing to stabilizing the energy grid during fluctuations. Wind power producers and photovoltaic plant operators could benefit from this technology, addressing the challenge of unpredictable regulating power.

Crypto News,Deutsche Telekom Subsidiary Partners with Bankhaus Metzler for Green Bitcoin Mining Initiative,"Mon, 04 Nov 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/deutsche-telekom-subsidiary-partners-with-bankhaus-metzler-for-green-bitcoin-mining-initiative/,"Deutsche Telekom's subsidiary MMS has partnered with Bankhaus Metzler to pilot a Bitcoin mining project in Germany, utilizing surplus renewable energy to stabilize the energy grid and convert excess power into digital assets.The postDeutsche Telekom Subsidiary Partners with Bankhaus Metzler for Green Bitcoin Mining Initiativeappeared first onCryptonews."," In one of the latest crypto moves in Europe, Deutsche Telekom’s subsidiary MMS has partnered with Bankhaus Metzler to pilot a Bitcoin mining project using surplus renewable energy in Germany. The initiative aims to harness excess energy generated from renewable sources like wind and solar to power Bitcoin mining infrastructure, creating a potential new tool for balancing the energy grid.  This surplus power, often underutilized due to grid limitations and a lack of storage capacity, will fuel the mining project situated at Riva GmbH Engineering’s facility in Backnang, Germany.  MMS will manage the mining operations, while Bankhaus Metzler evaluates financial service applications for digital assets. The project aims to gather field data and insights and demonstrate how surplus energy can be efficiently converted into digital assets, an approach they call “digital monetary photosynthesis.”  The project is expected to provide critical insights that could influence future Bitcoin mining applications in energy grid management. Deutsche Telekom Bitcoin Mining: Balancing Renewable Energy Surplus Germany’s increase in renewable energy sources has introduced challenges in balancing the national grid, as energy production varies significantly with weather patterns.  By converting surplus energy into Bitcoin, Deutsche Telekom MMS and Bankhaus Metzler hope to create a reliable method for managing fluctuations in energy availability.  With their capacity to adjust power usage quickly, Bitcoin miners offer a flexible load that can absorb surplus energy during production peaks, thus helping stabilize the grid.  This approach has already succeeded in countries like the United States and Finland, where Bitcoin mining is integrated into grid management. The pilot is hosted by Metis Solutions GmbH, and the mining containers are set up at Riva GmbH, which generates its own electricity from an on-site photovoltaic system.  This setup is designed to transform excess energy into digital value while potentially reducing the strain on Germany’s grid during high-production periods.  According to Oliver Nyderle, head of Digital Trust and Web3 Infrastructure at Deutsche Telekom MMS, this flexible and responsive approach to grid regulation is becoming increasingly necessary as renewable energy sources expand. She emphasized;  “For this, we need mechanisms that can respond quickly to changes and absorb fluctuations.”  Bankhaus Metzler’s Exploration into Digital Asset Services Bankhaus Metzler, Germany’s second-oldest bank, sees this project as a step toward advancing blockchain technology beyond traditional financial applications.  Through the pilot, the bank’s Digital Assets Office (DAO) is exploring the potential for financial services built around digital assets like Bitcoin.  Head of Digital Assets at Bankhaus Metzler, Hendrik König, also emphasized the growing importance of blockchain technology;  “Our goal is to gain experience in various application areas to further advance the innovative power of blockchain technology in Germany. [..] Blockchain technology is gaining increasing importance in operational business outside the financial industry.”  Notably, Riot Platforms, a crypto mining company, recently reported a massive 65% revenue increase in Q3 2024, reaching $84.8 million, largely due to its expanded hashrate of 28 EH/s.  Riot Platforms Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results, Current Operational and Financial Highlights. $84.8 million in Total Revenue and Deployed Hash Rate of 28 EH/s.“I’m pleased to announce Riot’s results for the third quarter 2024, the first full quarter past the… pic.twitter.com/bbEno5GOkz— Riot Platforms, Inc. (@RiotPlatforms) October 30, 2024  This growth enabled Riot to mine 1,104 Bitcoin in the quarter despite the challenges posed by the recent Bitcoin halving.  However, the firm faced a net loss of $154 million due to reduced power credits, increased expenses, and halving impacts.  Riot’s energy efficiency, at 3.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, has helped it maintain a mining cost well below current market prices, supporting its overall resilience. While Bitcoin mining activities are doing well, countries like Russia are actively moving the opposite.  A recent report shows that the country caps private crypto mining electricity usage at 6,000kWh per month, and even some regions are still actively banning crypto mining operations.

South Korea’s Bitcoin Premium: Bullish Indicator or Local Market Trend? Bitcoin’s price in South Korea consistently trades higher than on international exchanges, with a recent premium of 2.21% recorded on October 24. While Bitcoin sits around $69,058 globally, South Korean exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb list it above $69,800. This price difference stems from high local demand and strict regulations, with the South Korean won ranking among the top currencies used in Bitcoin transactions. Such premiums often reflect bullish sentiment, suggesting confidence in Bitcoin’s continued rise. Key Points:  South Korean Bitcoin trades at a premium above global prices. High demand and local regulations fuel this price difference. Persistent premiums may signal strong demand and inspire global interest.

Busy Week Ahead for Markets with U.S. Election and Fed Rate Decision Major market movements are anticipated next week due to a Federal Reserve meeting and the U.S. election. On November 5, Americans will cast their votes for the next president, and markets are tense due to the close contest between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.  The latest spike in bitcoin (BTC) is attributed to Trump’s possible victory and prospects for crypto deregulation.  However, Harris’ victory might help clean energy equities, but it might also hurt “Trump trade” assets like Treasuries and the currency.

The scammers threatened arrest for missing jury duty, convincing the victim to send Bitcoin under the pretense of avoiding a warrant. “A deputy will never call to inform someone of an arrest warrant or request payment in Bitcoin, gift cards, or wire transfers to clear it,” the sheriff’s office stated in an incident report. Another Transaction Worth  $4,000 in Bitcoin Invertedin Colorado An additional $4,000 transaction was underway before deputies intervened, but the perpetrators had already accessed personal information during their initial contact. Similar scams are surfacing statewide, according to call logs. In one case, a Denver woman reportedly lost nearly $5,000 in Bitcoin after scammers impersonating Denver Police officers convinced her she had missed jury duty. Following the scammers’ instructions, she sent funds through a Bitcoin ATM. When she later contacted Denver Police to verify, she discovered she had been defrauded.   Beware of crypto scams! A #Colorado resident lost $6,000 in Bitcoin to scammers posing as law enforcement. Stay vigilant and protect your assets from fraud.#CryptoScam #Bitcoin #StaySafe pic.twitter.com/9H4JuZl4DD— Times of Blockchain (@ToBcryptonews) November 4, 2024  Authorities reported it’s unlikely her funds will be recovered, though her bank has been notified. The incident mirrors another recent attempt in Keystone where bank staff stopped a resident from transferring $8,000 in crypto after they received similar calls. Scammers are increasingly using caller ID spoofing to make it appear their calls are coming from official law enforcement agencies. Crypto fraud has surged across Colorado. State investigators documented over 1,300 crypto-related scams in 2023, resulting in losses exceeding $81 million. Colorado now ranks 15th nationally for crypto crimes, according to state data. In response to rising crypto scams, FBI Denver issued a public warning earlier this year highlighting cases where fraudsters targeted religious communities. In one incident, a pastor and his wife allegedly misappropriated around $3.2 million in crypto, promoting a token called INDXcoin to their Christian community. “These scammers can be aggressive and persuasive,” the Sheriff’s Office cautioned, adding that the irreversible nature of crypto transactions makes it particularly attractive to fraudsters. Once transferred, funds are difficult to trace or recover. DHS Investigators Prevent Hundreds of Ransomware Attacks As reported, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has disrupted hundreds of crypto scam incidents, reclaiming billions in extorted cryptocurrency since 2021. DHS investigators have intercepted 537 ransomware attacks before they could cause widespread damage. The effort, led by the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Cyber Crimes Center, has proven particularly vital for the protection of U.S. government agencies, which have been the primary targets of these cyber threats. Meanwhile, phishing attacks remain a major issue for crypto users, resulting in substantial losses. In September alone, more than 10,000 individuals lost over $46 million to such scams, as reported by Scam Sniffer, a Web3 anti-scam platform. The platform revealed that 10,805 victims suffered losses amounting to $46.7 million from various crypto phishing scams. In the third quarter of 2024, over $127 million in crypto assets were stolen, with Ether wallets being the prime targets in these phishing attacks.

Crypto News,Heather Morgan Seeks Sentence Served in Bitfinex Bitcoin Laundering Case,"Mon, 04 Nov 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/heather-morgan-seeks-time-served-in-bitfinex-bitcoin-laundering-case/,Heather Morgan is requesting to avoid further prison time as she awaits sentencing for her involvement in laundering Bitcoin stolen from Bitfinex.The postHeather Morgan Seeks Sentence Served in Bitfinex Bitcoin Laundering Caseappeared first onCryptonews.," Heather Morgan, also known by her rapper alias “Razzlekhan,” is requesting to avoid further prison time as she awaits sentencing for her involvement in laundering Bitcoin stolen from the crypto exchange Bitfinex by her husband, Ilya Lichtenstein. Morgan’s legal team filed an appeal on October 31 in a Washington, D.C. federal court, urging the judge to consider a sentence of “time served.” Morgan’s attorneys pointed out that she endured challenging conditions during her brief pretrial detention, including recovery from surgery and contracting COVID-19. Morgan Adhered to Her Pretrial Supervision Terms Following her release in February 2022, they claim Morgan has fully adhered to the strict terms of her pretrial supervision. In August 2023, she pleaded guilty to charges of money laundering and fraud related to the laundering of 120,000 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $8.2 billion, stolen from Bitfinex. These charges carry a potential maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. In recent developments, U.S. prosecutors have recommended a comparatively light sentence of 18 months for Morgan, citing her “substantial assistance” to the investigation. Prosecutors also acknowledged that her role was minor relative to Lichtenstein’s and that she only accessed a fraction of the stolen funds. According to their statement, Morgan was “thrust into the middle of a serious criminal scheme without her initial consent,” suggesting that her participation was likely motivated by loyalty to her husband. Morgan’s legal counsel argued that she was unaware of her husband’s involvement in the Bitfinex hack until more than three years after the crime. They maintain that Morgan “did not plan or seek out the offense” and express her “deep remorse” for her actions. Her lawyers also said that she has taken steps to distance herself from her rap persona, Razzlekhan. Her legal team described the Razzlekhan persona as a “caricature” distinct from her true character, noting Morgan’s growth and maturity. The plea deal detailed that Lichtenstein admitted to stealing the 120,000 Bitcoin and enlisting Morgan to help conceal the funds. He reportedly moved around 25,000 Bitcoin through crypto mixers and privacy services in an attempt to cover his tracks. Prosecutors Ask Five-Year Sentence for Lichtenstein Last month, U.S. prosecutors recommended a five-year sentence for Lichtenstein, reduced from a potential 20 years due to his cooperation, which they stated has been valuable to ongoing investigations. Prosecutors argue, however, that Lichtenstein should face a longer sentence than Morgan, given his central role in the heist and his previous experimentation with a separate $200,000 crypto theft. Morgan’s sentencing is set for November 15, with Lichtenstein’s hearing scheduled a day earlier on November 14. Amazon’s production arm is currently in the works to produce a film titled “Razzlekhan,” inspired by the couple’s actions. The screenplay is influenced by a 2022 New York Times article that outlined the duo’s involvement in laundering proceeds from the Bitfinex hack.

Per News1, the Virtual Assets Committee will convene for the first time on November 6, with crypto ETFs high on the agenda. South Korean Crypto Community Left Out in the Cold? The body, which answers to the Financial Services Commission (FSC), will also debate allowing South Korean firms to use their balance sheets to buy BTC, Ethereum (ETH), and other tokens. The body will also discuss new stablecoin regulations as Seoul looks for new ways to police the industry.  However, in a blow to the crypto sector, the new regulator will not comprise any industry professionals. The FSC has reportedly “excluded” crypto company executives due to “possible conflicts of interest.” Instead, the FSC will draw its nine “civilian” members from leading think tanks and universities. The media outlet explained that “no one from the virtual asset industry has been included in the civilian committee.” This means that none of the five crypto exchanges in the Digital Asset Exchange Association (DAXA) will take a seat on the committee.  South Korea is mulling banning smartphones in schools, as the government weighs in on a bill proposed by the ruling party that would prohibit students from using personal digital devices during class.https://t.co/ziF5VWYcfw— The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) November 3, 2024  FSC Turns to Think Tanks The FSC appears to have told media outlets that it has instead recruited people who have “conducted research on virtual assets” at think tanks like the Capital Market Research Institute and the Financial Research Institute.  “We have made it a rule to exclude the industry from the new committee. We have tried to form a committee of experts.” FSC Chairman Kim Byung-hwan A graph showing trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past week, (Source: CoinGecko) The body’s meeting means that the debate on Bitcoin spot ETFs is finally “expected to gain speed.” The FSC has repeatedly delayed deliberation on crypto ETFs this year, despite multiple approvals in the US and elsewhere. The body had been slated to meet for the first time in September. However, the FSC postponed the launch “due to delays in the selection” of the civilian members. Stablecoin Regulations on the Way? FSC Chairman Kim Byung-hwan confirmed the body would tackle “issues” such as the approval or otherwise of corporate crypto accounts.” He said it would also create a new “stablecoin regulatory system.” Kim conceded that the issue of whether South Korean firms can hold crypto was “being talked about a lot nowadays.”  Kim Byoung-hwan, chief of the Financial Services Commission, said on Wednesday that achievements of the Corporate Value-up Program should be evaluated over the long term amid growing disappointment in the government-led initiative. (Korea Times) https://t.co/kqZZYZdzU0— Financial Services Commission – FSC Korea (@FSC_Korea) October 30, 2024  South Korean business owners have told Cryptonews.com that they believe they should be free to invest in crypto using their balance sheets “if [they] want to.” Others claim South Korea risks being “left behind” as rival firms in the United States and Japan step up their own BTC, ETH, and altcoin investment programs.

On Nov. 4, Marathon Digital announced that it boosted its Bitcoin production by 2% to 717 BTC in October, marking its strongest monthly production since the halving event that cut mining rewards by half. The firm stated that it achieved this milestone despite a minor decline in block wins due to heightened network difficulty. Marathon’s Bitcoin production Marathon’s Chairman and CEO Fred Thiel explained that higher transaction fees in October boosted the firm’s BTC production, which accounted for around 5% of the total BTC mined. According to Thiel, two large transactions alone generated fees of 3.217 BTC and 2.665 BTC, showcasing the potential of Marathon’s proprietary mining technology to capture additional revenue. Thiel stated: “We believe that our proprietary technology platforms such as Slipstream and MARAPool, our proprietary mining pool, allow us to capture all potential benefits and take advantage of higher transaction fees as they arise.” Meanwhile, Marathon’s active hashrate climbed to 40.2 exahashes per second (EH/s), a 14% increase from September. Thiel noted that this number showed that the company remains on track to reach its 50 EH/s target by year-end by installing new miners, infrastructure upgrades, and energizing additional immersion containers. As of Oct. 31, Marathon held 27,562 BTC, including 4,499 restricted coins, and maintained an average daily production of 23.1 BTC throughout the month. Riot sees a 23% increase Similarly, Riot Platforms reported producing 505 BTC in October, marking a 23% increase from September’s 412 BTC and setting a new post-halving record. The company’s daily production also rose from 13.7 BTC in September to 16.8 BTC in October. Riot CEO Jason Les attributed the production increase to gains in hashrate deployment and operational efficiency. Riot’s hashrate rose to 29.4 EH/s in October, up from 28.2 EH/s in the previous month, driven by the deployment of new MicroBT miners at the Corsicana facility. By the end of October, Riot’s Bitcoin holdings rose to 10,928 BTC, up from 10,427 BTC in September.

This was corroborated by data from Coinglass, which stated: “Some longs and shorts chose to close their positions before the US election.” Bitcoin Open Interest (Source: Coinglass) The dip suggests investors are cautious amid increased risk aversion across the market.

As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $67,731, according to CryptoSlate data. Singapore-based trading firm QCP suggests this might be a temporary lull before a breakout, potentially pushing Bitcoin toward new highs. Activity in the options market supports this view, with notable interest in “topside” positions and increased purchases of $75,000 call options set to expire at the end of November. QCP predicts that Bitcoin’s price will likely remain within its current range until post-election clarity emerges. The firm also suggests that a Donald Trump victory could trigger an immediate price surge, while a Kamala Harris win might have the opposite effect.

According to the latest weekly report by Bitfinex, while Bitcoin’s implied volatility is currently muted, the research expected a potential spike in activity following election day with a potential Republican victory favorable for Bitcoin. “Calm Before the Storm” Under current market conditions, Bitfinex Alpha observed that while Bitcoin’s price has seen a spike followed by fluctuations, its implied volatility continues to be restrained. Based on the report, the subdued volatility, especially in the options markets, suggests investors are cautious ahead of the U.S. presidential election. The analysis noted that recent “Trump Trade” speculation, spurred by fluctuating odds in favor of a Republican victory, had briefly driven Bitcoin’s price upward. However, the ongoing election uncertainty has tempered that movement. Bitcoin dominance has reached over 60% in the altcoin sector, signaling a cycle high. According to Bitfinex, this dominance has led to altcoins experiencing greater sensitivity to Bitcoin’s price movements, with notable pullbacks seen in Ethereum and Solana.

Crypto News,Musicians Explain How the Bitcoin Blockchain Can Fix the Music Industry,"Mon, 04 Nov 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/musicians-explain-how-the-bitcoin-blockchain-can-fix-the-music-industry/,"Musicians are exploring Bitcoin's blockchain to address industry challenges, offering transparent, immutable ownership and rights protection. With tools like Ordinals and Audionals, artists reclaim control over their work and revenue in a decentralized framework.The postMusicians Explain How the Bitcoin Blockchain Can Fix the Music Industryappeared first onCryptonews."," The music industry, a multi-billion-dollar market, has seen rapid growth in digital streaming on platforms like Spotify.  However, streaming platforms often overlook musicians’ interests, according to recent reports, leaving artists to receive minimal compensation in return for their music.  Source: Pandora Cloudcover Recent statistics show that musicians earn only pennies per stream on platforms like Apple Music and Spotify. A Musician Challenged by the Traditional Music Industry Italian singer-songwriter and actress Violetta Zironi has experienced the struggles of streaming platforms firsthand.  Zironi shared with Cryptonews that music today suffers from hyperinflation due to platforms like Spotify.  “These platforms have commoditized and devalued music to virtually nothing, creating monopolies that control artists,” she said. The challenges with streaming platforms led Zironi to reconsider her music career altogether.  “I was at a crossroads in my career after eight years in the traditional music industry and was considering stepping away from music,” Zironi said. “During the pandemic, traditional streaming platforms weren’t serving my artistic or community-building goals, and live performances were impossible.” Encouraged by her mother, Zironi began exploring non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as an alternative to traditional streaming.  NFTs have become popular among musicians for allowing them to earn more in royalties while gaining control over their data and musical rights.  “When my mother mentioned NFTs and peer-to-peer art collections, something clicked,” Zironi shared. “I left traditional channels behind to explore this space exclusively, and I haven’t looked back.” Bitcoin Ordinals and New Opportunities for Musicians For nearly three years, Zironi has been releasing her music on the blockchain, with the rise of Bitcoin music inscriptions through Ordinals providing even more possibilities.  “This ensures my work is preserved forever on the most robust, decentralized ledger, tied to Bitcoin’s permanence,” Zironi mentioned. Bitcoin’s blockchain has not only preserved Zironi’s music but has also opened new revenue streams.  Recently, Zironi auctioned her latest song, “n0 0rdinary kind,” for 1 Bitcoin (BTC), marking the 34th largest inscription on Bitcoin.  1 song… 1 BTCWhen it happened earlier I didn’t quite realize right away what that really meant Despite knowing every inch of relentless work I put in for 3 years to get to this moment, it still didn’t feel real until…I sat down at my childhood piano and, fighting the… pic.twitter.com/rhYD56v83L— Violetta Zironi  (@ZironiVioletta) October 3, 2024  With the maturation of Bitcoin Ordinals, more musicians are inscribing their music on Bitcoin’s blockchain.  Former music producer Jim Crane noted that blockchain technology is becoming increasingly popular for enabling artists to reclaim control over their creative output and revenue streams.  “Blockchain offers transparent tracking of how music is used and monetized, which helps in building trust between artists and consumers,” Crane said. Inscribing Music On-Chain According to Crane, Bitcoin music inscriptions offer significant benefits, including immutable attribution and ownership.  “The blockchain provides a permanent and tamper-proof record of who created, collaborated or contributed, in any way, to a piece of music, ensuring that artists receive proper credit and can prove ownership unequivocally,” he explained. In 2023, Crane developed a protocol called “Audionals” to streamline music inscription on Bitcoin and minimize intermediaries in the industry.   The audionals are coming…Audionals are a #Bitcoin #ordinals standard for inscribing and recursively accessing and sequencing on-chain audio files. The web3 music revolution begins here! pic.twitter.com/m6C5TgVJCK— Jim.btc (@jimdotbtc) June 25, 2023  This protocol supports recursive use of inscribed audio on-chain, similar to a digital audio workstation but within a decentralized environment.  “This protocol allows for the recursive use of inscribed audio on-chain, similar to how a traditional digital audio workstation (DAW) operates, but within a decentralized environment,” Crane added. Solving Block Space Limitations Despite the advantages of Bitcoin music inscriptions, challenges remain, particularly around limited block space.  Shailee Adinolfi, Business Development Lead for Leather, told Cryptonews that Ordinal inscriptions involve inscribing metadata onto a satoshi (the smallest unit of Bitcoin), with each satoshi capable of holding up to 4MB of data.  “This could cause real demand when multiple artists are looking to launch songs, albums, or collections,” Adinolfi said. Zironi noted that she encountered block space limitations when attempting to inscribe a full song with visual artwork.  “Block space on Bitcoin is limited to 4MB, and high-quality inscriptions are costly, so I worked within 600KB to make it feasible,” she explained. “However, this limitation became a blessing in disguise: for the first time, I could showcase an authentic, unpolished vocal and guitar performance without industry pressure to overproduce.” Adinolfi added that recursive inscriptions, introduced after Ordinals, enable developers to pull data from existing files, conserving block space instead of uploading new features with each inscription.  “The solution for musicians may come from Bitcoin scaling to layer-2 (L2) solutions, allowing artists to create on-chain with lower fees,” she said. Crane further explained how Audionals addresses block space constraints by inscribing small text files with instructions for recreating music on-chain, making the process far more efficient in terms of block space and costs.  Audional recursive songs, played directly from the Bitcoin Blockchain look and sound great on mobile!Have a look/listen on your phone:https://t.co/i6GAxJcZTC pic.twitter.com/Wr0y2cxuI1— @audionals (@audionals) September 5, 2024  “The first Audional Song, ‘Truth,’ uses studio-quality audio samples and represents the audio equivalent of a 70MB WAV recording,” he said. “By creating it recursively and reusing the same samples, we can drastically reduce the information size needed to play the song – without any compression or reprocessing of the audio.” Crane noted that the Audional version of “Truth” initially required about 100KB with the first sequencer version, but through further optimization, he reduced it to 30KB by serializing the inscribed data.  “Currently, I have further reduced the total size of a 12-minute song file created with the Audional Sequencer to approximately 3KB,” he said. “This has brought the on-chain studio master cost down from thousands of dollars to just a few dollars.” Bitcoin’s Role in the Future of Digital Music Although musical inscriptions on Bitcoin remain a new concept, Zironi believes this model will gain traction.  “The demand for a decentralized system that serves musicians and music enthusiasts is immense,” she shared. “Over the past year, I’ve inscribed four other songs on Bitcoin, and people are already asking to collect them.” Crane envisions that Audionals will contribute to a decentralized music ecosystem, making blockchain music creation more accessible to artists across various backgrounds and skills.  However, he pointed out that the industry must still establish standards to ensure interoperability and broader adoption.  “We still need the standardization of protocols,” he remarked. “This means establishing common standards for music on the blockchain to ensure interoperability and widespread adoption.” The post Musicians Explain How the Bitcoin Blockchain Can Fix the Music Industry appeared first on Cryptonews.

While Lee expects a broader market rally across sectors, Bernstein highlighted Bitcoin’s (BTC) resilience amid political uncertainty. Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat, recently shared his views on CNBC, stating that favorable economic fundamentals and a dovish Federal Reserve position make a strong case for a year-end rally. According to Lee, sidelined cash could flow back into the market as election-related uncertainty clears up. He said: “I’m bullish only in the sense that election uncertainty has caused people to derisk and cash to sit on the sidelines, but the fundamentals have been good.” Lee referenced strong earnings reports and Fed support as strong drivers once the uncertainty around elections subsides. He believes that even with a divided or unified government, markets could perform well through the end of 2024 and beyond. Bitcoin to withstand political shifts Lee’s comments come alongside Bernstein’s outlook on Bitcoin, which they say remains poised to withstand political shifts. In a note released on Nov. 4, Bernstein analysts highlighted Bitcoin’s structural drivers, including US fiscal policy, record debt levels, and increased demand for hard assets, as factors supporting its long-term growth. According to Bernstein, “Bitcoin remains the most resilient within crypto,” and its limited market share compared to global fiscal assets leaves ample room for growth. The firm has set a price target of $200,000 for Bitcoin by 2025, anticipating the digital asset’s appeal in an environment of fiscal indiscipline and monetary expansion. Bernstein analysts also noted that Bitcoin’s recent ETF adoption — bringing in over $23 billion in year-to-date inflows — may add to its momentum, regardless of who wins the presidency. They see a potential initial price response depending on the election outcome, with a Trump victory possibly pushing Bitcoin toward new highs of $80,000 to $90,000, while a Harris win could initially lead to a dip near $50,000. The analysts emphasized that Trump’s perceived pro-crypto stance contrasts with Harris’s reportedly hawkish position.

Bitcoin Magazine,"Satoshi Nakamoto: The Robin Hood of the Digital Age, But He Stole from Himself","Thu, 07 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/satoshi-nakamoto-the-robin-hood-of-the-digital-age-but-he-stole-from-himself,"In this modern-day Robin Hood tale, Satoshi Nakamoto didn’t rob the rich—he stole from himself. Discover how Bitcoin’s mysterious creator rewrote the rules of wealth redistribution without the tights or the crossbow, and gave power back to the people.","     Follow Mark on X.  Now, let’s talk about Robin Hood, shall we? You know, the dashing lad in tights who gallivanted around Sherwood Forest, robbing the rich to feed the poor? Great story, that. But if you think about it, Robin Hood’s modus operandi was a bit outdated. I mean, why steal from the rich when you can just build your own magical currency and make the rich irrelevant? Enter: Satoshi Nakamoto, the digital age’s answer to Robin Hood… without all the uncomfortable wardrobe choices.Now, for those of you unfamiliar with Satoshi, he (or she, or they, or possibly your nan—who knows?) is the mysterious creator of Bitcoin. And instead of sticking it to the man by looting gold-filled wagons, Satoshi played the long game: they built a brand-new financial system. A decentralized, peer-to-peer one that doesn’t rely on any one bank, government, or stocky sheriff demanding his cut. How’s that for a 21st-century upgrade?Here’s the best bit: Satoshi didn’t steal from the rich. Oh no. Too predictable. Too cliché. Instead, Satoshi “stole” from themselves. You see, they could have stuck around to be hailed as the genius creator of Bitcoin—maybe even gotten a cameo on some Netflix documentary, complete with dramatic music and close-ups of keyboard clicks. But they didn’t. Like a modern-day hero with absolutely zero interest in a knighthood (or any “hood,” for that matter), Satoshi just disappeared. Left behind the keys to a financial revolution and ghosted us all faster than someone with bad Wi-Fi on a Zoom call.And what’s even funnier? The 1.1 million Bitcoin Satoshi mined in the early days are still sitting there. Unmoved. Untouched. Satoshi didn’t even cash out like some reality show contestant after winning a lifetime supply of anonymity. Nope. They just let the fortune pile up like it’s the world’s biggest “Take a penny, leave a penny” jar. Talk about self-control—though, if we’re honest, it’s the ultimate form of trolling, isn’t it? “Here’s a gazillion dollars. But you can’t have it, and neither can I. Ha!”Now, let’s talk about the Robin Hood parallels. Robin Hood, bless his heart, had the best of intentions, didn’t he? Steal from the bloated, greedy rich, give to the needy poor. What a guy. But have you ever tried stealing from the rich? They’re quite good at hanging onto their stuff—whole legal teams dedicated to it, in fact. So instead of playing that game, Satoshi created a system where everyone could participate—rich, poor, and that guy down the street who always tries to sell you “vintage” VHS tapes. And no one’s the wiser who Satoshi even is. The ultimate “one for all, and all for one” scenario, without the faff of crossbows and merry men.And that’s where Bitcoin comes in. It’s like Robin Hood’s treasure chest, but with a lot less horseback riding and far more math. Instead of relying on central banks to tell you what you can and can’t do with your own money (cheeky, aren’t they?), Bitcoin puts power back in your hands. You don’t need permission. You don’t need a bank account. Heck, you don’t even need to wear green tights. (Though if you want to wear green tights, go ahead—I’m not here to judge. Much.)So, while Robin Hood was running around with a bow and arrow, Satoshi gave us all a digital sword. Sure, it’s invisible and runs on blockchain technology rather than actual pointy bits, but it slices through the nonsense of financial gatekeepers just the same. Want to send money to a mate across the globe without paying a middleman? Done. Want to opt out of a system where rich people get richer and the rest of us just watch? Here’s your ticket.But the pièce de résistance, the true work of genius here? Satoshi didn’t wait around for applause. No book tours, no TED Talks, no Vanity Fair spreads. Just dropped the mic (or laptop, as it were) and disappeared into the digital night like the true anonymous legend they are. Satoshi is the Robin Hood we deserve—and perhaps the one we didn’t even know we needed. The hero who built a financial revolution, didn’t take a single penny for themselves, and vanished.It’s the kind of modern-day Robin Hood story that makes you think: Why steal from the rich when you can steal from yourself—and give everyone a shot at the loot?Well played, Satoshi. Well played.This article is a Take. Opinions expressed are entirely the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine."
Bitcoin Magazine,Pro-Bitcoin Donald Trump Becomes the 47th President of the United States ,"Wed, 06 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/pro-bitcoin-donald-trump-becomes-the-47th-president-of-the-united-states-,"Bitcoin Magazine Reports from Las Vegas, real-time election results powered by Stand with Crypto","Donald J. Trump has officially emerged victorious, claiming the presidency for a second time as the 47th President of the United States. With a critical victory in Pennsylvania and a decisive win in Wisconsin, Trump clinched the presidency by surpassing the 270 electoral votes needed to secure his return to the White House. These key battleground states, which were closely contested throughout the campaign, proved pivotal in pushing Trump over the threshold, solidifying his victory.Trump’s final electoral tally reflects significant support across much of the Midwest and South, with additional wins in states such as Ohio and Florida reinforcing his lead. Vice President Kamala Harris, despite strong performances in traditional Democratic strongholds like California and New York, fell short as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin tipped in favor of Trump, marking the turning point in the race. Trump also garnered a majority of the popular vote, with over 51% (66.7 million votes), signaling a renewed mandate from voters who prioritized his economic policies and focus on deregulation.A Milestone for Bitcoin in the White HouseThis election victory also marks the historic inauguration of the first openly pro-Bitcoin president in the United States. During his campaign, Trump included a stop at Bitcoin 2024 in Nashville where he embraced several key promises aimed at Bitcoiners and the broader crypto community, which distinguished him from previous candidates and resonated strongly with advocates of decentralized finance. His stance on Bitcoin showcased an alignment with the values of financial freedom and sovereignty that underpin the broader crypto community. By pledging to protect Bitcoin miners, explore the possibility of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, and even vow to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht, Trump attracted considerable support from the Bitcoin and crypto voter demographic.Trump’s promises have not only inspired optimism among Bitcoiners but also highlighted a potential shift in the government’s approach to cryptocurrency. During his campaign, Trump criticized CBDCs as an encroachment on personal financial freedom, signaling his wariness of state-controlled digital currencies. This stance, which aligns with concerns in the Bitcoin community about financial privacy and state overreach, has helped position Trump as a potential ally in the fight against excessive financial control.Promises to Bitcoiners and the Crypto CommunityAmong Trump’s most notable commitments to Bitcoiners are several promises that represent a radical departure from previous administrations’ approach to cryptocurrency:Support for Bitcoin Miners in America: Trump has pledged to protect the burgeoning Bitcoin mining industry within the United States. His commitment to deregulation and support for energy independence aligns with the interests of miners, many of whom rely on stable energy policies and a supportive regulatory environment. This focus could help secure the U.S.’s position as a global leader in Bitcoin mining, fostering economic growth and innovation in blockchain technology.Bitcoin Strategic Reserve: In a move that would be unprecedented for a sitting president, Trump’s campaign discussed the idea of establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Such a reserve could provide a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, aligning with Bitcoin’s core appeal as “digital gold.” By backing this initiative, Trump has shown an openness to treating Bitcoin as a legitimate asset within the national financial framework.Pardon for Ross Ulbricht: Trump’s promise to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road who is serving a double life sentence, struck a chord within the Bitcoin community. Ulbricht’s imprisonment has long been viewed by many Bitcoiners as a case of excessive punishment, and Trump’s willingness to revisit the issue has further cemented his image as a candidate who values justice reform and personal freedom.Opposition to Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): Trump’s campaign included strong opposition to the creation of a Federal Reserve-controlled CBDC, citing concerns about government overreach and loss of individual financial autonomy. Many in the Bitcoin community see CBDCs as antithetical to the principles of decentralized finance. Trump’s alignment with this viewpoint has bolstered his appeal among Bitcoiners who prioritize privacy and freedom from state-controlled monetary systems.Simplified Tax Code for Digital Assets: While not explicitly part of his campaign, Trump’s emphasis on simplifying tax codes has led many Bitcoiners to speculate that his administration could enact policies to make digital asset taxation less burdensome. By easing the tax reporting process for cryptocurrency holders, Trump’s administration could foster greater adoption and legal clarity for investors.As Bitcoin adoption is on the rise, Trump’s presidency could mark a pivotal moment for Bitcoin in America. The growing alliance between Bitcoin’s ideals of decentralization and Trump’s policies on economic freedom suggest a promising road for Bitcoin under the next administration. "
Bitcoin Magazine,Trump’s Coin Is About As Revolutionary As OneCoin,"Tue, 05 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/trumps-coin-is-about-as-revolutionary-as-onecoin,I don’t think Donald Trump actually changed his mind on cryptocurrency much at all since three years ago… I think he just wants in on the scam.,"     Follow Aaron on Nostr or X.  After these classy gold sneakers and his God Bless the USA Bible, Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency World Liberty Financial (WLFI) immediately appeared to me like yet another way to squeeze some more money out of his fanbase. But when YouTuber Coffeezilla analyzed the project in more detail, what he found was even more ridiculous than what I was expecting.For starters (though unsurprisingly), WLFI is completely pre-mined. 20 billion coins, which represent 35% of the total supply, are being sold for $0.015 each. The other 65% of coins is allocated to protocol development and insiders.This means they value the WLFI project around $900 million, immediately bringing it into the same ballpark as something like Bitcoin SV (perhaps fittingly). In reality, however, less than 1 billion coins have been sold so far, making it closer to a $14 million market cap coin, more similar to projects like Pikaboss or Boba Oppa— I’d never heard of them either.It’s equally unsurprising that WLFI doesn’t accomplish anything new or interesting (lending and borrowing on the existing Aave protocol), or that it's not decentralized in any meaningful way, or that one of the project’s cofounders has a dodgy history in this space already.But what even I didn’t expect, is that WLFI is indefinitely non-transferable. That’s right, for the time being, at least, you can’t send these coins to anyone. You can just buy them, and, I guess, sell them back later? Maybe? This sounds more like OneCoin — the notorious fraud that was a cryptocurrency in name only — than any serious altcoin I’ve ever heard of.While Nikolaus and Calli believe the former president truly embraced Bitcoin, I don’t think he actually changed his mind on cryptocurrency much at all since three years ago… I think he just wants in on the scam.Watch the full Coffeezilla episode here:This article is a Take.

In its third-quarter earnings report released on Nov. 7, Galaxy announced a preliminary agreement with an undisclosed US hyperscaler—a large data center operator—to potentially convert its 800-megawatt (MW) Helios mining facility in West Texas for high-performance computing (HPC). Hyperscalers offer immense computing capacity to support demanding applications like AI. Currently, the Helios facility has 200 MW in operation, and Galaxy is investigating the feasibility of securing an additional 1.7 gigawatts (GW) of power capacity for the site. However, moving forward with this AI-focused plan will depend on thorough due diligence and necessary approvals. Other major mining companies, like Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital, are also considering AI expansions. Core Scientific, another prominent miner, is poised to generate over $8 billion through a 12-year partnership with AI-focused hyperscaler CoreWeave. This strategy follows predictions by industry analysts that Bitcoin miners who embrace AI could unlock new revenue streams. Asset management firm VanEck projects that Bitcoin miners could see up to $14 billion in annual profits by 2027 if they devote 20% of their energy resources to AI computations. Q3 results Galaxy’s third-quarter results further underscore the challenges facing Bitcoin miners. The firm reported a 27% drop in Bitcoin production, mining only 176 BTC during the third quarter, while revenue from mining declined 23% to $18.5 million. This downturn came despite an 11% increase in Galaxy’s hashrate, which rose to 6.2 exahashes per second (EH/s). Galaxy attributed these results to April’s Bitcoin halving event, the heightened mining difficulty, and seasonal curtailment of energy use. Overall, Galaxy reported a net loss of $54 million for the quarter, though this marked an improvement from the prior quarter’s net loss of $177 million. The company saw over 30% growth in operating revenue quarter-over-quarter despite industry-wide declines in trading volumes and a drop in Ethereum prices. Galaxy added that it recorded a net income of $191 million primarily due to strong operations and favorable market conditions for digital assets. As of Sept. 30, Galaxy’s equity capital stood at $2.1 billion. Meanwhile, Galaxy remains on track with its reorganization plans to become a Delaware-based corporation listed on the Nasdaq, pending final SEC review and necessary approvals.

BlackRock’s Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) holds 367,805 BTC, worth roughly $21.5 billion, with roughly $1.8 billion in unrealized profit as of Sept. 30. Additionally, since its inception, the IBIT has only sold 0.28% of its Bitcoin stash to cover share redemption, indicating high investor retention. As a result, the fund ended the third quarter with 366,448 BTC under management. Shares growing The filing highlighted that the NAV growth is mainly related to a 19.8% increase in outstanding shares, rising from 539.1 million to 644 million between quarters. Outstanding shares are owned by investors and are available for trading in the secondary market. IBIT’s liabilities are nearly $4 million, which is related to the ETF’s sponsor fees. Besides that, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has not registered any expenses since January. Notably, BlackRock registered over $1.6 million in realized profit by selling BTC since its inception to cover its expenses related to sponsor fees and redeeming investors’ shares. Daily records IBIT registered two daily records on Nov. 6 after hitting $1 billion in daily trading volume within 20 minutes of the trading session.  Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted that IBIT closed the day with $4.1 billion in trading volume, its highest since launch. However, IBIT registered its worst daily outflow on the same day, as $69.1 million left the fund. Balchunas added: “For context that’s more volume than stocks like Berkshire, Netflix or Visa saw today. It was also up 10%, its second best day since launching.” Additionally, the US-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $6 billion in volume, a collective record. Nevertheless, considering last week’s massive inflows, the outflows seen this week are not a cause for concern, as highlighted by a recent Glassnode report.

He contends that Bitcoin represents a strategic tool for national defense by using physical power to secure cyberspace, emphasizing its significance beyond a mere financial asset. Lowery shared the diagram below in 2021 to highlight how Bitcoin can replace the current system, which he describes as “the chain of custody for [land, gold, oil, and equities] is written in blood.” He further stated, “Not having to waste human life to defend monetized wealth is worth every watt.” Bitcoin reduces the cost of human life (Source: Jason Lowery) He argues that Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work mechanism allows for cyber sovereignty by physically securing information and digital assets in a trustless, peer-to-peer manner. This approach parallels how nations secure land, sea, air, and space domains. He believes this aspect of Bitcoin is a revolutionary advancement in computer theory that is currently undervalued. Lowery criticizes the Department of Defense for its lack of initiative. He finds it unacceptable that the agency is not proactive enough in exploring the cybersecurity benefits of reusable Proof-of-Work networks like Bitcoin. He asserts that the United States should lead and actively fund related research in this area. He also highlights policymakers’ need for more precise guidance on distinguishing between Bitcoin and other blockchain technologies. According to Lowery, understanding these fundamental differences is crucial for forming effective strategies. Addressing the nation’s strategic reserves, Lowery believes that any planned Bitcoin holdings are insufficient. He suggests that once the concept of “Bitcoin equals bitpower” is recognized, it becomes evident that holding only a million units does not meet the country’s needs. To secure access to Bitcoin, Lowery recommends building a robust hashing industry, referred to as a “U.S. Hash Force.” He notes that while this initiative doesn’t need to be government-led, support from the government could help seed its development. Drawing a parallel to how the US Space Force supports commercial launch companies to ensure access to orbit, he suggests similar support could provide access to the Bitcoin ledger. In his thesis, Lowery describes Bitcoin as the most physically powerful and efficient power projection tool discovered by mankind. He characterizes it as a non-kinetic defense system that could usher in a peaceful power balance termed “Mutually Assured Preservation.” Bitcoin power projection (Source: Jason Lowery, Softwar) Lowery aims to shift the conversation and prompt actionable steps from policymakers and defense agencies by reframing Bitcoin as a strategic asset integral to national security.

Crypto News,Bitcoin Reaches New Highs Amid $130 Billion Trading Surge – Could $1 Million Be Next in 2024?,"Thu, 07 Nov 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-reaches-new-highs-amid-130-billion-trading-surge-could-1-million-be-next-in-2024/,Bitcoin hits new highs as trading volume soars to $130 billion. Explore the path to $1 million in 2024 and what this means for crypto enthusiasts and investors.The postBitcoin Reaches New Highs Amid $130 Billion Trading Surge – Could $1 Million Be Next in 2024?appeared first onCryptonews.," Bitcoin (BTC) has surged to a new all-time high of $76,658, fueled by a $130 billion spike in trading volume. This rally follows the Federal Reserve’s recent 25-basis-point rate cut, which has boosted investor sentiment amid economic uncertainty.  Additionally, Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential victory has reignited both retail and institutional interest in Bitcoin, with BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF reaching a record trading volume of $4.1 billion, underscoring the cryptocurrency’s growing appeal as a hedge asset.   BREAKING: FED CUTS INTEREST RATES BY 25 BASIS POINTS SENDING BITCOIN TO ANOTHER ALL TIME HIGH!What does this mean for you?► Find out here: https://t.co/QxsKhyX6YG#News #InterestRates #RateCuts #TheFed #Feds #FederalReserve #Bitcoin #BTC #Finance #Economy pic.twitter.com/ighJvNs68a— iTrustCapital (@iTrustCapital) November 7, 2024  Furthermore, the bullish trend was attributed to the U.S. Presidential election victory of Donald Trump, which has reignited both retail and institutional interest in BTC as a hedge asset. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF reported a record single-day trading volume of $4.1 billion, underscoring the strong demand from institutional investors. Bitcoin Surge Driven by Fed Rate Cuts and Institutional Demand Amid Economic Uncertainty On the US front, the Federal Reserve lowered its interest rates by 25 basis points, in line with market expectations. This follows a 50 basis point cut in September. The rate decision came just two days after Donald Trump won the US presidential election.  The market was expecting this rate cut, and the CME FedWatch Tool shows there is also a nearly 70% chance of another rate cut in December. This has created uncertainty for the US Dollar (USD), with some believing that the dollar’s rally could slow down if the Fed hints at more rate cuts.  BREAKING:*FEDERAL RESERVE CUTS FED FUNDS RATE BY 25BPS TO 4.75%$SPY pic.twitter.com/Pskm0TRqWc— Investing.com (@Investingcom) November 7, 2024  Therefore, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut, combined with the uncertainty around future cuts, has likely contributed to Bitcoin’s surge to an all-time high. As borrowing costs decrease and inflation concerns rise, investors may seek Bitcoin as an alternative store of value. Trump’s Election Victory Sparks Bitcoin Surge Amid Optimism for Crypto-Friendly Policies Moreover, Donald Trump’s election victory boosted Bitcoin prices, as investors saw his policies as favorable for cryptocurrencies.  Trump’s expected stance on deregulation and his more lenient approach to crypto regulations were key factors driving the surge in Bitcoin’s value.  Bitcoin hit new record highs as traders anticipated that a Trump presidency would support the growth of digital assets by avoiding heavy-handed government intervention.  Reminder: Today is the FED meeting where a 25 bps rate cut is anticipated.Following Trump's victory in the US presidential election, this could create a new wave of positivity in the investment space.$BTC will be pivotal, setting the tone for the entire crypto market,… pic.twitter.com/00y3Di9tvK— Denis (@CryptoDSLX) November 7, 2024  In addition, Trump’s focus on tax cuts and economic growth made investors hopeful that his policies would help innovation, including in the cryptocurrency world.  Bitcoin, seen as a safe investment during market changes, gained popularity as people thought his government would be more supportive of digital currencies.  This shift in confidence, along with general market optimism, helped push Bitcoin’s price to record highs, making it one of the big winners of Trump’s victory. Bitcoin Price Forecast; Technical Indicators Signals Uptrend Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a bullish breakout, pushing above the $73,610 pivot level and establishing a new support around $75,409.  The rally appears strong, with the price testing the 1.618 Fibonacci extension at $77,807, a significant resistance zone. If BTC maintains momentum, it could aim for the next resistance levels at $80,401 and $82,248.   On the downside, immediate support lies at $73,610, followed by $71,017. The RSI currently shows bullish sentiment above 70, indicating potential overbought conditions, yet the 50 EMA, around $71,442, reinforces the upward trend, suggesting bullish continuation.

Crypto News,Bitfinity Network Launches Cross-Chain Integration of Bitcoin Runes to Expand DeFi,"Thu, 07 Nov 2024",https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/bitcoin-defi-grows-with-bitfinity-networks-runes-integration/,"By bridging Bitcoin Runes to Ethereum and ICP, Bitfinity Network brings unique DeFi capabilities to Bitcoin assets. Leveraging Chain-Key Technology, the integration emphasizes decentralized security, expands liquidity, and connects with Cosmos, offering a secure alternative to custodial Bitcoin models.The postBitfinity Network Launches Cross-Chain Integration of Bitcoin Runes to Expand DeFiappeared first onCryptonews."," Bitfinity Network, an EVM Layer-2 protocol specializing in Bitcoin assets, recently introduced a dual bridge integration, connecting Bitcoin Runes tokens with Ethereum-based DeFi applications and the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) ecosystem.  Max Chamberlin, Co-Founder of Bitfinity Network, shared with Cryptonews the motivations and technical aspects behind Bitfinity’s Runes integration and cross-chain bridging efforts, shedding light on the network’s approach to Bitcoin-backed DeFi. Why Choose Runes? A New Standard for Bitcoin-Backed Tokens The decision to prioritize Runes, a Bitcoin token protocol created by Casey Rodarmor, demonstrates Bitfinity’s commitment to efficiency and scalability in Bitcoin transactions.  Chamberlin explained that although several Bitcoin token standards are available, Runes provides a more streamlined and cost-effective solution, standing out particularly in comparison to the BRC-20 standard. “Runes allow for simple transfers by moving a Bitcoin UTXO without the need for new inscriptions or multiple transactions, unlike BRC-20,” Chamberlin explained. “This design makes Runes transfers both cheaper and more streamlined, making them ideal for a fungible token solution.”  What are Runes, and how does it improve on the existing BRC-20 standard?In today's video, we explore Runes, how it works, and how it differs from BRC-20.Watch the full video: https://t.co/drn91TkIbs pic.twitter.com/F8Pr7M1Cb0— CoinGecko (@coingecko) September 2, 2024  Although BRC-20 has gained traction as one of the first standards in the Bitcoin token space, Chamberlin believes Runes is technically superior due to its efficiency.  Bitfinity’s support for Runes integration opens up diverse DeFi applications, bringing fungible tokens to Ethereum-compatible platforms and tapping into broader liquidity for Bitcoin-backed assets. Bitfinity Network: Ensuring Stability for High-Volume Trading To handle the market volatility of meme tokens such as DOGE (Runes), which often experience trading surges, Bitfinity’s architecture has been optimized for stability and high capacity.  Chamberlin noted that Bitfinity’s network infrastructure is built to handle both speed and capacity demands, boasting performance metrics competitive with high-throughput chains like Solana.  Next-gen, high throughput blockchains are having a moment @SolanaLabs CEO & cofounder @aeyakovenko recently sat down with @salxyz & @SolBeachBum on @UnlayeredPod to share his story and talk all things Solana.Tune inhttps://t.co/ZlqUfCklrX— Solana (@solana) March 7, 2024  “Our infrastructure can handle hundreds of transactions per second (TPS), with most transactions confirmed within seconds,” Chamberlin stated. “This places us among the most efficient platforms, making Bitfinity highly competitive and significantly faster than most other EVM Layer 2 solutions.” This robust infrastructure allows Bitfinity to support high trading volumes for meme tokens without compromising transaction reliability or speed. Enhanced Bridge Security with Chain-Key Technology Security is paramount for Bitfinity, especially in light of recent vulnerabilities in cross-chain bridges.  Bitfinity’s decision to adopt Internet Computer’s Chain-Key Technology marks a departure from custodial models like Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), opting for a fully decentralized and secure bridge infrastructure. “Since key exfiltration is the leading cause of bridge attacks, Chain-Key addresses this by splitting signing authority across 28+ independent signers,” Chamberlin noted. “This surpasses the typical 3-5 signers used in other Bitcoin-native multi-sig protocols, creating a high threshold of security that makes private key infiltration very difficult.” Chain-Key ensures no single point of failure in the bridge architecture by leveraging a threshold signature scheme.  $ICP is transforming Multi-Chain developments through CHAIN FUSION But WTF is Chain Fusion?Developed by @dfinity @ICPHubs (Must follow)This is where smart contracts operate across chains without bridges, and where #Web3 feels as smooth as Web2.It lets all major… pic.twitter.com/1bCjf8PxYu— CryptoBusy (@CryptoBusy) October 24, 2024  This cryptographic approach, validated in asynchronous settings, prevents vulnerabilities common in custodial bridges and traditional multi-sig models.  Unlike WBTC’s custodial model, Chain-Key is fully decentralized, reducing centralized attack risks and enhancing security for cross-chain transactions. Creating New DeFi Opportunities and Expanding Ecosystem Connectivity With Bitcoin’s $1.2 trillion market cap attracting growing interest from DeFi developers and institutional investors, Bitfinity’s dual bridge integration arrives at a pivotal time for the blockchain ecosystem.  As institutional interest grows, particularly with potential Bitcoin ETF approvals, a new wave of users may begin exploring decentralized, cross-chain Bitcoin opportunities. Bitfinity’s integration with Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) through Omnity Bridge extends Bitcoin’s reach by enabling Chain-key Bitcoin (ckBTC) to connect with ecosystems like Cosmos via the Osmosis DEX.  Chamberlin highlighted that the connection with Cosmos, a multi-chain ecosystem valued at $1.6 billion, creates unprecedented liquidity avenues, particularly for investors seeking a non-custodial, decentralized alternative to Wrapped Bitcoin.

The leading 2024 presale just secured $700,000 in two days, thanks in large part to another enormous whale assist, who recently scooped up $6 million in the project’s native token, $PEPU. With this quarter-of-$100 million milestone comes an exciting new development: a meme coin launchpad powered by the project’s L2 technology.  This launchpad is set to catapult Ethereum into the meme coin spotlight, eclipsing Solana’s dominance with Pump.fun. The future for $PEPU holders has never looked brighter, and investors can secure more $PEPU at just $0.01229 per token.  But hurry – there are fewer than 24 hours to buy at this price before the next funding round starts. The Trump trade worked its magic and now Bitcoin and meme coins are up “huge” Bitcoin says hello to a new all-time high of $76,460 on Thursday, as Trump secures his victory to become elected as the 47th president of the United States. Meme coins have soared, with their collective market value skyrocketing to $67 billion.  Leading the charge is Dogecoin ($DOGE), which recently caught the spotlight when Trump’s wealthiest supporter, Elon Musk, playfully referenced it as the acronym for the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) on the Joe Rogan podcast.  The token has sustained its upward momentum since Monday, rising by 13.93%. Other dog-themed coins also saw substantial gains, with Bonk ($BONK) rising 6.98% and CorgiAI ($CORGIAI) increasing by 24.8% over the same period. The latest batch of tokens emerging from the Pump.fun launchpad is also strutting their stuff.  MICHI ($MICHI) and Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT) have posted impressive gains of 15.24% and 33.29%, respectively. However, Moo Deng ($MOODENG) is the biggest mover, soaring 41% in just the past 24 hours.  Moo Deng Price: MOODENG Live Price Chart, Market Cap & News Today | CoinGecko Pump.fun has earned its reputation as the go-to platform for launching some of the most creative, meme-worthy assets in the crypto world, thanks to its user-friendly design. Even those without coding experience can dive in and create the next viral token. With meme coins primed for explosive growth, especially in 2025, platforms like Pump.fun fuel this rise, making it easier than ever for new projects to gain traction. And now, with Pepe Unchained celebrating its latest milestone, it’s stepping up with its own meme coin launchpad – one that can thrust Ethereum into the meme coin spotlight and level the playing field among the top chains. Pepe Unchained’s new innovation: Pepe’s Pump Pad Ethereum has long been seen as a chain bogged down by outdated limitations – clunky, slow, and often prohibitively expensive. For meme coin projects like Pepe ($PEPE) and PepeCoin ($PEPECOIN), being tied to Ethereum has hindered their growth and created a hassle for token holders.  For example, the cost of purchasing a single $PEPE token was often driven up by high gas fees, to the point where one Reddit user noted paying more in transaction costs than the actual value of the tokens they wanted to buy. Enter Pepe Unchained – a beacon of hope designed to break free from these Ethereum bottlenecks and make Pepe token ownership a whole lot easier. Its Ethereum L2 solution promises to end the days of costly, limited transactions for Pepe and potentially other meme coins. With the new L2 chain, users can now own Pepe tokens without being hampered by the old Ethereum restrictions. The project has even launched developer grants to test the full potential of this chain and encourage the brightest minds to build on its new technology. But the Pepe Unchained ecosystem is just getting started. The project has just unveiled Pepe’s Pump Pad, a meme coin launchpad similar to Pump.fun, designed to make Ethereum the epicenter of the meme coin world.  We're proud to announce a massive new upgrade to the Pepe Unchained Ecosystem.Pepe's Pump Pad Link to the new page on the website here: https://t.co/jz1v0iRppq pic.twitter.com/mBzC9wDnl9— Pepe Unchained (@pepe_unchained) November 6, 2024  Pepe Unchained’s L2 solution makes the platform ideal for the high-frequency, low-cost trading that meme coins demand. This ecosystem promotes broader participation and higher trading volumes – critical ingredients for the viral growth typical of the meme coin market. Furthermore, Ethereum’s established DeFi infrastructure ensures deep liquidity and seamless integration with Ethereum-native protocols.  And just like Pump.fun, Pepe’s Pump Pad makes it easy for anyone to create their own meme coin – no coding knowledge required. Users can instantly launch their meme coins with a simple two-click process on their website. Pepe Unchained sees two major whale buys in just one week As mentioned, the push to the $25 million milestone comes from another major whale buy. One whale scooped up 2.2 million $PEPU tokens for around $27,000 this month. Then, on Thursday, another crypto whale made an even bigger splash, purchasing 6 million $PEPU tokens for approximately $77,000.  Ethereum Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | Etherscan Whale purchases have become a growing trend for Pepe Unchained since September, with a few notable buys dating back to July. Whale buys are significant because they signal strong investor confidence, often from individuals or institutional investors with large crypto holdings. These whales not only have more capital but also bring valuable insights that go beyond the reach of the average investor. For smaller investors, these whale moves can be an opportunity to follow the smart money – especially when the asset is still available at a discount. Since $PEPU is currently in its presale phase, it represents a golden opportunity for investors to buy in at a fraction of its future value. Tier-1 exchanges have already expressed interest in Pepe Unchained.  If $PEPU secures a listing on a major exchange, such as Binance, its liquidity could greatly enhance due to increased investor access, potentially resulting in a massive price boost. A prime example is First Neiro on Ethereum ($NEIRO), which skyrocketed 862x following its listing on Binance. If $PEPU were to follow a similar trajectory, a mere $1,000 investment could potentially turn into a jaw-dropping $862 million. Given the current price of $PEPU, this is a chance no investor should overlook. Strap up for the next milestone at $26 million If you’re new to Pepe Unchained or aiming to acquire more $PEPU tokens to help the project reach its next milestone of $26 million, participating in the presale is straightforward. Head over to the project’s official website, connect your wallet, and purchase $PEPU with ETH, USDT, or BNB. Credit card payments are also an option. You can invest with peace of mind, as the project’s smart contract has been rigorously audited by Coinsult and SolidProof, ensuring no critical vulnerabilities were found in its code. For developers eager to build on the Pepe Unchained L2 chain, grant applications are now open. Complete a quick form on the website, and you’ll receive a confirmation email. The Pepe Council will review submissions on an ongoing basis and award grants to promising projects.

Bitcoin Magazine,Half Way Through The 4 Year Bitcoin Cycle,"Fri, 08 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/half-way-through-the-4-year-bitcoin-cycle,Bitcoin’s Four-Year Rhythm: Mid-Cycle Insights and What Investors Should Expect,"Bitcoin has historically followed a familiar four-year cycle. Now, two years into the current cycle, investors are closely watching patterns and market indicators for insights into what the next two years may hold. This article dives into the anatomy of Bitcoin’s four-year cycle, past market behavior, and future possibilities.The 4 Year CycleBitcoin’s four-year cycle is partly influenced by the scheduled halving events, which reduce the block reward miners receive by 50% every four years. This halving decreases the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, often creating supply-demand pressures that can push prices higher.This can be clearly visualized by the Stock-to-Flow Model, which compares the existing BTC in circulation to its inflationary rate, and models a ‘fair-value’ based on comparable hard assets such as Gold and Silver.  Figure 1: Bitcoin halving impact visualized through the Stock-to-Flow Model.  Currently, we’re midway through this cycle, meaning we are potentially entering a period of exponential gains as the typical one year catch-up phase following the halving progresses.A Look Back at 2022Two years ago, Bitcoin faced a severe crash amid a series of corporate implosions. November 2022 marked the downfall of FTX, as rumors of insolvency triggered massive sell-offs. The domino effect was brutal, as other crypto institutions, such as BlockFi, 3AC, Celsius, and Voyager Digital, also went under.  Figure 2: Cryptocurrencies such as FTT, linked to FTX, collapsed nearly 100% in a few days.  Bitcoin’s price tumbled from around $20,000 to $15,000, mirroring the broader market panic and leaving investors worried about Bitcoin’s survival. However, true to form, Bitcoin rallied again, climbing back up fivefold from the 2022 lows. Investors who weathered the storm were rewarded, and this rebound supports the argument that Bitcoin’s cyclical nature remains intact.Similar SentimentIn addition to price patterns, investor sentiment also follows a predictable rhythm across each cycle. Analyzing the Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL), a metric showing unrealized gains and losses in the market, suggests that emotions like euphoria, fear, and capitulation repeat regularly. Bitcoin investors typically face intense feelings of fear or pessimism during each bear market, only to shift back toward optimism and euphoria as prices recover and rise. Currently, we’re once again entering the ‘Belief’ stage following our early cycle runup and subsequent consolidation.  Figure 3: NUPL indicating similar sentiment at the same stage in every cycle.  The Global Liquidity CycleThe global money supply and cyclical liquidity, as measured by Global M2 YoY vs BTC, has also followed a four-year cycle. For instance, M2 liquidity bottomed out in 2015 and 2018, just as Bitcoin hit lows. In 2022, M2 again hit a low point, perfectly aligning with Bitcoin’s bear market bottom. Following these periods of economic contraction, we see fiscal expansion across central banks and governments everywhere, which leads to more favorable conditions for Bitcoin price appreciation.  Figure 4: Global liquidity cycles aligning with BTC bull/bear markets.  Familiar PatternsHistorical price analysis suggests that Bitcoin’s current trajectory is strikingly similar to previous cycles. From its lows, Bitcoin usually takes around 24-26 months to break past previous highs. In the last cycle, it took 26 months; in this cycle, Bitcoin’s price is on a similar upward trajectory after 24 months. Bitcoin has historically peaked about 35 months after its lows. If this pattern holds, we may see significant price increases through October 2025, after which another bear market could set in.Following the anticipated peak, history suggests Bitcoin would enter a bear phase in 2026, lasting roughly one year until the next cycle begins anew. These patterns aren’t a guarantee but provide a roadmap that Bitcoin has adhered to in previous cycles. They offer a potential framework for investors to anticipate and adapt to the market.  Figure 5: Similar timeframes for new highs, cycle peaks, and lows over the previous cycles.  ConclusionDespite challenges, Bitcoin’s four-year cycle has endured, largely due to its supply schedule, global liquidity, and investor psychology. As such, the four-year cycle remains a valuable tool for investors to interpret potential price movements in Bitcoin and our base case for the rest of this cycle. However, relying solely on this cycle could be shortsighted. By incorporating on-chain metrics, liquidity analysis, and real-time investor sentiment, data-driven approaches can help investors respond effectively to changing conditions.For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out a recent YouTube video here: The 4 Year Bitcoin Cycle - Half Way Done?"

Bitcoin Magazine,Democrats Must Embrace Bitcoin To Survive,"Fri, 08 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/democrats-must-embrace-bitcoin-to-survive,"If the Democratic Party is to have a future in US politics, it must embrace Bitcoin going forward.","I, like many of you, am processing the results of the recent U.S. election in which Donald Trump won handily both the electoral college and popular vote. As pundits discuss, left mainstream media personalities mourn, and yes many Trump supporters cheer ecstatically, as a progressive Bitcoiner it’s entirely clear to me: If the Democratic Party wants a future in America, it must embrace Bitcoin. Let me explain what I mean. Not only do I think is it imperative for the party to embrace Bitcoin if it wants to survive, but after this decisive Trump victory, I think many within the party, and those independent voters who dip in and out of voting for democratic candidates, are looking to make a drastic change and go back to the drawing board. Bernie is back, and he has something to say. It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change.And they’re right. pic.twitter.com/lM2gSJmQFL— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) November 6, 2024  Now that Biden’s term is coming to a close, and Harris conceded the race in defeat, Bernie isn’t mincing words with his criticism of the democratic party and priorities. “It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.” Many within the party, and former Bernie supporters who perhaps are not in the party or supportive any longer, have been beating this drum for a while: Democrats favor coastal elites, who opine about progressive politics and “wokism” intellectually, while paying lip-service (and patronizing various other minority groups) to working class americans. After losing to Donald Trump twice, many democrats, progressives, and certainly independent and democratic american voters are wondering, where do we go from here? Trump is a tour de force. A charismatic figure that has truly altered the course of American politics in ways the GOP, strategists, journalists, and the political establishment never thought was possible. The democratic party has been struggling to come up with answers against Trump and MAGA populism after 2016. While mainstream media may continue to cast his victories as the product of racism, sexism, or other beliefs steeped in identity politics, the same they did in 2016, many within the party are accepting that the strategies around identity politics, anti-Trump, and some moral high ground are decisively ineffective. While we all will be analyzing data, voter profiles, trends, etc over the next several months, many journalists, including some quite influential progressive leaning media outlets including Pod Save America, Breaking Points, and beyond conceded that the Democratic Party must return to being the party of working people and focus on the economy and inflation, which was one of the most important issues for voters at the polls this year. The Democratic party period from 2016-present has focused heavily on identity politics, what many deem as “wokism” and more, which I wouldn’t discredit out right. Much of this is important. But, the weight and prioritization of these issues over economic and other hardships Americans face has been the issue. Many democrats and progressive knew this, but now we have data and election results to prove that it is not a winning strategy for the party, particularly in the presidential election. Being a progressive and Bitcoiner is quite a unique position to be in, and it’s helped me analyze the world and predict certain trends and outcomes in interesting ways that often times bitcoiners, or progressives outside of the bitcoin bubble, miss. In fact, I’m not alone. Many of the outspoken progressives and left-leaning folks in the bitcoin space were former Bernie bros, inspired by Occupy Wall Street and other populist economic messages around wealth inequality, corporate capture in America, Big Bank bailouts and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. Many of us have been turned off by the party’s pivot away from these battles, even to the point where Senator Elizabeth Warren has been working with and funded heavily by Big Banks, not to mention her and many others extreme hostile takes against the revolutionary technology born in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis: Bitcoin.Here’s my take: Not only must the Democrats embrace Bitcoin to have a political future in America–I think many current and former members would be much more open to it. Rep. Ro Khanna is one leading example of a progressive democrat who understands where the Democratic Party has been losing ground to the Republicans on economic issues and Bitcoin. At the Bitcoin conference in Nashville this past summer, Rep Khanna stated, “Being against Bitcoin is like being against cell phones or the laptop, or semi conductors, it's a technology.” Bitcoin is for freedom.” Bitcoin advocates and campaign funding played a huge part in this year’s presidential election. While most democrats and the Harris campaign chose to mainly ignore Bitcoin and the industry, with some neutral or vague support of technology mentioned here and there, after a hostile four years under the Biden administration, this appears to be an error they couldn't afford to make. Many progressives and democrats may continue to speak out against the industry and the campaign financing and superpacs that brought in Big Crypto Money (which campaign financing and then bitcoin the technology are two different things), but it’s an issue that can no longer be ignored, and almost weekly seems to be growing more and more bi-partisan (including ownership of Bitcoin in America, shown to be exceptionally broad and diverse across the political spectrum from a recent survey conducted by Colin Brown, Troy Cross, and Andrew Perkins).Donald Trump and the GOP have used and garnered the single issue crypto voters in big ways. Campaign promises include protecting the right to self-custody, a U.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, to support the crypto and bitcoin mining industries, Free Ross, and more. We’ll see if he makes good on these promises, and it’s unclear how big of an impact Trump’s pro-crypto positions had on the election outcome, but it’s not negligible. And if anything, it also symbolized what we saw was very important for American voters– a big shift from the current administration, and big promises regarding the economy and economic prosperity for America. As the Democrats head back to the drawing board to determine the future of the party and their priorities, many are ready to go big, unburdened by what has been (sorry, had to) with the Hilary, Biden, Harris neo-liberal coalitions. And there’s one good place to start–the economy, stupid! Affordability, inflation, and hope in a brighter economic future for middle class and working families are winning priorities and what Americans at the end of the day show up in huge numbers to vote for. Bitcoin has a significant role to play in this approach and messaging, as an inflation hedge, incredible savings technology for working families, censorship resistant payments (should progressive activists find themselves in positions to need resistance money against Donald Trump’s authoritarian policies), and beyond. If the Democrats are serious about getting back to some of their roots as the party of working class people, including an olive branch to former independent and Bernie supports who are passionate about fighting for financial freedom and a better living for working class Americans, Occupy, and beyond, they will find Bitcoin is an incredible tool to that end. With Bitcoin there is no barrier to ownership, no middleman, not broker or bank you must use or be “accredited” byPermissionless, freedom money. Can this be a rallying cry for the next chapter in the progressive movement and for Democrats to utilize on the campaign trail? It almost seems inevitable…a when, not an if…that the Democratic party capitulates to Bitcoin and the American people’s demands, or face extinction. Myself, Margot Paez, and others from The Progressive Bitcoiner will certainly be here to advocate for a rebirthing of the progressive movement, powered by Bitcoin. This is a guest post by Trey Walsh.

Bitcoin Magazine,Trump Is Not Bitcoin's Savior,"Fri, 08 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/trump-is-not-bitcoins-savior,"Trump is not going to be a good thing for Bitcoin, he will continue the same malicious path of regulation that has been followed under Biden.","      The election is over, and Trump is now going to be President again. He pulled off something that hasn’t been done since Grover Cleveland in the 1800s, a successful re-election following a loss after his first term. People all of this space are celebrating this as some kind of victory for Bitcoin, but nothing could be further from the truth. Ross will likely be freed, Trump is too full of himself to back out of such a trivial to deliver on campaign promise, so he will probably do it. It’s too easy, and something he can parade around and take credit for, so it will happen. That is where anything substantial will end. A strategic reserve is not happening without the approval of Congress, even seized assets are by law required to be disposed of on the open market. Trump cannot from any reading of his authority I am aware of unilaterally push the federal government to begin accumulating bitcoin. Even if by some miracle that Congress did act to pass such legislation, what good does it do Bitcoin? A government accumulating bitcoin isn’t going to help make it more scalable, it isn’t going to make it more private, it isn’t going to protect it from government overreach and interference. It won’t even help us pay off our debt, the price appreciation necessary for such an outcome is frankly delusional. Instead the most likely outcome is more of the same. More attacks on Bitcoin privacy. More encroaching regulation in the form of KYC and AML. Miners will likely come under scrutiny as Bitcoin’s elevation onto the global political stage continues. The question of their liability and involvement in confirming sanctioned or otherwise undesirable transactions has already been floating around Washington D.C. for a few years now, the tone of those questions will likely get more serious. Exchanges and other on/off ramps will likely be pressured to engage in ever more invasive surveillance of their users in pursuit of stamping out terrorism, criminal use, child trafficking, etc. All of the traditional boogiemen of the digital world will be trotted out, and the regulatory noose will be tightened. Sure, Trump might push for enshrining self custody as a right, but does that on its own really provide any serious degree of freedom without privacy? Without censorship resistance? Trump even spoke in Nashville about regulations, and the expansion and endorsement of stablecoins. “People who see Bitcoin as a threat to the dollar have it exactly backwards.” He wants to push dollar backed stablecoins all over the world, taking advantage of a new route for us to export our inflation without the need for diplomacy. People in other countries can just use them, they don’t need their government to choose to dollarize, or hold dollar reserves. Just download an app and start using them. The approach he wants to take to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will breath new life into the dollar, and push Bitcoin down a path to stagnation and capture. People are cheering this on as a victory for Bitcoin, the reality is it is us entering the gauntlet. It is still an open question whether we can successfully run it and come out the other side without having to make serious and potentially fatal compromises. "

Trump won the 2024 election and became the 47th President of the United States of America. Simply put, this presidential victory changes everything for Bitcoin.As a non-U.S. bitcoiner, I usually don't care much about the US election and what happens in the U.S. But this time, it was different. I watched it closely. I was rooting for Donald Trump to win. Due to Trump's pro-Bitcoin pledges, I saw this election as a referendum on the old monetary system.Let's be real, when the U.S. sneezes, the world catches a cold. Almost every country looks to American regulations as the blueprint for new technologies.Now, with Trump pledging to make Bitcoin a reserve asset and pro-Bitcoin senators like Cynthia Lummis pushing for a bill for the US to buy Bitcoin and adopt it as a strategic reserve asset, every other nation has been put on notice. They must embrace Bitcoin or get left behind.Regulators worldwide face a massive FOMO moment. We should expect a wave of Bitcoin and crypto-friendly policies as countries scramble to accumulate Bitcoin reserves. No one wants to miss the boat.This is the point of no return for Bitcoin's legitimacy. Regulators can no longer dismiss it as some criminal tool. Now, it will be a reserve asset shining bright on the world's center stage.I foresee trillions flowing into Bitcoin from sovereign wealth funds, pensions, endowments, and more. The institutional FOMO will be unreal.What will the world be like when banks and governments are racing to accumulate? I don’t exactly know. But as someone who's been in Bitcoin for 8 years, this moment feels surreal. I never imagined we'd be here so soon. Bitcoin's time has come, and the next four years will propel it into the stratosphere as we move one step closer to hyperbitcoinization.This article is a Take.

While the cryptocurrency market celebrates, analysts warn of potential long squeezes and mass liquidations. Will Bitcoin maintain its upward trajectory or face a pullback? The market remains volatile.The postBitcoin Surges to Record $77,200 – Can the Rally Hold or Is a Pullback Next?appeared first onCryptonews."," Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to a new all-time high (ATH) of $77,200 on November 8, surpassing the previous record set a day earlier. The surge followed the U.S. Presidential election and the Federal Reserve’s decision to lower interest rates amid ongoing discussions regarding its monetary policy.  The cryptocurrency’s rapid ascent raised questions about the sustainability of this rally and the potential for a market correction. Bitcoin’s Ascent to New Heights Bitcoin’s recent rally has been nothing short of extraordinary. The digital asset has experienced a remarkable year-to-date growth of over 118%, with a nearly 25% increase in the last month alone.  The surge comes on the heels of positive seasonal trends and halving-year data, suggesting a bullish outlook for the leading cryptocurrency. Historically, Bitcoin has reached new ATHs during the last two election cycles and hasn’t retreated to pre-election price levels.  With a market capitalization of $1.5 trillion, Bitcoin now ranks as the ninth most valuable asset globally, surpassing Meta, formerly known as Facebook.  #Bitcoin flips MetaLoading… #1  pic.twitter.com/arUWX7tZtP— George Britto (@_georgebritto_) November 7, 2024  The latest ATH occurred approximately 48 hours after the U.S. presidential election, which saw several pro-cryptocurrency policymakers elected to Congress.  The price movement coincided with a sudden surge during Wall Street trading hours, mirroring the previous day’s activity.  Bitcoin’s volatile performance came as the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by the anticipated 0.25%. Following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the risk factors influencing the Fed’s inflation and employment mandate were “roughly in balance.”  “Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,” he added. “Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low.” The Fed’s Balancing Act Market consensus aligns with the Fed’s planned course of action, with expectations favoring a further 0.25% interest rate cut at the next FOMC meeting in mid-December, according to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool.     However, trading resource The Kobeissi Letter cautions that the Fed’s stance on interest rates could shift if longer-term inflation trends escalate.  “Ultimately, we expect to follow long-term inflation expectations which have not ticked higher yet,” they said on X. “However, if these do begin rising, as they now stand at 2.1%, we believe the ‘Fed pivot’ would be at risk. This is a big IF, but anything is possible as we head into 2025.” Bitcoin’s Market Dynamics and Potential Risks Despite the macroeconomic intricacies surrounding the Fed’s decisions, Bitcoin appears unfazed, reaching its highest-ever daily close.  According to CoinGlass, Bitcoin is up 8% month-to-date and boasts Q4 gains of 19.6%. Data from  CoinGlass data also reveals considerable liquidity building on both sides of the spot Bitcoin price on exchange order books.

Amid these liquidity shifts, trading account CryptoMutant anticipates a “little pump before this overheated market makes a correction.”  Another trader, CrypNuevo, foresees the possibility of a “long squeeze,” a cascade of long Bitcoin liquidations, before the weekly close.

Top analyst predicts BTC could reach $100K+ soon. Discover the factors driving this bullish momentum. Learn more!The postCan Bitcoin’s Parabolic Rise Hit Six Figures? Analyst Says “Yes” – Here’s Howappeared first onCryptonews.," Bitcoin (BTC) recently reached a peak of $76,940, marking a fresh milestone for the cryptocurrency. The rally follows the Federal Reserve’s decision to lower its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, sparking renewed investor interest.  This change brought the rate down from 4.50% to 4.75%, setting the stage for a potential surge in BTC as traders look to hedge against traditional currency volatility.  The surge aligns with prominent analyst Kevin Svenson’s optimistic prediction of a six-figure Bitcoin price. Analyst’s Forecast: $142,000 Target by October 2025 Crypto analyst Kevin Svenson has projected that Bitcoin could reach $124,000 by March and even hit $142,000 by next October. According to Svenson, BTC must first break through the $94,000 threshold, which serves as the critical resistance level in a descending broadening wedge chart pattern.  Should Bitcoin succeed in surpassing this barrier, the price could rapidly ascend to Svenson’s March target of $124,000.  However, Svenson warns of potential market volatility, suggesting a possible summer correction before a late-year recovery.

Traders are encouraged to consider profit-taking strategies as the cryptocurrency approaches these speculative highs. Bitcoin Gains Momentum Amid Global Economic Uncertainty Bitcoin’s rise is further supported by geopolitical factors and potential currency risks. JPMorgan analysts have pointed out that, should Donald Trump win the U.S. presidential election, inflationary pressures could spark a ‘debasement trade’—where investors turn to assets like gold and Bitcoin to protect against a declining dollar.  They believe ongoing tariffs and political uncertainty will reinforce this trend, potentially pushing BTC higher.

Bitcoin Eyes $80,000 as Bullish Momentum Holds Above Key Support Levels Bitcoin’s price remains strong, currently trading at approximately $75,980, supported by recent bullish momentum. Key Fibonacci levels indicate that the price may aim for $77,800 and potentially $80,400 if the rally extends.  Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Immediate support lies at $72,160, with the 50 EMA at $73,580, reinforcing this support zone. The RSI is at 63, indicating Bitcoin is nearing overbought levels, which may lead to short-term consolidation.  A breakout above $77,800 could open the path to the $80,000 mark, while a breach below $71,000 would signal possible downside pressure.

A record $1.4bil into spot btc ETFs today…Now $25.5bil net inflows since January launch.Continue to rewrite ETF history books.And remember, these still aren’t fully available on most large wirehouse platforms (or at all on Vanguard).— Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) November 8, 2024  In just under a year, IBIT and 11 other spot Bitcoin ETFs have collectively garnered $25.5 billion in net inflows, with IBIT leading the pack as institutional interest in cryptocurrency grows. Institutional Demand Spurs Record Inflows The timing of IBIT’s explosive growth coincides with recent developments in U.S. economic policy. Following Donald Trump’s victory in the recent U.S. presidential election, combined with a Federal Reserve rate cut, institutional investors have flocked to crypto assets as a hedge against traditional market volatility.  Jeff Mei, COO of crypto exchange BTSE, commented, “[Trump’s victory], combined with the Fed rate cut on Thursday, spurred institutions to make the plunge into crypto markets.  With more rate cuts expected and potential pro-crypto regulations on the horizon, the momentum in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is likely to continue.”  IBIT Net Assets: $33.17 billion (as of Nov. 7) IAU Net Assets: $32.9 billion Single-Day Inflow Record: $1.1 billion on Nov. 7  The inflows into IBIT underscore a shift in how institutions are diversifying their portfolios, with many viewing Bitcoin as a long-term asset rather than a speculative investment.  This trend aligns with a recent study by Schwab, which found that millennials, in particular, are increasingly interested in crypto-focused ETFs.  Schwab noted, “Millennial ETF investors have the strongest appetites for ETFs and are most interested in personalized ways to invest.” The report suggests that crypto ETFs could continue to see robust growth as younger investors enter the market. SEC Approval Boosts Bitcoin ETF Liquidity In September, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved BlackRock’s proposal to list and trade options for IBIT, further increasing its appeal to institutional investors. Options trading, while typically associated with speculation, can also provide hedging opportunities, making the ETF attractive to both retail and institutional investors. Market structure analyst Dennis Dick remarked, “Counter to common opinion, options actually reduce volatility. As open interest rises, it creates natural buyers and sellers on both sides of the market, increasing liquidity and reducing volatility.”  The availability of options trading on IBIT is expected to enhance liquidity and stability, a positive sign for investors concerned about Bitcoin’s historical price swings. With this new level of accessibility, the ETF’s options market may create a more stable price environment, encouraging additional inflows from investors who were previously wary of Bitcoin’s volatility. Bitcoin’s Path to $100,000: Market Sentiment Remains Strong The unprecedented growth of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has sparked discussions about the potential for Bitcoin to reach $100,000 in the near future. As BTC currently trades around $79,000, analysts are eyeing significant technical levels.   According to recent data, Bitcoin has completed the 161.8% Fibonacci extension at $77,810, with the next resistance levels projected at $80,400 and $82,180. A continued rally could lead to further gains if institutional inflows persist. Key insights from analysts include:  Resistance Levels: $80,400 and $82,180 as next targets Support Levels: $75,460 and $73,610 Technical Indicator: RSI in overbought territory at 76, signaling potential consolidation  While Bitcoin’s ascent to $100,000 is far from guaranteed, the rapid success of IBIT reflects shifting sentiment among investors who are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a viable long-term investment. The inflows into BlackRock’s ETF are part of a broader trend as institutional investors explore alternative assets to hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.   Bitcoin’s Path to $100K? Market sentiment is heating up! With BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF surpassing $33B, BTC is rallying at $79K. Analysts target key levels at $80,400 and $82,180. Could institutional inflows push BTC to new highs?  #Bitcoin #Crypto #ETF— Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) November 10, 2024  As market sentiment continues to build around the idea of pro-crypto regulatory frameworks under the new administration, analysts believe Bitcoin’s appeal will only grow. The convergence of institutional demand, regulatory shifts, and financial innovations such as ETFs could ultimately drive Bitcoin to new heights, with $100,000 no longer seen as an improbable target but a realistic milestone in the coming years. – You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034  Pepe Unchained ($PEPU): Why It’s a Strong Buy for Crypto Investors Right Now With the rise of meme coins, Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) is quickly emerging as a standout opportunity for potential gains.

Crypto News,"$200,000 Bitcoin? Standard Chartered’s Bullish Note Predicts $10 Trillion Crypto Market","Sat, 09 Nov 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/200000-bitcoin-standard-chartereds-bullish-note-predicts-10-trillion-crypto-market/,"Bitcoin to hit $200,000? Standard Chartered predicts a $10 trillion crypto market by 2026, fueled by U.S. regulatory shifts and altcoin growth. Discover key insights.The post$200,000 Bitcoin? Standard Chartered’s Bullish Note Predicts $10 Trillion Crypto Marketappeared first onCryptonews."," Standard Chartered has just issued a positive outlook for the digital assets space saying the market will hit $10 trillion by the end of 2026 – 4x from where it is now. According to the report, Bitcoin will be $200,000 and Ethereum will be over $10,000.  That’s up from Bitcoin’s current $76,500 and Ethereum’s $2,950. The bank is expecting a regulatory shift in the US driven by recent political developments.  “The next two years could mirror the price surges seen in 2021,” the bank noted. “Digital assets are likely to see both value increases and the emergence of new sectors, as real-world use cases become mainstream.”  Acts of Regulatory Reforms Under Trump’s Potential Return to Office A key part of Standard Chartered’s forecast is Trump’s potential return to office. His campaign promises to lift the regulatory lid on crypto have got the markets excited.  Standard Chartered expects that the Trump administration with a Republican Congress could pass several crypto friendly regulations to support growth including:  Repealing SAB 121, allowing banks to safely custody crypto assets Introducing stablecoin legislation to foster broader adoption Halting the SEC’s crypto crackdown, providing clarity for digital assets Considering a U.S. Bitcoin reserve (though deemed unlikely)  These anticipated measures could inject substantial momentum into the crypto sector. The bank underscores that regulatory clarity is vital to attracting institutional investment and accelerating the adoption of digital assets, which would create further upside potential. Altcoin Growth and Real-World Use Cases: Solana’s Outperformance Expected Standard Chartered’s forecast also points to a shifting dynamic within the digital assets ecosystem. While Bitcoin is projected to see substantial gains, the bank anticipates a drop in its market dominance from 60% to 40% by 2026, as real-world applications of altcoins gain traction.  Key sectors likely to fuel altcoin growth include:  Gaming: Blockchain-based games creating new revenue streams and user experiences Decentralized Infrastructure (DePIN): Networks supporting decentralized physical infrastructure Social Media on the Blockchain: On-chain social platforms offering user-driven experiences  The bank highlights Solana as a top altcoin contender, expected to outperform both Bitcoin and Ethereum due to its versatility in supporting applications across these emerging use cases.  “Tokens with real-world utility are poised to capture more market share as adoption broadens,” Standard Chartered stated.  Key Takeaways  Bitcoin Projection: Expected to reach $200,000 by 2026, reflecting strong market confidence. Regulatory Shifts: Possible Trump administration reforms could unleash significant crypto growth. Altcoin Ascendancy: Altcoins with real-world applications, like Solana, positioned to outperform.  Standard Chartered’s analysis offers a compelling case for the future of digital assets, highlighting regulatory shifts, market dynamics, and real-world applications as key catalysts. With Bitcoin and altcoins reaching new potential, investors are poised to witness a transformative phase for cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Price Eyes $80,000 as Uptrend Faces Key Resistance at $77,800 Bitcoin is consolidating around $76,440 within a rising wedge pattern, hinting at potential exhaustion near $77,800, its immediate resistance level. Breaking above could target $80,350, but the wedge structure suggests caution.  The RSI sits at 60, reflecting moderate bullish momentum, while the 50-day EMA at $71,000 offers a robust support level, aligning with key Fibonacci retracement zones.  Immediate support lies at $75,400, with further levels at $73,600 and $72,150 if a downturn materializes. A break below these supports could signal a broader correction.  Overall, Bitcoin remains cautiously bullish, yet indicators point to possible near-term consolidation or a pullback if resistance levels aren’t cleared soon. – You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034  Crypto All-Stars Nears $3.2 Million in Presale with 494% Staking Rewards Ahead of Price Increase As Bitcoin adoption continues to surge, Crypto All-Stars is making waves in the crypto space with its highly successful presale, nearing its target of $3,349,831.

Bitcoin’s all-time high price comes at the heels of Donald Trump winning the U.S. elections, which instilled hope of pro-crypto regulations. The largest cryptocurrency climbed 4.83% over the past 24 hours, peaking at $80,071.17 earlier today. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $79,834.97 with a market cap of $1.58 trillion, CoinMarketCap data shows. Ethereum has also made gains this week, crossing the $3,000 mark. Bitcoin’s price has grown by around 80% this year. Since Trump’s win on Nov. 6, Bitcoin price has shot up by over 15%. Bitcoin’s growth has also outpaced those of traditional investments like stocks and gold. Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market-making firm Auros, told Bloomberg: “With the dust from Trump’s victory still settling down, it was only a matter of time before a run-up of some sort occurred given the perception of Trump being pro-crypto, and that’s what we’re seeing now.” After changing his stance on crypto, Trump made several promises to the crypto sector during his campaign. For instance, he vowed to fire the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairperson Gary Gensler on his first day back at the White House. Trump also talked about creating Bitcoin reserves and has promised to bring in pro-crypto regulators and lawmakers. Moreover, digital asset firms and executives invested heavily in Trump’s re-election campaign and they are now hoping to reap the rewards as Trump fulfills his promises. With the Republicans holding majority, crypto executives believe pro-crypto legislation to pass through more easily. Binance CEO Richard Teng told the Financial Times that Trump’s victory marks the start of a “golden era” for the cryptocurrency industry. He called Trump’s success a “big win for crypto.” Crypto mergers and acquisitions are also expected to increase during Trump’s second presidency. The crypto industry has indeed shown signs of optimism since Trump became the president-elect. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) bagged massive inflows this week—iShares ETF’s trading volume reached an all-time high on Nov. 6 while a day later daily net ETF inflows reached nearly $1.4 billion. However, Trump may face legal difficulties in delivering some of his promises. For instance, Gensler’s term ends in July 2026 and the SEC is an independent agency, meaning Trump does not have authority to fire him. Besides, Geoff Kendrick, an analyst at Standard Chartered, told the Financial Times that the creation of a Bitcoin reserve fund is a “low-probability event.” Crypto analyst who goes by the pseudonym of Doctor Profit on X believes that if the market holds to the current momentum, BTC price could reach $100,000 by the end of the year.

Bitcoin Magazine,The Race Is On To Frontrun The U.S. Government,"Mon, 11 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-us-wants-to-buy-bitcoin-will-other-countries-do-it-first,The US wants to buy bitcoin. Will other countries do it first?,"     Follow Rizzo on X.https://x.com/pete_rizzo_/  With the 2024 election all but final, it’s clear Donald Trump, the soon-to-be 47th President of the United States, will be the most pro-Bitcoin leader in U.S. history The big question remains, however: How effective will he be in operationalizing his strategy? At Bitcoin 2024, Trump – as well as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis – made clear that they want the United States government to buy Bitcoin. All would seem to be in a better position to enact this following the election, as the Republican Party increased its representation in government considerably. Yet, as for how quickly the U.S. could become active in the market, that’s more murky. Since announcing the bill, Bitcoin has surged from $60,000 to a high of $86,000, and with the U.S. government soon to be buying, there’s even more incentive for the price to escalate. Herein lies the problem: The United States has essentially telegraphed to the world that it intends to buy an asset that’s in scarce supply, without the concrete ability to do so.Even with a majority in the House of Representatives and Senate, passing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Legislation 2024 will still require an act of Congress, and the agreement of lawmakers. It would seem foolish to expect this won’t be complex or time-consuming. For example, the bill proposes revaluing the Federal Reserve’s gold holdings, as well as integrating Bitcoin into government financial systems. Questions will likely abound, as will operational challenges. Let’s remember it took all of three years for SEC Staff Bulletins to be adjusted just to value Michael Saylor’s public markets Bitcoin buying spree correctly. This is the nature of government — slow and bureaucratic. Even with Trump, RFK, and other Bitcoin backers in positions of power, the chances that the U.S. government begins to acquire Bitcoin on January 20, 2025 seem infinitesimal. This is not saying that it won’t happen at all, just that it won’t be timely. This is even to omit that there could be a prioritization challenge. Maybe the crypto lobby wants to move quickly on the long delayed market infrastructure bill. If so, Congress could become more consumed with the guardrails for exchanges, and redefining securities laws than the question of the strategic reserve. After all, they helped bankroll Trump’s win.How much could Bitcoin rise in the meantime? With the bull market in full force, I’d argue that institutions and governments have every reason to become active in the market. There are many regimes around the world where the executive branch has enough power to begin accumulating Bitcoin today. They’d be foolish not to frontrun the U.S. government.El Salvador started this process in 2021, and it has amassed over 5,900 Bitcoin. Yet, it faced 2-3 years of market headwinds, as traders countered its entries. Lest we forget El Salvador bought hundreds of Bitcoin at $60,000, a move that for years was fuel for its enemies. Trump may yet do his part to boost Bitcoin. Yet, in telegraphing his intentions, he’s almost certainly created conditions that can be exploited by savvy traders. Time will tell them if, among them, we’ll see other nation states.Today, I received confirmation that another nation state is currently discussing - a Bitcoin strategic reserve- drafting Bitcoin mining regulations so they can improve their electrical grid and better monetize stranded energyIt's happening— Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) November 11, 2024  "
Bitcoin Magazine,Thank You Donald Trump for Bitcoin's All-Time High,"Mon, 11 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/thank-you-donald-trump-for-bitcoins-all-time-high,"It's off to the races for Bitcoin, with no signs of slowing down.","     Follow Nikolaus On X Here  Just as I called it a few weeks ago, the election was too big to rig. I said the outcome of the election would dictate when we see a new Bitcoin all-time high. My argument was that if Trump won, we would see Bitcoin rise to a six figure price and if Kamala won, BTC would have dumped hard.But thankfully, pro-Bitcoin Donald Trump swept the election, winning all swing states and the popular vote. His anti-Bitcoin opponent lost in dramatic fashion, and now it's off to the races for Bitcoin’s price. Even CNBC is reporting on this as the “post-election rally.”Trump's proposed policies for Bitcoin has propelled bitcoin’s price upward — it's now up over 22% since last week. If Trump had lost, the price of BTC would have most likely plummeted due to Harris’ unfavorable policy around Bitcoin and overall horrible policy around financial markets in general — like wanting to tax unrealized gains. Now, we’re past that, though, and we have a President-elect that is going to champion Bitcoin innovation, support the industry and has pledged to work with congress and the senate to approve and establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. In addition to that, MicoStrategy is raising $42 billion to buy more bitcoin and Bitcoin ETFs are on an accumulation rampage (BlackRock’s ETF did $1 billion in volume in just 35 minutes this morning) — and it feels like no one is selling. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸— Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) November 6, 2024  Oh, and on top of all that, Ross Ulbricht is going to be a free man on day one of Trump’s presidency. We are winning on every single front now.So, thank you President Trump for saving us from the Democrats' war on Bitcoin, from four more years of their continued attack on this industry and, of course, for bitcoin’s price making new all-time highs (we just hit $85,000! Let’s go!)This article is a Take. Opinions expressed are entirely the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine."

Strategic reserve While Bhutan’s crypto investments are not new, the kingdom’s position as a significant Bitcoin holder has drawn fresh attention following Donald Trump’s election victory. Advocates within the crypto community have long speculated that a US-led Bitcoin reserve might become a reality, especially with Trump’s support for digital assets and deregulation. Lawmakers have already introduced draft legislation to create such a stockpile for the US, while Trump himself has previously said he would ensure the US does not sell the Bitcoin it already holds. Bhutan, which began building its Bitcoin reserves several years ago via mining, now finds itself at the center of this global dialogue, not for initiating a new movement but as an example of how smaller nations might navigate digital asset adoption. The appreciation of Bhutan’s holdings exemplifies a forward-thinking strategy that could serve as a model for similar economies seeking to diversify beyond conventional reserves. Trump’s pro-business stance and openness to deregulation have fueled expectations that his administration could endorse Bitcoin as a strategic asset, potentially reshaping how the US approaches its reserves. Financial analysts believe that a US Bitcoin reserve could shift the dynamics of sovereign wealth, influencing other countries to adopt similar policies. This has given rise to much speculation about which country could be the first to go public with such an intent. Nation-state adoption Satoshi Act Fund CEO Dennis Porter recently teased people to “guess” the first country to begin accumulating Bitcoin as a reserve asset, hinting that he knew the answer. Some speculated that he was talking about the US; however, other rumors suggest it could be one of several other countries, including Qatar and the UAE, both of which have been the centerpiece of such unsubstantiated rumors for a while now. Apollo CEO Julian Fahrer shared a list of the eight leading sovereign wealth funds, including the UAE, China, and Norway, that are well-positioned to adopt Bitcoin as part of their national reserves. Unsubstantiated reports have further stoked this speculation, particularly rumors of an unknown entity purchasing 100 Bitcoin daily over an extended period. Initially rumored to be Qatar, this activity remains unconfirmed, leaving open the question of whether it’s linked to a government entity or another institutional buyer. If Trump’s administration does pursue a Bitcoin reserve, it would mark an unprecedented shift in US financial policy, potentially influencing global markets and signaling a new era in digital asset adoption among nation-states.

The increase pushed year-to-date inflows to an unprecedented $31.3 billion, bringing global assets under management to a record $116 billion. CoinShares’ head of research, James Butterfill, highlighted that trading volumes for exchange-traded products (ETPs) jumped to $20 billion during this period—their highest level since April. Bitcoin and US lead inflows CoinShares reported that Bitcoin captured $1.8 billion in inflows last week, contributing to a $9 billion influx since the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut in September. Butterfill attributed this momentum to favorable macroeconomic conditions and significant changes in the US political landscape that bolstered investors’ confidence in the market. He stated: “A combination of a supportive macro environment and seismic shifts in the US political system being the likely reason for such supportive investor sentiment.” Notably, US-based funds accounted for $1.95 billion of the $1.98 billion in inflows, followed by Switzerland at $23 million and Germany at $20 million. Notably, the US Bitcoin ETF sector remained especially active, with BlackRock’s IBIT fund drawing in roughly $1.3 billion, while outflows from Grayscale’s products continued to decline. Market observers noted that the strong inflows into IBIT indicate a growing interest in Bitcoin-backed financial products. In addition, these flows also point to the broader trend of digital assets gaining traction within mainstream investment portfolios. Ethereum and altcoins show renewed interest Ethereum also experienced a surge in inflows, drawing $157 million, its highest weekly figure since exchange-traded funds launched in July. This uptick signals a renewed interest in ETH among institutional investors. Other altcoins saw modest gains as well. Solana, Uniswap, and TRON posted inflows of $3.9 million, $1 million, and $0.5 million, respectively. Meanwhile, blockchain equities attracted an additional $61 million, underscoring rising demand across the digital asset space.

This purchase comes amid a broader crypto market rally that has seen Bitcoin price rally to a new all-time high of more than $82,000. However, the Michael Saylor-led company stated that it purchased each Bitcoin in its latest purchase for $74,463. $20 billion in Bitcoin MicroStrategy said its total Bitcoin holdings currently stand at 279,420 BTC, which represents about 1.3% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply. To date, the firm has made a total Bitcoin investment of $11.9 billion, with an average acquisition cost of $42,692 per BTC, accounting for fees and expenses. At current market values, these holdings are worth over $20 billion, leaving the company with an unrealized gain of more than $10 billion, as per Saylortracker’s data. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin yield—an indicator of returns from its BTC holdings—was recorded at 7.3% from Oct. 1 to Nov. 10. The metric stands at 26.4% year-to-date. Bitcoin yield highlights the company’s ongoing focus on enhancing shareholder value through its Bitcoin investment strategy. Following the announcement, MicroStrategy shares rose by roughly 10% in pre-market trading, reaching $270, according to Google Finance data. How this purchase was funded MicroStrategy said it utilized funds raised through stock sales under two recent agreements to purchase these BTC. In August 2024, the company stated that it entered a $2 billion sales agreement with several financial firms, including TD Securities, The Benchmark Company, and BTIG, allowing for the issuance and sale of Class A common stock as needed. On Oct. 30, 2024, MicroStrategy also entered into a $21 billion sales agreement with additional agents such as Barclays Capital, Cantor Fitzgerald, and Mizuho Securities. As of Nov. 10, the company had sold a total of 7,854,647 shares, raising around $2.03 billion in net proceeds. So, with the August agreement nearly depleted, future stock sales are set to proceed under the October agreement. Meanwhile, despite the potential for share dilution from these sales, each outstanding MicroStrategy share still represents 0.00124464 BTC, with approximately 197.3 million shares in circulation, according to MSTR-BTC tracker data. Bitcoin price fell 0.5% as the news broke, falling from $82,300 to $81,800 as of press time.

However, historical patterns don’t really line up with such a bullish scenario. Across each Bitcoin cycle, the price increase has been around 27% of the last period. Should Bitcoin continue this trend, we may still have cause for optimism, albeit not with satoshi/dollar parity quite yet. Bitcoin halving price increases (Source: TradingView) The price increase for each halving cycle appears to diminish significantly over time.  First Halving (to Second Halving): 10,300% increase Second Halving (to Third Halving): 2,800% increase Third Halving (to Fourth Halving): 738% increase  Each cycle shows a substantial reduction in the percentage increase. To forecast a trend, let’s analyze the approximate rate of decrease:  From Halving 1 to Halving 2: (2800 / 10300) ≈ 27.18% of the previous increase. From Halving 2 to Halving 3: (738 / 2800) ≈ 26.36% of the previous increase.  If we continue this diminishing rate, Halving 4 might see an increase of around 26-27% of the previous Halving’s percentage increase: 738 * 0.265 ≈ 195.57% Estimate for Halving 4: We could estimate an increase of approximately 195% over the halving price. This follows the trend of diminishing returns per cycle. Such a price increase would take Bitcoin to a peak of around $180,000 this cycle. Bitcoin halving 2024 price increase (Source: TradingView) For fun, if Bitcoin were to break the diminishing returns pattern and increase by 50% or 100% of the last cycle’s increase, we would see prices of $304,000 and $520,000, respectively. Should Bitcoin somehow find the vigor of the 2017 bull run, it would rise as high as $1.8 million per coin. Remember, past performance is not a guarantee of future returns. Bitcoin is still in its infancy as an asset, and anything could happen next. Except, in my view, going to zero.

Bitcoin’s consensus model intentionally favors stability, with upgrades proceeding through a high-threshold process involving diverse stakeholders—miners, economic nodes, investors, developers, and media influencers—each bringing distinct motivations and pressures to the table. Steve Lee, Lead at Spiral—a subsidiary of Block (formerly Square) —has authored a comprehensive analysis of the intricacies of Bitcoin’s consensus mechanisms and the complexities inherent in protocol upgrades. Drawing from his extensive experience in product management and open-source development, Lee delves into the multifaceted roles of stakeholders, the potential risks associated with both soft and hard forks, and the critical importance of maintaining network stability amidst evolving technological advancements. His insights offer a nuanced perspective on the challenges and considerations essential for evaluating future modifications to the Bitcoin protocol. BitMex Research called Lee’s paper “fantastic” for succinctly detailing the evolving history of the BlockSize wars, a pivotal moment for Bitcoin’s consensus. Bitcoin segwit activation heatmap (Source: Steve Lee) Stakeholders in Bitcoin upgrade motivations evolve over time, reflecting practical and ideological concerns surrounding Bitcoin’s long-term stability. Understanding these forces is critical for evaluating potential future protocol changes. Bitcoin stakeholder power over time (Source: Steve Lee) Stakeholders in Bitcoin consensus upgrades The research outlines Bitcoin’s consensus model and categorizes stakeholders according to their influence, timing, and capacity to impact protocol adjustments. Economic Nodes, often high-volume transaction processors like exchanges, wield substantial influence when adoption rates for proposed changes become critical. These nodes determine which protocol changes are recognized as legitimate Bitcoin by selecting the client version they run. While Economic Nodes’ influence peaks near an upgrade’s activation threshold, miners gain leverage earlier, during the signaling phase, where their readiness can advance or stall potential soft forks. Investors, developers, and media influencers, with varied interests and timelines, also shift their involvement at different stages, creating a nuanced interplay of support or resistance. Protocol changes through soft or hard forks introduce distinctive challenges and considerations. Soft forks, favored due to backward compatibility, tighten existing rules without requiring all nodes to update. However, soft forks can lead to a bifurcation in node classes—updated and non-updated—potentially creating subtle but impactful divides within the network. Conversely, hard forks necessitate full network consensus and require all nodes to upgrade to prevent permanent chain splits. While hard forks permit more extensive protocol modifications, they carry heightened risks of network fragmentation, as stakeholders may align with different versions of Bitcoin based on ideological or practical preferences. Alternative clients, representing potential divergence from Bitcoin Core, add further complexity to the decision-making process. All protocol upgrades have historically occurred through Bitcoin Core, with alternative clients rarely gaining significant adoption. However, as developers increasingly explore client options outside the Core model, the prospect of contentious changes bypassing Core presents risks of fragmentation and the potential for a fractured network. The research highlights that a successful alternative client would need substantial support from miners and Economic Nodes, which has historically proven challenging. Should such a client achieve critical mass, stakeholders would face a network split, a scenario requiring careful navigation by developers, investors, and users alike to preserve value and security. Bitcoin SOM concept and gauging consensus Stakeholders’ varying degrees of engagement toward proposed changes play a substantial role in the stability of Bitcoin’s governance. The concept of “State of Mind” (SOM) provides a lens to assess how stakeholder engagement impacts protocol decisions. Categories range from active support (SOM1, SOM2) to passive awareness (SOM3, SOM4), to active opposition (SOM5, SOM6). Stakeholders who remain apathetic or unaware during the early stages of protocol discussions risk unintended changes proceeding without adequate scrutiny, potentially leading to precedents that may evolve Bitcoin in directions not widely supported. This apathy can delay consensus or create “whiplash” in stakeholder responses as they re-engage with a late-stage decision-making process. Another focal point is metrics to gauge consensus and assess the potential success of proposed changes. Unlike traditional corporate or governmental systems, Bitcoin’s decentralized structure requires interpreting signals from disparate, informal sources. Miner signaling, node adoption rates, and derivative market reactions provide partial insights into community sentiment. Monitoring developments on GitHub, participating in public discussion forums, and watching for announcements from major Economic Nodes help gauge consensus maturity and minimize the risk of unexpected contention or opposition. Tracking sentiment on social platforms and deriving insights from developer and stakeholder discussions offer a more comprehensive assessment of upgrade viability. The potential for contentious changes also surfaces the issue of “bounties” in network disruptions. Contentious forks create a scenario where funds locked in complex transactions, such as multi-signature or time-locked contracts, on one chain may become vulnerable to “bounty claims” if accessed on the alternative chain where security rules differ. This incentive structure introduces a distinct layer of risk, as actors may exploit soft fork vulnerabilities or take advantage of disparities between forks to access funds, heightening instability and posing long-term security challenges. Looking back at Bitcoin’s history Analyzing historical upgrades provides valuable context for future protocol adjustments. The activation of SegWit, a notable soft fork, exemplifies the iterative process Bitcoin requires for major changes. From miners to economic nodes, stakeholders participated in extended signaling, with future markets reflecting investor sentiment. Influential stakeholders, including developers and media influencers, shaped the debate, leading to consensus adoption. However, the challenges experienced during SegWit’s activation influenced the development of subsequent proposals, such as BIP8, which introduces the possibility of User Activated Soft Forks (UASF) with the option to force activation, bypassing miner veto. Understanding the fluctuating power dynamics between stakeholders across upgrade phases is key to anticipating future Bitcoin changes. For instance, economic nodes play a critical role as an upgrade reaches its activation threshold, while miners are most influential during the signaling period. Developers’ influence wanes as upgrades approach activation, shifting responsibility toward economic nodes and investors, who validate the market through trading activity. These fluctuations emphasize the importance of proactive engagement from all stakeholders, counterbalancing the potential delays and division that can emerge from an imbalanced consensus process. How to assess Bitcoin upgrade proposals Lee’s article’s recommendations for assessing protocol changes stress that successful upgrades in Bitcoin require not just code approval but robust stakeholder alignment. Stakeholders should evaluate proposals with an eye toward sustainability, considering factors like funding models, developer expertise, and potential effects on Bitcoin’s principles. Any upgrade’s implications extend beyond technical improvements, influencing Bitcoin’s stability, security, and alignment with its original vision. Bitcoin’s evolving consensus landscape emphasizes the necessity of a cautious and calculated approach to protocol changes. As stakeholders assess upgrades, the balance between innovation and Bitcoin’s foundational stability remains central to preserving its unique position within the digital economy. Lee’s complete analysis is published on GitHub and available for free.

The report noted that Trump’s plan includes using forfeited Bitcoins in a strategic reserve, though it acknowledged potential legal obstacles. “Trump has also ventured into NFTs, selling limited edition collections, and is in the process of launching a DeFi project, World Liberty Financial,” said Cipolaro. Bitcoin Hits New ATH of $84,000 NYDIG noted that legislative proposals, such as the Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT21) Act and stablecoin regulations, could gain traction under the new administration.  While immediate legislative action is unlikely, the report emphasized a trend towards regulatory openness. In addition, the analysis suggested that the SEC might pursue settlements or even drop certain cases against crypto firms, including Ripple Labs, Coinbase, and Binance.  The Commission could reconsider Wells notices issued to companies like Uniswap, Consensys, and Crypto.com.

The crypto market has now entered full risk-on mode, with the Greed and Fear Index approaching “extreme greed” territory. As a result, the total market value of all cryptocurrencies soared by $150 billion to over $2.75 trillion on Monday. Sector-wise, the meme coins saw the biggest buying frenzy, pumping 18.5% in the past 24 hours, from $73.69 billion to $87.33 billion. On a per-token level, the sector’s rising star, Pepe Unchained, continues to steal the show, adding $1.6 million in just four days since its last milestone. Pepe Unchained’s latest explosive fundraising round is driven in part by another major whale buy, pushing its total funding close to $27 million. With solid demand for $PEPU, investors are clearly positioning themselves ahead of the token’s major exchange listing. Those who haven’t yet participated can still join the presale and secure $PEPU at $0.01249. However, in less than 14 hours, the price of $PEPU will increase as a new funding round begins. Bitcoin at $100K is now a possibility, what does it mean for Pepe Unchained and other meme coins? When Bitcoin first breached $20,000 back in 2020, the idea of it reaching $100,000 seemed like wishful thinking. As crypto critics would argue, “It’s nothing but a bubble – just another tulip mania.”  After enduring several crypto winters and facing scandals that shook the entire industry, Bitcoin has, indeed, defied the naysayers. With its recent price action, the $100,000 milestone now feels more like an imminent reality than a far-off dream. The six-figure digit target come against the global backdrop of low interest rates, providing rocket fuel for a possible Bitcoin moon ride, while historically, post-election periods –  as The Crypto Dev notes on X – have often served as the phase of a cycle for the top crypto to reach new all-time highs.   #Bitcoin history is exactly repeating. $BTC to 100K and beyond is confirmed. pic.twitter.com/W5yjJUTD4f— The Crypto Dev (@TheCryptoDev_) November 8, 2024  While some may view Bitcoin as too pricey to consider at this point, WealthSquad’s Chris pointed out on X that future generations will likely look back in disbelief, lamenting how today’s generation was able to buy Bitcoin below $100,000 – much like how today’s generation complains about boomers buying property at much lower prices back then.  The same way young people complain about how boomers bought houses for under $100k, the next few generations will complain about us buying Bitcoin under $100k— WealthSquad Chris  (@CJ_Johnson17th) November 10, 2024  As Bitcoin reaches for these heights, the effects are trickling down to altcoins, as investors seeking accelerated returns often turn to altcoins. And it is altcoins in the meme coin sector that are probably the ones to watch most keenly.. In fact, meme coins are currently all in the green, outpacing Bitcoin’s gains. Dogecoin ($DOGE) is up 23% in just the past 24 hours, while Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has jumped 13.9% in the same time frame. Benefiting from Solana’s ascent to the $100 billion club is DogWifHat ($WIF), which has risen 23.12%. But for the most massive gains, it’s often the newer tokens that take the lead. And there’s nothing newer – or more impactful – right now than Pepe Unchained. In just four months since its presale stage began, the token has already raised more than a quarter of $100 million. Whales believe that Pepe Unchained is the ticket to surpass even the gains of its sector Pepe Unchained whales are making their presence felt with increasing frequency, as large buys are becoming the norm for the project. In the first 11 days of Moonvember, Pepe Unchained has already seen substantial whale participation, far outpacing last month’s activity. Just last week, a whale purchased $6 million worth of $PEPU – approximately $77,000 – while the week prior, another whale acquired 2.2 million $PEPU for $27,000. Over the weekend, the latest whale purchase was a 4.6 million $PEPU acquisition, valued at around $63,000.  Ethereum Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | Etherscan Whale buys carry significant meaning, particularly in signaling smart money flow. These purchases indicate that investors with greater financial resources – often including investment funds with deeper market insights – are placing sizable bets on a project they believe holds substantial potential. The fact that whales are backing Pepe Unchained at this early presale stage suggests strong future prospects, positioning it as the potential moon ride that crypto investors are looking for beyond Bitcoin and the mainstream ones in its sector. What whales are excited about Pepe Unchained Whales don’t enter a presale merely due to FOMO. In recent weeks, Pepe Unchained has announced new key updates highlighting its upcoming Ethereum L2 chain, which is designed to address Pepe token ownership’s current limitations. In October, the project launched its developer grants program and showcased a preview of this L2 chain in action. More recently, on November 7, Pepe Unchained unveiled its meme coin launchpad, set to rival Solana’s Pump.fun, and positions Ethereum as the new go-to chain for meme coin launches. Solana has become the preferred platform for meme coin projects due to its faster, cheaper transactions compared to Ethereum. However, with Pepe Unchained’s meme coin launchpad, Pepe’s Pump Pad, Solana’s dominance could witness its twilight.  Pepe Unchained promises to offer up to 100x more transaction capacity than Ethereum, with perhaps the lowest fees possible in the market. This makes it ideal for the high-frequency and low-cost trading requirements of meme coins. What further sets Pepe Unchained’s launchpad apart is that it effortlessly taps into its memetic power, thanks to its distinct Pepe flavor. These are just a few reasons analysts and crypto influencers are increasingly bullish on Pepe Unchained’s potential. In the video below, Austin Hilton shares his thoughts on how $PEPU could perform once listed:    Are you ready to join the Pepe Unchained presale? Here’s how To purchase $PEPU, visit the project’s official website. Connect your wallet and exchange $PEPU for ETH, USDT, or BNB. Credit card payments are also accepted.

It is worth mentioning that the Trump’s victory, along with the election of pro-crypto figures in Congress, has revived hopes for a more favorable regulatory environment in the United States, where investors believe fewer restrictions will likely open doors for growth and innovation in digital assets.   #Bitcoin $BTC has just hit a new ATH of $82K  pic.twitter.com/UcUejm6adH— BNB Swap (@BNBSwap) November 11, 2024  During his campaign, Donald Trump promised to recognize Bitcoin as a strategic asset for the US and hinted that the government would become a long-term BTC holder.  At the moment, the US government holds about 208,109 BTC, worth around $16.57 billion. This commitment could stabilize the market by reducing the risk of oversupply, with many hoping it may soon push Bitcoin closer to the $100,000 milestone. Bitcoin Hits Record Highs Amid Institutional Investments and Post-Election Optimism As we mentioned above, Bitcoin recently reached a new all-time high of $84,400, pushing its total market value over $1.6 trillion. This strong jump is due to growing confidence in the market after Donald Trump’s recent election win, with his promises to strengthen the U.S. role in digital assets.  The rise also shows strong interest from big investors, like BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which raised $1.1 billion in one day.  Overall, Bitcoin ETFs attracted $1.34 billion in new investments, with companies like Fidelity and ARK 21Shares also seeing large inflows.  #Bitcoin Just Hit $82K  pic.twitter.com/bKjPRPRVIJ— Nitin Dwivedi (@dwivedinitin) November 11, 2024  Donald Trump’s win, especially in important states like Arizona, has increased excitement. Investors are hopeful about his plan to create a Bitcoin reserve for the U.S., which could encourage more people to use crypto.  Copper.co’s Head of Research believes Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by Trump’s inauguration on January 20, thanks to growing investments in Bitcoin ETFs.  This excitement has helped boost the entire crypto market, which now has a total value of $2.71 trillion, showing strong interest from both big investors and the public. MicroStrategy’s Bold Bitcoin Strategy Sparks Market Optimism and Boosts BTC Price Moreover, MicroStrategy has made incredible profits from its bold investment in Bitcoin, showing that its long-term strategy is paying off. The company, led by CEO Michael Saylor, has been buying Bitcoin since 2020, even during times of market uncertainty.  This approach has proven successful as Bitcoin’s price continues to rise, putting MicroStrategy in a strong financial position.  Many see this move as visionary, especially as traditional companies typically avoid such large investments in digital assets.  MicroStrategy Records Staggering Bitcoin Profits: Visionary Investment Strategy Pays Off https://t.co/OjMEuVV3Jg#Bitcoin #BTC #MicroStrategyhttps://t.co/OjMEuVV3Jg— ETHNews (@ETHNews_com) November 11, 2024  MicroStrategy’s success has also fueled positive sentiment in the wider crypto market. Other companies and investors now view Bitcoin as a profitable and reliable asset, prompting a growing wave of institutional interest.  This confidence has been particularly boosted by recent increases in Bitcoin’s value, making MicroStrategy’s investment look even more impressive. The company’s example could inspire others to explore Bitcoin as a serious long-term investment, further strengthening its role in the financial world. Therefore, these substantial Bitcoin profits have boosted investor confidence, driving more institutional interest in BTC and positively impacting its price. This growing demand from major players has added upward pressure on BTC, supporting its recent record-breaking price gains. Bitcoin Surges to $84,150 Amid Strong Bullish Momentum, Eyeing Key Resistance at $84,600 Bitcoin’s bullish rally continues, climbing to a new peak of $84,150. The primary pivot point is at $82,250, a critical level consolidating recent gains.  Immediate resistance is found at $84,600, with the next barriers at $87,160 and $90,000. Support lies at $80,400, with further backing levels at $77,800 and $75,400.   The RSI has entered overbought territory at 81, signaling potential caution for new buyers. The 50-day EMA around $68,500 provides a longer-term support buffer.

This morning MARA, the largest publicly-traded Bitcoin mining company, shared that it will be rolling out three new data centers in the U.S.Would it have made such an announcement had Harris won the election? Probably. (It’s not like they whisked up these data centers overnight.)But would they have made the announcement with such gusto, highlighting the fact that the bitcoin the company mines will be “Made In USA”? Probably not.American compute power is accelerating. Today, we’re announcing:-Three new data centers.-Owned and operated in Ohio.-372 megawatts of capacity.#Bitcoin - Made in USA. pic.twitter.com/ltDbhKrCHJ— MARA (@MARAHoldings) November 11, 2024  The “Made In USA” line is likely a nod to President-elect Donald Trump, who’s said he wants all future bitcoin mined in the United States.Since Trump won the election, the stocks for bitcoin mining companies across the board have skyrocketed, with CleanSpark (CLSK) even being halted due to such breakneck upward price action, indicating that not only miners but also investors believe that Bitcoin mining is welcome in the U.S. and that the industry will thrive as a result.And it isn’t only Bitcoin miners who feel that Bitcoin companies are safe to operate in the U.S. Alex Leishman, CEO and CTO of Bitcoin exchange River, also believes that the Trump administration will be kind to Bitcoin businesses (and Bitcoin holders).Major risks to Bitcoin have been removed or made substantially less likely this year:- Federal Ban / Chokepoint (with Trump this is much less likely)- Gox coins dumping (coins have already been distributed)- Self custody ban (less likely with Trump)— Alexander Leishman 🇺🇸 (@Leishman) November 11, 2024  In this tweet, Leishman seemingly refers to the promise Trump made in his keynote speech at Bitcoin 2024 to protect the right to self-custody and to stop the Federal bureaucracy from unlawfully cracking down on the Bitcoin and crypto industry.Will Trump follow through on all of his promises? Hard to tell.It seems likely that he will, though, as money talks and the Bitcoin/crypto lobby raised millions for Trump’s campaign.For now, though, optimism abounds, which is refreshing after four years of the Biden administration, which made Bitcoin and crypto companies feel uneasy about their status in the U.S."

As of press time, the flagship crypto was trading at $87,169, up almost 10% for the day and roughly 25% since Donald Trump was declared the winner of the 2024 US elections on Nov. 6. The surge in Bitcoin has also led to a wider market rally, with many altcoins reaching new local highs and some hitting price discovery along with Bitcoin. Some speculate that the surge is a sign of retail returning to the market. However, Coinbase remain far from the top 10 app on iOS, while google searches for “Bitcoin” remain far below the levels seen during the peak of the 2021 bull run. Analysts believe the current surge is mostly the after-effects of the “Trump trade” playing out and primarily driven by people “FOMO-ing” back into Bitcoin after selling at previous highs in anticipation of a reversal.  Dogecoin (DOGE) has displayed an even more impressive climb since the elections due to Elon Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration and his historical support for the memecoin. DOGE was trading at $0.33 as of press time, up 47% in the past 24 hours and the highest price seen since 2021. The memecoin has been one of the strongest performers in the top 10 after climbing 121% over the past week and nearly 190% over the past month. According to DefiLlama, BTC is up nearly 38% monthly and shows a strong correlation of 0.97 points with the Pearson Coefficient. Since the Pearson Coefficient varies from -1 to 1, where 1 is the maximum positive correlation between two variables, DOGE will likely increase when BTC does. Ethereum (ETH) also performed well amid market optimism, climbing 6.5% over the past 24 hours to $3,328.29, the highest level since Aug. 3.  However, given Bitcoin’s strong performance, the ETH/BTC pair is down 3.6% to 0.3816 BTC but higher than the all-time low hit on Nov. 3. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) hit a new local high at $223.6, its highest since December 2021, while its market cap has climbed to a new all-time high at $104.4 billion. In the US stock market, crypto-related stocks also display outstanding performance. MicroStrategy’s MSTR registered a new all-time high after nearly 25 years at $340.31, following a 24.5% price increase. Additionally, Coinbase’s COIN is up by 22.1% daily, priced at $330.59, the first time above $300 since November 2021. COIN shares are less than 3.6% short of its all-time high registered on Nov. 12, 2021. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Index showed virtually no price variations today, which makes COIN and MSTR performances even more significant.

Bitcoin Sees New Highs Amid Altcoin Anticipation Bitcoin soared to $88,000 on November 11, surging past its March 2024 high of $73,000.  Some experts credit the rising price of Bitcoin to President-elect Donald Trump’s victory over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, leaving many to wonder: will altcoins be next?    While Bitcoin season is marked by ballooning demand, altcoin season reflects a period of rapid growth and volatility for a range of alternative digital assets, such as Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH). 2024 alone has seen a heightened interest in Bitcoin from the masses, thanks largely to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving several ETFs related to the token. However, with Trump’s pledge to fire the federal agency’s chair Gary Gensler, and enact digital asset-friendly regulations, the entire cryptocurrency sector may receive a boost when he returns to the Oval Office. Crypto Community Eyes Altcoin Season Key factors to consider when assessing whether it is altcoin season include an increase in altcoin dominance, rising trading volumes, coin price breakouts, and the altcoin season index. According to BlockchainCenter.Net, the altcoin season begins when over 75 percent of altcoins outperform Bitcoin in at least a three-month span. According to the crypto website’s index, the last time a true altcoin season occurred was January 2022, with its altcoin rating at 37 as of Monday, November 11. Interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve may also support altcoin activity, though recent Bitcoin investors and public figures such as X CEO Elon Musk have called to abolish the Federal Reserve Banking System altogether. Trump, who most recently launched his family’s crypto platform World Liberty Financial, frequently taunted his connection to digital assets while on the campaign trail in recent months. In August, the former reality television star hinted at potentially utilizing Bitcoin as a means of helping to eradicate the nation’s growing $35 trillion debt. “Who knows, maybe we’ll pay off our $35 trillion,” he told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo during an August 2 interview. “Hand them a little crypto check, right? We’ll hand them a little Bitcoin and wipe away our $35 trillion.” The post Bitcoin Smashes Past Record $88,000 Milestone Just Days After Hitting $80,000 – Is “Altseason” Next? appeared first on Cryptonews.

Bitcoin Magazine,The Trump Pump: A Road To Capture and Failure,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/the-trump-pump-a-road-to-capture-and-failure,Bitcoin ossification is ultimately the result of incentives and the size of the network making improving it impossible to coordinate. That happening too soon is not a good thing. ,"      Well the “Trump Pump” seems to be ripping off spectacularly. Everyone is cheering, euphoric, happy, feeling on top of the world. Knock it off. Yes, the number is going up, everyone’s net worth (on paper) is increasing by the hour, but this is not a matter of celebration. This is Bitcoin entering the gauntlet. These institutions, this administration, these high net worth individuals, they are not your friends. They are not here for the same reasons as people trying to build a monetary network centered around sovereignty and freedom. They are just here to make a buck, and to maintain this disordinate level of influence and control over the world around them. These people don’t give a shit about self custody being scalable, or privacy being accessible, or Bitcoin doing anything to bring these tools of freedom to the masses. They care about Number Go Up, that is all. If this run really does turn into what it looks like it could, this presents an existential crisis for Bitcoin. All of these people are buying their seats at the table, and those seats come with much more influence than the aggregate of the average person who has been working hard to accumulate bitcoin the last few years. Bitcoin consensus is dictated by the economic actors actually using it. If Bitcoin becomes a simple financialized asset dominated by the legacy institutions and actors that it was built to free us from, then proportionally to their level of use they decide consensus. The only choice left to us is to convince them, or deviate by forking off on a much less valuable (and therefore less useful) network. These people dominating the network this early, before the necessary work is done to make this a viable and scalable network, is sprinting down the road towards ossification. Of people being stuck with no viable option except being wealthy already, or picking their choice of trusted third party to interact with the protocol and network. And none of these people will care. Why would they support protocol upgrades that improve the scalability or privacy of Bitcoin? They make their living, all they know how to do is insert themselves as middlemen between the average person and the asset they want to interact with, making money by rent seeking as that intermediary. What incentive would they have to unseat themselves from that lucrative position? Bitcoiners should not get complacent simply because existing holders are watching their net worth increase during this bull market. There is a lot more to do, otherwise Bitcoin will not live up to a fraction of its potential as a tool to spread real freedom. So what do you value more? Getting rich or helping spread a tool to liberate people who are currently subject to the whims of tyrants and rent seekers?This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,"The Truth About Bitcoin Price Models: Stock-to-Flow, Power Law, and Beyond","Wed, 13 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-truth-about-bitcoin-price-models-stock-to-flow-power-law-and-beyond,"Discover the strengths, limitations, and practical applications of popular Bitcoin price models like Stock-to-Flow and Bitcoin Power Law, and learn how to leverage real-time metrics for smarter investment strategies.","Predicting Bitcoin's price has always been a hot topic for investors. Matt Crosby, lead market analyst at Bitcoin Magazine Pro, explores this topic in his recent video, ""Truth About Bitcoin Stock To Flow, Power Law & Price Models"". Here, we break down Crosby's key insights to help investors enhance their Bitcoin strategies.   Stock-to-Flow (S2F): A Useful Tool, Not a Crystal BallThe Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model is one of the most popular ways to predict Bitcoin prices, and Crosby explains its benefits and drawbacks clearly.Key Takeaways:What Is S2F? S2F assesses Bitcoin's scarcity by comparing the ""stock"" (current supply) to the ""flow"" (newly mined coins), similar to how rare commodities like gold are evaluated.Updated Predictions: The Cross-Asset S2F model initially forecasted Bitcoin hitting $288,000 between 2020 and 2024. More recently, it suggested a possible valuation of $420,000 by April 2025.Limitations: S2F works until unexpected events—like global economic changes—disrupt Bitcoin's usual patterns. Crosby aptly points out, ""S2F works until it doesn’t.""While S2F is a helpful guide, it's essential for investors to consider broader market conditions and macroeconomic influences alongside it.   Bitcoin Power Law: The Long-Term ViewCrosby also explores the Bitcoin Power Law, a model that uses a log-log chart to illustrate Bitcoin's historical price patterns.Why It Matters:Logarithmic Scaling: By using logarithmic scaling, the Power Law highlights Bitcoin's long-term trend of reduced volatility and moderated growth.Limitations: This model offers insights for the long haul but is less helpful for short-term predictions or market surprises.For investors aiming to diversify their portfolios and strategically time their investments, the Power Law provides context but should be used with other, more dynamic tools.Real-Time Metrics: The Key to AdaptabilityCrosby emphasizes the limits of static models like S2F and the Power Law, advocating for real-time, data-driven approaches instead.Tools Investors Should Use:MVRV Z-Score: Measures market cap against realized cap, identifying when Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued. SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio): Provides insights into market sentiment by tracking profit-taking behavior.On-Chain Metrics: Metrics like Bitcoin's realized price and value-days-destroyed help detect market turning points.These metrics give investors the tools to adapt their strategies to the market's behavior in real-time rather than relying solely on predictions.   Why External Factors MatterCrosby cautions against relying only on Bitcoin-specific data, emphasizing the importance of external factors:Global Liquidity: Bitcoin's price often moves with global liquidity cycles, making macroeconomic awareness crucial.Institutional Adoption: Actions by major players such as sovereign wealth funds, corporate treasuries, or institutional asset managers can greatly influence Bitcoin's price.Regulatory Changes: Government decisions to regulate or adopt Bitcoin can significantly affect its valuation.Incorporating both macroeconomic factors and Bitcoin-specific metrics is key for a well-rounded analysis.Final Thoughts: Stay PragmaticCrosby concludes by reminding investors that no single model can predict Bitcoin's price with certainty. Instead, these tools should be used to provide structure and insight into an unpredictable asset.Practical Tips for Investors:Use Multiple Models: Cross-check predictions using different models to gain a clearer understanding of the market.Embrace Real-Time Data: Rely on metrics like MVRV Z-score and SOPR for timely, actionable insights.Adapt to Change: Be ready to adjust strategies based on both internal data and external influences.Bitcoin Magazine Pro offers advanced analytics and real-time data to help investors navigate this fast-paced market.

Bitcoin Magazine,"Bitcoin May Hit $100,000 Faster Than Expected","Wed, 13 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-may-hit-100000-faster-than-expected,"At this rate, hitting $100k this week seems likely.","     Follow Nikolaus On X Here  It’s been just over seven days since Trump was re-elected as president of the United States, and bitcoin is up over $18,800 (25.3%) at the time of writing. And it’s currently steamrolling its way towards $100,000.I cannot lie, this is all happening way faster than even I expected.$100,000 has, for the last four years, been the magic number Bitcoiners have been laser-focused hitting. It felt like there was consensus among Bitcoiners during the 2021 bull run that we were guaranteed to hit this target. But alas, the 2021 bull run underperformed most people’s expectations, with bitcoin’s price only reaching a high of $69,000 (which in retrospect, was a great run considering the low of the previous bear market was ~$3,000), $100,000 bitcoin was put on hold. But now, we’re almost there.I feel like the price of BTC loves to do the opposite of what everything thinks it will do. Just when everyone thinks bitcoin is going to rip forever, bitcoin’s price falls or stagnates and vice versa (which is why it might not be so safe to assume we’re going straight to $100,000 from here).Even I’m guilty of this, as I’ve been telling myself for a long time that the battle for $100k is going to be extremely tough with the amount of sell pressure I was predicting there to be. I think $100k is a number at which traders, ETF buyers, and OG whales may take some profit and that it would be an uphill battle to get there. And it still very may well be, considering we are only at $93,000 currently. But since Trump won the election, there has been practically no sell pressure, and we’re slicing through new all time highs like a warm knife through butter.Bitcoin is now up over $5,500 (6.22%) today alone. If Bitcoin continues this momentum, we could see $100,000 BTC literally any day now — including even today. Nothing is off the table. Throw all your models out the window, they’re all being broken by the buying pressure from these ETFs and those trying to front-run the U.S. government’s implementing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.Bitcoin is on its path to taking on gold as a legit reserve asset. $100k is the next big milestone for bitcoin to hit along this journey, and it may just come faster than expected.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Will the Second Crypto President Be Like the First?,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/will-the-second-crypto-president-be-like-the-first,"A look at the history of cryptography regulations under Bill Clinton, and what this might imply for cryptocurrencies under Donald Trump.","This is the dawning of the Age of Crypto. Again.Number 47. The Bitcoin President. The Crypto President. The Cryptocurrency President.But not: The Cryptography President.Back when the word “crypto” meant “cryptography”, the personal computer and the rise of the internet were new tools of expressing freedom and power. The industry driving it was brand-new. New capabilities. New challenges. New regulations. At the center of it all was “cryptography”: a magic power that had once been reserved for secret agent missions and dapper 007 Bonds (not the financial kind). Except that it had reached the point where it was turning up in public and corporate software. The unlikely duo of corporations and freedom-fighters were banding together to usher in a new era of public empowerment through the possibilities of encrypted software and internet use. After considering the political landscape, they found their candidate that they would support to become “The Crypto President” - democrat Bill Clinton. And then he did what early polls said he had no chance of doing. He won.And that was when all hell broke loose. Clinton betrayed them.But what else is new? What did those voters in 1991 expect? What do we expect now? What can anyone expect other than what they’re told? It doesn’t take much for a presidential candidate to attach their name to a cause and lasso in a new group of voters and funding. For example, the newly elected President of the United States, Donald Trump, walked up to a podium on May 5th, 2024 and swung his lasso with just five sentences. No policy framework. No convincing evidence. Just five sentences to tie his platform to the Crypto and Bitcoin communities.Lesser known than this public moment is the one that happened away from prying eyes: a dinner at the home of tech entrepreneur David Sacks, co-hosted by Chamath Palihapitiya and featuring other powerful voices of Fintech & Crypto. Many of them democrats. Trump left that dinner with twelve million more dollars for his campaign. More valuable than that, he left with the anointing from a new industry looking for a political fighter to lead the way.32 miles away and 32 years before, Bill Clinton found himself at Apple Chairman John Sculley’s house. They poached salmon alongside 135 other, heavily republican-leaning, silicon valley entrepreneurs. Clinton would leave this dinner with more funding and the backing of the burgeoning new industry. Sculley, in a message to his fellow silicon valley contemporaries would say “I am still a republican, but I am voting for Bill Clinton.” It’s at this gathering, that it was understood that Clinton was going to break the issue of encryption wide open for the industry. That the biggest restraint holding them back, arms regulations, would be removed. Clinton would go on to burnish a few other broad themes to show his support of the software and internet industries, but without any real details of the actual actions he would take to achieve these promises.Promises about Bitcoin today are flowing from many of Trump’s “MAGAvengers” as they’ve been called. Cynthia Lummis, Robert Kennedy Jr., Vivek Ramaswamy, Howard Lutnick, Elon Musk, JD Vance, Tulsi Gabbard have all spoken on how they see Bitcoin fitting into the next administration. It’s hard for anyone watching to not be impressed by the amount of thought and uniformity of pro-Bitcoin stances that they have shared. Further, Trump has mentioned implementing a Bitcoin and Crypto advisory board to bring in even more educated voices into the government. Maybe if Trump drops the ball, we can still count on some of these other Trump affiliates to step up.While Clinton didn’t have the MAGAvengers to back up his broad promises, his cabinet might still have been even more impressive than Trump's. Did anyone in Trump’s group invent the internet? It’s a long-running joke about Clinton’s vice president, Al Gore. And while he most definitely did not invent the internet, by that point in time he already had years of piling up successes in legislation fighting for software and the internet’s future before it was politically popular to do so. John Podesta, after a full legal career fighting and lobbying against the very export controls that were suffocating encryption, was assigned as the head of Clinton’s transition team and then to the White House chief of staff. Podesta and Gore would bring with them a very intentional list of academics and eclectic tech experts. The length of hair and amount of sandals worn in political hallways was about to skyrocket off the charts. Cyberlibertarian John Perry Barlow would describe the incoming eccentrics as “Extremely smart, conscious freedom-lovers. Hell, a lot of them are Deadheads (fans of the Grateful Dead). I was sure that after they were fully moved in, they’d face down the National Security Agency and the FBI.”The deck was stacked. The future for silicon valley had never been brighter. And in less than a year, the computer, internet and crypto industries would see the most draconian laws laid down in the history of computing. Bill Clinton’s cabinet faced the NSA and FBI. And the NSA and FBI won.The greatest breach of crypto freedom from Clinton’s legacy came in the form of the clipper chip and its encryption package “Skipjack”. They nearly put a government backdoor into every electronic device in the US. On top of that, it was being spun as a win for the American people. It was technically providing them with stronger encryption than they were ever allowed before. So, in a way, Clinton was delivering on his pro-crypto platform that he had promised. But like a wish from a monkey’s paw, the reality of the president making good on his promise was a reality far worse than the one Americans were already stuck in. Fortunately, there was enough public outcry that met with difficulties of production and economic incentives to leave this Big Brother timeline dead in the water. There was more regulatory overreach, whether it was other backdoor initiatives, the creation of CALEA and its dominance of electronic surveillance, funny business between the FBI and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, presidential directives and executive orders targeting telecommunications and information systems, and further support of the export controls that were choking encryption in its cradle.It wouldn’t be until the very end of Clinton’s first administration when he was running for another term that he finally caved and relaxed export control laws. And what do you know? The Phil Zimmermann and Daniel Bernstein trials had already just concluded and encryption was ruled by the courts to be protected by the First Amendment. Clinton’s move to finally relax export control laws around encryption could be seen as nothing more than a symbolic gesture following up on the power reversal that had already taken place behind his back.The times we live in always feel unique and important. Trump’s return to presidency, the current blurring state of politics, and the rise of Bitcoin are all complex factors that will significantly impact our lives. But history is not without its rhymes. During Bill Clinton’s time in office there was a unique shift in party lines, complicated global politics with the fall of the USSR and Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, and a new software and internet industry that was very young and exponentially expanding year-after-year. If our storylines continue to rhyme, then we may not need to worry about “whether Trump supports Bitcoin or not”. But rather “will Trump’s support of Bitcoin do more harm than good?”. Will “good for Bitcoin” be bad? Afterall, Bitcoin's progress up to this point has largely been thanks to a large cast of programmers that got to build it outside of the scrutiny of regulation. And if the question of “more harm than good?” lands on the wrong side of the coin, do we have a Zimmermann/Bernstein card up our sleeve to check regulatory and legislative overreach?It’s impossible to foretell. One thing we can be sure about knowing at this point is that the age of Bitcoin building in the shadows has just ended.This is the dawning of the Age of Crypto, bitcoiner. Again. And if past is prologue, then “good for Bitcoin” could likely mean anything but.This is a guest post by AIS.

Bitcoin Magazine,I Bought Bitcoin Today – And Felt Nothing,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bought-bitcoin-today-felt-nothing,"Usually, buying Bitcoin is a joyful process. I’d have the satisfaction of picking up at least a bitcent. ","I looked at my wallet and saw a sad six digits. It used to be seven, or such was the case after I rolled over the balance of my monthly expenses, dollar cost averaging into Bitcoin and then sending it to my Casa cold storage.  Follow Rizzo on X.https://x.com/pete_rizzo_/  Usually, buying Bitcoin is a joyful process. I’d have the satisfaction of picking up at least a bitcent. As someone who had that chance to buy Bitcoin at $50 (but thought better of it, LOL) it's been a bitter time over the years, dutifully stacking away in an attempt to undo my mistake. There’ve been milestones, leaps of progress, as even numbers were chipped away. I have to say, though, this purchase was particularly deflating. Yes, with the price soaring over $88,000, I knew I was buying the top, and I have every ounce of confidence that this purchase will be meaningful someday. I’m sure in 10 years someone will look back at this post and laugh, marveling about how you could buy 500,000 satoshis for $500. Hell, my purchase is already in the green.This is the process of Bitcoin’s Great Monetization, a steady step on its progress from random digits on a computer that were worth nothing to the next global reserve currency. I get it, I’m, as you would say, “bought in.” I have every intention to keep buying Bitcoin. After all, it’s where I spend every waking moment of every work day.What is this piece about? Call it an ode to malaise. I’m sure people are out there furiously stacking, afraid the Bitcoin price will run past $100,000 without them having any. Same with institutions, same with nation states. Seriously.What do they look at these bitcents and see? Are they buying happiness? Relief? Bitcoin, you great mirror. With every buy, we take our place in the long arc of history."
Bitcoin Magazine,Scaling Bitcoin Practically With Ark Labs,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/scaling-bitcoin-practically-with-ark-labs,"With Ark Labs, Marco Argentieri is fulfilling the latest stage in his mission to help people more easily transact with bitcoin.","Company Name: Ark LabsFounders: Marco Argentieri and Simone GiacomelliDate Founded: June 2024Location of Headquarters: EuropeNumber of Employees: Six full timeWebsite: https://arklabs.to/Public or Private? PrivateTen years ago, just after graduating from high school, Marco Argentieri began his career in Bitcoin.Some of his earliest work in the industry included helping people make remittance payments using bitcoin. From those early days, Argentieri looked at bitcoin more like a currency and less like an investment, and he helped to make it easier for others to use.“I had many people that were using Bitcoin because it was like a Western Union without the KYC hurdles, and it was much cheaper back then,” Argentieri told Bitcoin Magazine.“They were not even interested in bitcoin price or volatility. They were just using it to send money overseas,” he added.Fast forward to 2024, and Argentieri is still focused on the same mission: helping people to use bitcoin cheaply, easily and privately. Though these days he does this in a more sophisticated way via his company Ark Labs, through which Argentieri and his team develop the Bitcoin layer 2 Ark.What is Ark?Ark is an open-source protocol created to help scale Bitcoin. The protocol enables users to amortize the cost of a single on-chain transaction across many off-chain swaps. These swaps occur on Ark’s servers, and they’re most well-suited for Bitcoin users who already operate Lightning nodes.Ark servers were created to remedy the liquidity constraints of Lightning by allowing users to receive funds off-chain in what are called vTXOs (Virtual Transaction Outputs), which alleviates the need to open a channel and/or receive inbound liquidity. The off-chain system runs on Ark servers, which also enable unilateral withdrawals on-chain.Ark provides and sources the liquidity for the transactions it facilitates via its servers (instead of relying on peers for liquidity the way that Lightning does). Argentieri embraced Ark as a solution after acknowledging Lightning’s shortcomings.“Looking at a current scaling solution like Lightning, the developers were idealistic in the sense that they were saying ‘Okay, people should hold the keys, which is a big, big, big step. And plus they also run server and plus they also became very expert in liquidity management and whatnot,” explained Argentieri. “I think that hasn’t been a very realistic assumption for how people operate.”Argentieri founded Ark Labs under the pretext that just as most people didn’t want to deal with using bitcoin on their own for remittance payments 10 years ago, they don’t want to become experts in running Lightning nodes to make payment these days.“Ark tries to build on top of this assumption that there will be specialized people or specialized enterprises that know how to handle liquidity, and that's what we call Ark servers,” he explained. “Then you have like the clients — people that only want to send or receive a payment and use bitcoin. They don't really want to get into all the complexity,” he added.“Ark starts by assuming that not everyone is a peer, so there will be a liquidity provider on one side and a user on the other side. We acknowledge that this is the natural course of things — even though we may not like it.”Argentieri, a pragmatist, acknowledges that while the centralized design of Ark might not be philosophically flawless, it is effective.“The goal again was to have a protocol that starts working backwards from the user perspective and not from an ideal scenario,” explained Argentieri.“If you think from the user perspective, they really just want to have a user experience that looks like Bitcoin on-chain. With Bitcoin on-chain, you just have a key pair. You just create a simple key and, boom, you can receive,” he added, detailing how Ark works.A Bitcoin Interest RateUTXO owners can serve as liquidity providers for Ark, which Argentieri sees as an opportunity, especially for those in the West.“In the Western world, we know people really are attached to this concept of yield,” said Argentieri.“Westerners cannot just hold sats in cold storage and be good with it. They really feel that they’re missing something,” he added with a laugh.To both obtain liquidity for Ark servers as well as to quench Westerners’ thirst for yield, those willing can become liquidity providers to Ark in exchange for a small fee.“Ark is really like a way to introduce a bitcoin interest rate,” posited Argentieri. “Ark can be a discovery mechanism for a real true native interest rate for Bitcoin.”Argentieri described how liquidity providers can share a small percentage of their bitcoin holdings via what he terms a “warm wallet,” a wallet that enables users to hold the keys but that Ark still has access to.The yield would come in the form of transaction fees via the VTXO model. While Argentieri said that some may look at this as “financializing bitcoin,” he simply sees it as a win-win, a way to help scale while providing a small reward to those who provide the liquidity to help do so.Scaling HorizontallyWhile a layer 2 solution like Lightning helps Bitcoin scale vertically, Ark helps Bitcoin scale horizontally, according to Argentieri.“With Lightning, we set up one address and then two people can do an infinite amount of transactions between each other — but that doesn't scale,” he said.With Ark, a UTXO can provide liquidity for an exponential number of transactions compared to the amount of funds in the UTXO. Argentieri gave the example that 100 BTC can provide liquidity for tens of thousands of virtual transactions.Not only does Ark enable more transactions, but it’s also usable in many of the ways that Bitcoin itself is usable.“People are very focused on Ark for payments, but the beauty of Ark is that you retain most of the UTXO capability, which means that you can do 95% of things you can do in Bitcoin right now on ARK,” said Argentieri. “You can do multisig and you can open multiple channels with a single address.”Argentieri also shared that using Ark is nearly as trustless as using Bitcoin, because even if Ark shuts its servers down, you can still get your sats back on-chain.“If for any reason the server goes away, censors me or goes offline, the whole virtual transactions tree goes on-chain,” explained Argentieri. “This is what we call unilateral exit.”The Future of ArkArgentieri said that Ark is hard at work in preparing to bring Ark Node to market, a B2B enterprise-grade offering that Argentieri described as a “plugin for your LND node” that will help businesses with rebalancing liquidity.At Bitcoin Amsterdam last month, Ark Labs announced a partnership with Boltz to enable off-chain Lightning liquidity management, with the intention of making swaps faster, cheaper and easier via the Ark Node.Other than that, it seems Argentieri and the team at Ark Labs have a seemingly countless number of new advancements in the works, though, it will take the company some time to roll these out.“I'm living inside the action, so I wish to release things every week, but engineering takes time, especially when you are the first one doing these things,” he said.The plan for now is to remain on mission — the latest state of the mission he embarked on ten years ago.“We can really have a tangible result within the Bitcoin ecosystem,” concluded Argentieri. “People will see Bitcoin payments get better, and we hope to be part of the reason why that will happen.”"
Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Price and the Psychological Leap: The Journey from $100K to $1M,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/bitcoin-price-and-the-psychological-leap-the-journey-from-100k-to-1m,"As Bitcoin hits new all-time highs, a psychological shift is underway.","     Follow Mark on X.  Ah, Bitcoin. The most thrilling, gut-wrenching rollercoaster in the financial world. Every time it hits a new all-time high, there's a chorus of celebration, the clinking of virtual glasses, and the inevitable ""I told you so"" from that one friend who’s been holding since 2013 (you know the one). Well, here we are again—Bitcoin has once again shattered expectations. And as I watched the price tick upwards, I had an epiphany. It wasn’t about the price tag—it was about the psychology of it all. Specifically, the strange magic of big round numbers.Let’s take a moment and admire the humble yet powerful $100K milestone. For months, everyone’s been eyeing it like the golden prize on the horizon. Bitcoiners, with their eyes set on this threshold, have been nudging the price forward like ants moving crumbs. $60K? Almost there. $80K? Getting closer. But $100K? That’s the big one. It’s not just a number; it's a psychological barrier. Crossing it is not just about market value; it’s about transformation.Let’s break it down, shall we? We humans—bless our little brains—are inherently biased towards big, round numbers. They give us a sense of achievement. When your Bitcoin portfolio rises by $1,000, you’re likely to do a little victory dance. You see $1,000, and your heart skips a beat. It's a clean number, easy to digest. You start telling people, “Oh, Bitcoin just went up $1,000 today,” and everyone nods, impressed. Nice, isn’t it?But wait for it. Here comes the real twist. Once Bitcoin breaks through $100K, the game changes. That $1,000 rise? It’ll feel like pennies. Not because you’re suddenly richer, but because the context shifts. Suddenly, a $1,000 move is no longer a victory lap. It’s like stepping over a puddle when you’re used to climbing Everest. Sure, it’s still a move, but it’s not the same adrenaline rush.You see, when Bitcoin hits that magical $100K milestone, we’ll stop thinking in terms of absolute prices and start thinking in terms of percentages. And this, dear reader, is where the psychological fun begins. Those small $1,000 swings will be as notable as a single raindrop in a monsoon. Bitcoin’s price will start moving in $10K chunks, or $20K, or more. You’ll see a $10,000 move and think, “Ah, just another Tuesday.” The dopamine hit from smaller moves will wear off faster than you can say “HODL.”Here’s the real kicker: the next stop after $100K? $1 million. And once Bitcoin starts flirting with that number, we’ll all look back on those $1,000 or $10,000 moves with a chuckle. They’ll feel like mere stepping stones on the way to something far bigger. And at that point, all that will matter is the momentum—the relentless psychological pressure of “What’s next?”Of course, let’s not forget the emotional gymnastics involved. One day, a $10K swing will make you sweat like you're at the gym for the first time. The next day, you’ll barely blink when it surges $50K in a matter of hours—like a seasoned pro watching the tides roll in. That’s Bitcoin for you. It’s like riding a see-saw—one moment you're up, and the next, you're hanging on for dear life. And when Bitcoin crosses the $100K barrier, those swings will get even wilder. The price won’t rise in small, friendly hops anymore. It’ll leap, and it’ll leap fast.So, while we celebrate today’s price movement and all the jubilant chatter about Bitcoin’s latest high, let’s take a moment to reflect. What we’re really witnessing isn’t just a price surge—it’s a mental shift. A shift from small wins to massive leaps, from numbers that are easy to wrap our heads around to ones that’ll require us to think in percentages and contemplate the next horizon. And when Bitcoin hits $1 million? Well, that’s when the real fun will start.Hold on tight. It’s going to be a bumpy, thrilling, and, quite frankly, psychological journey.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,The Digit Addiction Pandemic,"Tue, 12 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-digit-addiction-pandemic-,A look at the compulsive and addictive behaviors encouraged by the structure of the fiat world.,"The Dystopian Present – Fiat Has Made Us All Digit AddictsEveryone wants to make you an addict. Some people sell illicit drugs on the black market and want you to become addicted to them so they can profit from you. The dealers naturally focus on drugs that are physically addictive because they are often the hardest to kick. When they do manage to addict you to them that becomes harder and harder over time. For drug lords and dealers, this is heaven. This virtually guarantees that all customers will be regulars, at least for as long as they survive. For the addict, it depletes the quality of their life. They start to live from one fix to the next. The problem for the dealers is the illegality of the product. Staying in business as a dealer requires a lot of care, caution, and expense. Additionally, much of the total addressable market (TAM) is turned off by drugs’ bad reputation. So what do you do?If the problem is legality, make legal drugs. The drugs sold in pharmacies are legal and in many cases no less addictive. There’s a drug for every complaint and three dozen for the common cold viruses. Some, like a simple nasal spray, are addictive and can lead to a chronic condition which “locks” you in for life. It’s the same basic business model as the street dealer but with less friction, lower risk, and much better optics. The barrier to entry is that the clients have to be ""sick"".Now consider supermarkets, where the market is perhaps saturated, but the TAM is almost 100% of the population – everyone eats. Junk food can be quite addictive and can make its users sick. Sick junk food junkies might turn to pharmaceuticals without changing their habits, compounding the problem. Now the cycle is complete. As bad as such addictions might sound, and as widespread as they are, the current global addiction is yet worse: the addiction to digits pandemic.The first case of addiction to digits is in terms of fiat currencies. They have the benefit of transacting with everyone in a particular country. It is very convenient to use those digits as a medium of exchange. Those digit addicts usually say: ""I can't buy anything with bitcoin, so I am not going to buy any."" They are saying, “I am addicted to the benefit of a convenient medium of exchange even though my purchasing power will deteriorate.”Some people realise that money is usually static. It’s active when people are transacting and passive when they’re just keeping it for later. To be an effective store of value, money needs to preserve (or grow!) its purchasing power over time. A person should not earn the same money twice. When I have savings I should not be forced to actively manage it. So whole market segments focus on the passive use of money. It is strange how the system forces you to actively use your money to solve the passive use - it kind of defeats the purpose. Still, you can't let it degrade because of inflation. Here there are a few main categories - bonds, real estate, equities, gold, and art.The bond's benefit is its promise to return more digits after some period. “Guaranteed” by the state. And they truly do! They give you the benefit of increased digits and at the end of the period even with the more digits, your purchasing power is less than when you started. Still, it beats the ones that just saved. The bond digit addicts will not buy bitcoin because bitcoin in cold storage pays no interest.The real estate benefit is a digit ""yield"" in the form of rent and the digit value of the property will be higher. The value of the real estate is a function of the returns it generates every month. The digit value of the building increases because the degrading of the fiat digits happens faster than the degradation of the physical structure. Real-estate addicts will not buy bitcoin because it is not physical and does not pay any digits for rent.Financial “engineers” invent products for people to bet on against each other. The whole premise of a stock market is that you sell something you have for another thing that may increase in digit value. Each trade has a winner and a loser, but like in a casino, the house always wins in the end. Just another addiction with another kind of dealer. The Bitcoin system is unifying everything into one. In a bitcoin economy, there are no losers because one person’s profit is not necessarily a loss for another. Those addicts would not buy Bitcoin because there is no betting system in Bitcoin and can't do call or put options or other illusionary ""engineering"" things so the insiders benefit. If you just buy Bitcoin and HODL for when you need it then all the dealers of that addiction will be out of business.Gold addicts are addicted to the metal without realizing how it can be used against them. How can anyone tell us how much the market cap of gold is if no one can tell us the exact weight digits of gold that it is found? This is the true Schrödinger's cat these days. Now owning gold is represented only by a number on a screen, reducing it to the same status as fiat. With fiat currencies, one piece of paper has the number 1 on top and the other has the number 100 on top. We do not care that they are on the same paper value but we value the digits that are written on the paper. The gold digit addiction is the same, but it took longer to foster because everyone can measure its weight rather than rely on arbitrary numbers. Nobody can put 100 on top of 1 kilo of gold and tell you that it is 100 kilos. But since digital displays of gold ownership have largely replaced physical possession, it follows the exact same mechanism as paper. Gold addicts say that bitcoin does not have any physical (metal) properties, so it has no value, and they won’t buy it.   How about the art digit addicts? Their views on bitcoin aren’t very well known since they aren’t very active in the discourse. The benefit of art is in the emotions it evokes. When Bitcoin starts to demonetize the art industry, we will see art digit addicThe Digit Addiction Pandemicts defending its value. Art should be art, it should not be a method for a store of value.The next digit addiction dominating today's societies is loyalty programs, like air miles, and loyalty points for discounts, promotions, and exclusive offers. Even to this day, my grandma is looking through the brochure of EVERY store in the area to find a discount of 10 cents cheaper bananas per kilo. Because the companies can't print currency digits they print loyalty digits. They not only have much greater purchasing power inflation than currencies (most of the time) but they also have much greater controls over when, where and how to actively use them. The addicts of the loyalty digits start orienting their lives around the loyalty program digits and the dealers love it.The next digit addiction is social media. People get addicted to subscribers, likes, views, etc. The benefit they provide is the platform, the ability to reach a far greater audience than through face-to-face interactions. This addiction is not directly connected to money, but all those digits are what promoters, sponsors and everyone is looking at sponsors and subscribers automatically convert metrics into value to assign worth in fiat.The next digit addiction is to video games. Gamers get addicted to the tokens needed to ""unlock"" the ""special"" item. They start chasing those token digits so hard in the virtual world that they forget to live in the real one. As young players age, their addictions often graduate from game tokens to other digit dealer systems.The current FOMO digit addiction is to blockchains. Their benefits include faster transactions, more anonymity, and smart contracts to get you hooked. If the creator is not a direct scammer and truly wants to give those benefits to people he is essentially saying that the benefit that he gives is more important than incorruptible money. The benefit of smart contracts is greater than incorruptibility. That is probably a misunderstanding that secure and decentralised money is the base that gives you certainty to build everything on top. If you want to launch rockets into space you do not change gravity to make your use case easier to achieve. If you do, you will destroy all the sports where people need to jump. All the tall buildings and trees will be collapsing because for winds it will be much easier to tilt them. You destroy the way of life on earth but it is nice that we can go to space. If you believe that the benefit is worth it then do the work and build it on Earth without destroying it. Build on Bitcoin!The next addiction is to the digits of the custodians. Bitcoin ETFs were hotly anticipated and have received plenty of acclaim. But their custodians are getting the punters hooked on convenience. Give me your bitcoin in my custody because you are inadequate to hold it yourself. Give me your Bitcoin, and I will give you digits.The common trait among all of these digit addictions is that they offer some benefit in return for dependence on certain digit lords. Once people experience the benefit, it becomes that is the thing that traps them. That is one of the struggles of the Bitcoiners to accept that there are benefits to all of the addictions mentioned above. Bitcoin has its benefits and limitations, but the benefits of Bitcoin do not negate the benefits of other things. This is the source of the greatest conflict between bitcoiners and crypto bros. Bitcoiners should not dismiss other crypto just because they are shitcoins. Instead, we should enter the arena and out-compete them just like we have been for the past 15 years. Some of them do provide nice benefits to get people hooked to their blockchain digits. When we as bitcoiners do not compete with them and learn what we can, we are going to deprive Bitcoin of those benefits. Bitcoin probably shouldn’t adopt every feature that emerges somewhere in the cryptosphere, but competition fosters improvement. As a former professional athlete, I can say that my skills improved the most after losing to a weaker opponent. When a weaker opponent defeats a stronger one, it only means that he revealed a weak spot. Just because the weaker opponent won does not imply that the rules are unfair and need to be changed or the weakling should be disqualified. That is the tactic of the fiat digit lords. If we want to beat more powerful opponents (i.e. fiat currencies), we must also face the weaker ones. Bitcoin’s obvious weak spot was, until recently, its throughput. Enter Lightning Network.. Privacy? Welcome to eCash on top of Bitcoin.The Battle for Control Continues in a New Domain – The Digit Lords Are Capturing Bitcoin Digit AddictsThe addiction is so ingrained in all of us that even when someone understands Bitcoin and its implications, they transfer their digit addiction onto Bitcoin. For them, the addiction manifests in HODLing, and the object of their obsession is ""How much do I have??"" and “Is the number going up??” I HODL and want the digit value to rise to give me the ""fix"" that I need. Still intoxicated by other digits, they are the easiest prey for the custodian digit platforms. By contrast, real Bitcoin maximalists value proof of work above all. Their primary goal is to build a better life for everyone through Bitcoin. Unless you’re building, you’re just a digit addict chasing your high with Bitcoin.Different people get addicted to different digits. But even if someone benefits a lot from their addiction, that does not mean it is right for you. Michael Saylor was instrumental in helping me recover from my fiat addiction and going clean on Bitcoin. At the same time, he’s hooked on the custodians’ digits. After all, he has billions in the custodians’ digit ecosystem. He preaches to people that it is better to have more custodians of bitcoin. Let's go ask all the “gold bugs” how that thing turned out for them. Do not get me wrong all the benefits that he is saying are right and they are benefits so what is the difference?   The difference is in the control. In the addictions described above, the users get the high, but they also get hooked. At the same time, a small group keeps control over the digits the addicts use and claims themselves as digit lords. In all those digit addictions, the mechanism is the same. Fiat digits are controlled by fiat digit lords. Air miles digits are controlled by the airline digit lords. Crypto bros are producing ever more blockchain digits with benefits that Bitcoin does not have (yet) to become the blockchain digit lords. The custodian's digits are controlled by the screen digits lords. They all control the addicts through the digits.Another reason why the addiction analogy fits so well is that detoxing is so hard. Wonder why ""Orange Pilling"" is a struggle? Have you tried to take the cocaine away from an addict, or the insulin of a diabetic, or the chocolate from a fat kid? Resistance is natural. A real estate mogul who has spent decades mastering his trade and amassing a fortune is naturally going to resist any force that could demonetise his industry. The HODLer junkies profiting from BlackRock’s ETFs and similar custodians will naturally resist any threat to the number-go-up fix. That is a marriage made in heaven. For the HODL digit addicts, you can see what infrastructure the custodians are setting up to capture you. Check the work of #WhitneyWebb and #MarkGoodwin in their collaborative articles about that topic.Gold provides a clear example of how the digit custodians work. To analyse gold, you go to a goldsmith who can assess the gold’s weight and purity, not an ETF dealer. The ETF dealer is just the street pusher for the ETF digit lords. They can describe the imaginary trend lines on top of their imaginary digits that are disconnected from the metal. Unless that particular ETF dealer has a direct line to the gold digit lords, his opinion is absolutely worthless. He is just the digit addiction dealer pushing someone else’s product to get his cut. Bitcoin ETFs are no different. Bitcoin can be used as a real store of value! In the fiat system, it is mainly “You store my value!”The digit lords’ model has its weaknesses. Some try to exploit the model’s mechanics for their own benefit and to avoid becoming addicts. For example:counterfeiting fiatinsider trading in the store of value digitshard and soft nepotism in the loyalty digit programshacks in gamesall of the above in blockchainsEven though they are not obeying expected addiction behavior, they are still addicts by chasing the same digits. The difference is that if they succeed they are branded criminals (hackers) by the digit lords. They are using the control system as designed and demonstrating that the whole system is exploitable. The exploiters can attain enormous power by those actions but that is not the intention of the system. The digit lords need control to remain a privilege and guard it jealously so that no one else can own the digits but them. That is why they need us to be hooked: no single person’s effort can overcome control over the digits. That is why any system that is disconnected from work will fail in the Bitcoin era. Bitcoin is the panacea able to cure all addictions. There is no free lunch in Bitcoin. Once connected to the open and permissionless Bitcoin network, all wallets, all investments, all loyalty promotions, all social media, all gaming tokens, and all blockchains will benefit from bitcoin and their first-mover advantage.First Look at The Addiction The Right Way - Then Take Responsibility to Break It and Be Free   Beyond the number go up addicts, analysts are also addicted to the models evaluating all the addiction digits. If Bitcoin is something genuinely new, then why are we using the same old modeling principles? The power-law model fits a number of real-world phenomena, including bitcoin through most of its history. From the growth of cities to metabolic rates and many other correlations relating to energy expenditure, the power law applies in a surprising number of cases. The power law is a functional relationship between two quantities, where a relative change in one quantity results in a relative change in the other quantity proportional to a power of the change, independent of the initial size of those quantities. In other words one quantity varies as a power of another. Funny how the name of the model coincidentally (or not) suggests using it for things connected to power. Bitcoin is inseparable from energy (power), so the power law is probably the proper tool. That is why the power law of the hash rate will never break even if the fiat price power law might.Since engineers have built Bitcoin, their models explain the technology best. But when it comes, to financial analysts they are not modeling reality - they are trying to model the collective psychology about particular digits. Elon Musk is not going to land a rocket on Mars powered by likes or fanboys. The only way is to model reality and then build it. Reality is uncompromising, and inspiration only takes you so far. Either the model is accurate and the execution works, or the rocket explodes. Over time, reality will defy even the best financial models, but they can accurately capture what the collective psychology values in the short term. That’s why the financial “engeneers” hypnotize the digital addicts and get them hooked. In the meantime, Bitcoin continues to do its thing regardless of what any of us think about its future - it is an uncompromising force of nature.Perhaps there’s a less fickle way to evaluate companies. Let's take NVIDIA, the current FOMO stock. The digit value unit of a stock is connected to a digit unit of the share. Neither quantity is directly connected to energy and, therefore, can be created at will. But what if someone maps the produced GPUs by NVIDIA? It is just a hunch but it probably follows a power law - the production capacity of the chips is limited by physics. The production of the company can’t break reality to scale but when you cross-reference it with the stock price, you may see when those digits are driven by the current psychology of the “market” or by fundamental value. #GiovaniSantostasi is the person to do the math on that and say if he can innovate a new way of evaluating stocks with the power law model. I may be talking out of my ass for the stocks valuation application of the model but he proved that this is the only model that maps the journey to hyperbitcoinisation.And what about digits that no one controls? Some digits are connected to reality, which is very useful: the digits for time, the digits for length, the digits for weight, and the digits for temperature. Reality does not care about what we think about it. Reality just is, and we use digits to understand it. That is the language of the engineers, not economists. The numbers not connected to physical energy are numbers backed by a group's opinion. They can be captured and controlled. Engineers’ digits are free. They resist control. Even those who haven’t mastered them can benefit from those who have. They are the ones building the roads, the computers, and everything else we need in modern life. The difference between open digits and controlled digits is that the addicts of the controlled digits depend on the digit lords for where, when, and how they can benefit. You can't use the digits of one country outside its borders freely. You can't use one company’s loyalty digit points with its competitors. You can't use the token digits from a game to buy a coffee. You can't buy MicroStrategy stock digits without a bank account.Michael Saylor always says that there is nothing worth buying in Africa even if you had a billion dollars to spend. That is grossly biassed towards the passive use of money – saving their purchasing power. If you are a billionaire it sure is a problem. But if you want humanity to flourish, the most important thing is to build stuff! Africa is a very important part of humanity, and we need to figure out what to build and how to facilitate spending, so they can get to the point of caring about store of value billionaire digit addiction problems and even beyond the addicion. Saving is just a partial view of that one store-of-value use case. My point is not that Saylor is wrong to protect his castle. Rather, we need to build castles for everyone and then they can start protecting them. His blind spot is that the custodians now want to co-opt Bitcoin as a store of value so they can continue the 2% inflation game and remain digit lords. The difference is that with Bitcoin the 2% inflation game runs on a decentralised global standard. Different countries and banks can connect to it and profit, but that attracts the degenerate custodians (companies, banks, and states) that will print digits on top of Bitcoin. At some point, a bank run on the most degenerate custodian digit lord is inevitable. Then the domino effect of bankruptcies that they can stop in the fiat system is not something that they can do in the Bitcoin system. So buckle up! The biggest volatility may lie ahead. The people that we call poor do not have access to custodian institutions, but now they can run their own Bitcoin nodes. For the first time ever, unprivileged societies have the tools to take back all the purchasing power that was stolen from them by the digit lords without spilling blood. Take control of the math you use, and take control over the money you use, so you can take control of the life you lead. Otherwise, there will come a time when you will beg someone in control to come and save you. This message is addressed to those without control, but this message is also relevant to those who already realise what Bitcoin is and need to prepare for the day when the addicts come and beg us to save them. We need to start working on becoming people of virtue #Alex Svetski. We must not become digit lords, but actually detoxify people effectively and cooperate. Do not sit on your hands, just HODLing. Build that future. Anyone who’s been in Bitcoin for more than 4 years (one cycle) should be running a node and taking more control into their hands. Anyone who has profited from Bitcoin’s appreciation should be thinking about what they want and how to integrate Bitcoin into those goals. No coding or technical expertise is required. All the analog infrastructures need to be integrated with the Bitcoin infrastructure. Barbers need to start accepting Bitcoin and telling the community. The barber infrastructure has to be connected to the Bitcoin infrastructure along with all the others.The digit lord companies should consider replacing air miles with sats? Replace in-game tokens with milisats? The digit lords could do this immediately. This is Bitcoin’s ultimate, imminent network effect. Inflation in all the addiction digits will accelerate. The digit lords will do everything they can to keep addicts in their digit drug ecosystem. At the same time, companies that have already adopted Bitcoin will actually save them from bankruptcy. The digit lords will then serve all of us, and whoever gives the most benefits will be the one that WE choose, and they will fight for our vote and support.Until you drop the digit addiction, you will never be free. Reality is uncompromising for those (companies or countries) who do not navigate its rules/laws properly. This is exactly the problem that the digit lords face as long as the digits are connected to reality. Someone can always verify the accuracy of the digits. I can lie about today’s date, but you can verify. I can lie about the weight of something, but you can verify - maybe not applicable for gold :). I can lie about your height, but you can verify. I can lie about the temperature, but you can verify. Now, for the first time ever, money digits are connected to reality through Bitcoin, and everyone can verify! Lies won’t last long. Just ask the FTX, Celsius, and Terra Luna digit lords. They may control their closed-digit systems, but no one controls reality. That is exactly why we will win #MartyBent! The digit lords are addicted to that control, but people are building solutions to transfer control from the digit lords to individuals. Whether the digit lords realise it or not, they are losing ever more digit addicts to a system that is detoxing them. Losing addicts is fine if you can get them hooked on another substance. Referring back to the chemical drugs mentioned above, that we looked at at the beginning of the article. This is why digit lords will do anything to keep their addicts hooked on the next digits. Now that people have Bitcoin – money inseparable from reality – we have clear detoxified heads. We will never go back to the addiction. The current dynamic is that the digit lords will chase our attention, but we will never give them back the control. I will happily take a discount on a vacation flight, but I will not serve the digits lords’ agenda. I will not obey the digit lords’ vacation plans for me whatever loyalty digits they offer. They will serve my plans and orient their services around my needs.One of my favorite phrases from #JeffBooth: There is no they; there is only we! It is incumbent on all of us to take control and become ""we"". The digit lords are the ""they"" people usually refer to. In the current system, there are digit lords, digit dealers, and digit addicts. In the Bitcoin system, addicts detox, dealers build detoxing tools, and no one is a digit lord. And brings us back to Jeff’s statement there is only we in the Bitcoin system!Congratulations on reaching the end of this article!

It’s 2024. Donald Trump has just clinched the election again, Bitcoin’s hit a new all-time high, inflation’s running hotter than the DeLorean’s flux capacitor, and everyone’s wondering, “What’s next?” As we all wrestle with the wild pace of history, there’s a flash in the sky, a crackle of lightning, and who should appear but Doc Brown himself. He hops out of the DeLorean, eyes wild and hair wilder, and says, “Forget sports almanacs, Marty! We’re going back – not to 1985, but to 2009, before anyone knew what a Bitcoin even was!”Yes, we’d all love to jump into that time machine and zip back to January 3, 2009 – the day Bitcoin’s genesis block was mined. Get it cheap, stockpile our wallets, and maybe even tuck a few under the couch cushions. But here’s the catch: Bitcoin doesn’t work that way. Its greatest strength? ""Everyone gets the price they deserve."" No one gets a free ride, and Bitcoin doesn’t have a rewind button – only a road forward.Doc Brown was onto something when he said, “Roads? Where we're going, we don’t need roads!” The path Bitcoin forges isn’t one of shortcuts or regrets. It’s a one-way journey to the future, with a price tag that keeps moving forward. It doesn’t care if we wish we’d started at $1 or $100 – it’s relentless, and that’s the point.Today, people freeze at the current price, haunted by unit bias, plagued by a “missed opportunity” that exists only in hindsight. But Bitcoin’s value doesn’t lie in a magical price point of the past; it lies in the present – in its steady march into the future. And standing on the sidelines, waiting for some impossible dip or trying to summon 2009 prices, is like being Biff: always scheming, always missing the point.If Marty learned anything, it’s that you can’t stand on the fence and hope things will work out. Biff, forever clueless and out of touch, is the perfect example of what happens when you miss the future staring you in the face. Imagine Biff in 2009 – he’d be mocking Bitcoin, laughing it off, and then spending decades regretting every lost satoshi. Don’t be a Biff. Don’t let hindsight or wishful thinking stop you from joining the future.We all wish we’d snagged Bitcoin at the price of a coffee, but that DeLorean opportunity is long gone. Doc Brown would tell us the same thing he told Marty: “The future is what you make of it, so make it a good one.”So, next time you’re looking at Bitcoin’s price today, heart pounding like you’re about to hit 88 mph, remember: there’s no going back to 2009. There’s just the next block, the next satoshi, and the next step forward. Where Bitcoin’s going, we don’t need time travel – we just need the courage to act. And like Doc would say, when it comes to Bitcoin, where we’re going, we don’t need regrets.This article is a Take.

Of the reported assets, the Foundation holds 82.7% in ADA, 10.1% in Bitcoin, and the remainder in USD liquidity. Given the recent market rally, the value of the Foundation’s Bitcoin holdings has reached an estimated $103.7 million. Cardano Foundation Assets (Source: Cardano Foundation) Cardano Foundation CEO Frederik Gregaard described the report as a testament to Cardano’s open-source philosophy. He emphasized that transparency is at the core of the Foundation’s mission, not just as a concept but as a foundational principle it fully embraces. The Cardano Foundation plans to release its Activity Report for 2024 in the first quarter of 2025. This report will offer a comprehensive overview of the Foundation’s initiatives and achievements over the past year. Expenses The report outlines that the Foundation allocated roughly $19.22 million to three key areas: operational resilience, education, and adoption. An additional $4.55 million supported central operational costs to enhance the Foundation’s capacity and advance significant initiatives. In the area of Operational Resilience, the Foundation spent $2.12 million to strengthen Cardano’s infrastructure, positioning it as a reliable component for institutional-grade operations. This investment has helped the Cardano network achieve over 2,000 consecutive days of uninterrupted operation. Additional achievements included launching a block producer, refined stake pool delegation, and ongoing network monitoring. Cardano Foundation Expenses (Source: Cardano Foundation) The Foundation allocated $4.18 million to its educational initiatives. These funds supported blockchain discussions, research, regulatory clarification, and educational events to inform and engage diverse stakeholders on the fundamentals and potential of blockchain technology. However, the largest share of expenses, totaling $12.92 million, went toward driving Cardano’s adoption. This funding promoted the development of use cases that demonstrate Cardano’s versatility. It also contributed to community tools such as an identity wallet and Ledger Sync, which aim to enhance user experience and utility. Earnings Staking rewards generated by delegating its ADA serve as the Foundation’s primary income source. In 2023, the Foundation’s 668.8 million ADA holdings produced staking rewards totaling 20.9 million ADA, representing a 3.1% return. According to its Delegation Strategy, the Cardano Foundation prioritizes delegating to stake pools that benefit the blockchain network’s ecosystem rather than maximizing financial returns.

This lack of consistent alignment is evident in recent price movements, with BTC reaching new highs toward $90,000 as gold prices declined. This trend suggests that investors favor BTC over traditional safe-haven assets like gold. A key driver of this shift is the belief that a second term for Trump could provide regulatory clarity, fueling growth for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.

Learn why SOL is favored over Bitcoin and Ethereum.The postSolana Outperforms Bitcoin and Ethereum – Market Analysts Predict $600 Milestone in This Bull Runappeared first onCryptonews."," A recent survey by MV Capital suggests that Solana (SOL) is poised to outperform both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in the upcoming market cycle. Analysts predict that Solana could reach a peak of $600, marking a fourfold increase from its current levels around $217.46.  This bullish sentiment reflects optimism among institutional investors, who see Solana’s upside potential as particularly strong. The survey, which gathered insights from 76 liquid and venture capital allocators in the crypto space, revealed that over 30% of respondents expect Solana to be a top performer in this cycle. This positions Solana as a consensus long-term bet, driven by factors such as institutional confidence, potential regulatory shifts, and emerging sectors like AI and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN). Solana Gains Momentum Amid Political Support and ETF Potential Solana’s growth prospects are bolstered by political backing for cryptocurrencies, especially with Donald Trump’s recent pro-crypto stance. Trump has expressed strong support for Bitcoin and digital assets, calling himself the “Bitcoin President,” fueling market expectations for potential deregulation over the next four years. A Solana-specific regulatory change could be the approval of a Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. In July, Cboe proposed listing Solana ETFs by VanEck and 21Shares. Although the SEC has yet to approve this, a crypto-friendly chairman in Trump’s administration could accelerate the process, significantly boosting Solana’s visibility and liquidity.  Benefits of Potential Solana ETF:  Increased market visibility Enhanced liquidity Stronger appeal to retail and institutional investors    A favorable regulatory climate and potential Solana ETF approval have drawn considerable institutional interest, positioning Solana as an attractive long-term investment. Emerging Sectors and Memecoin Mania Drive Growth Solana is also seeing a surge in economic activity from emerging sectors. Survey participants highlighted three areas expected to thrive: AI-related tokens, DePIN, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Notably, 43% of respondents favored AI tokens, with 14.3% showing confidence in DePIN, an infrastructure model that aims to decentralize physical networks. Additionally, Solana’s ecosystem has benefited from a spike in memecoin trading. Noteworthy performers include Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), which rapidly achieved a $400 million market cap within a week. Pump.fun, Solana’s prominent meme coin trading platform, has also generated $100 million in revenue within seven months, marking it as the fastest-growing protocol by revenue growth in crypto history. This surge in activity has bolstered Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL), reaching a two-year high of over 42 million SOL in October, a 13% month-over-month increase. In contrast, Ethereum’s TVL has remained relatively stable at 17.7 million ETH, showcasing Solana’s dynamic growth in the current market environment. Solana Breaks Out: Bullish Momentum Targets $230 After Triangle Pattern Reversal Solana is currently exhibiting bullish momentum after breaking out of a descending triangle pattern. The price has surpassed a previous double top at $215, a signal of potential trend reversal. Additionally, a bullish engulfing candle, followed by another bullish bar, suggests further upward movement. Currently, Solana’s price has crossed above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), now at $208.53, which provides robust support. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 59.73, indicating moderate bullish momentum with room for further gains.  Conclusion: Solana’s breakout from the descending triangle, paired with supportive technical indicators, signals a likely push toward higher resistance levels. A sustained move above $225 could propel the price to $230 and beyond, as bullish momentum strengthens.

Crypto News,Russian Expert: Bitcoin Price Growth Will Continue Until January,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-expert-bitcoin-price-growth-will-continue-until-january/,"A Russian expert has claimed that Bitcoin price growth will continue until January, with BTC advocates continuing to look forward to President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration.The postRussian Expert: Bitcoin Price Growth Will Continue Until Januaryappeared first onCryptonews."," A Russian expert has claimed that Bitcoin price growth will continue until January, with BTC advocates continuing to look forward to President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. Speaking to Russia’s Business Gazeta, Leonid Delitsyn, an analyst at the investment firm Finam, said American investors were leading BTC’s charge toward $100,000. Bitcoin Price Growth Will Continue Until Trump Takes Office, Expert Claims Delitsyn said that crypto traders now had “expectations” that Trump would “ease regulations in the cryptocurrency market” in January.  Bitcoin soared to a record high above $81,000 on expectations that cryptocurrencies will boom in a favorable regulatory environment following the election of Donald Trump as US president and pro-crypto candidates to Congress https://t.co/Bme4dNNZOU pic.twitter.com/gZ7GzQ0yyW— Reuters (@Reuters) November 11, 2024   “If the rules of buying on expectations also apply this time around, then this growth driver will not run out of steam until January, when Trump takes office.” Leonid Delitsyn, Analyst, Finam Delitsyn said the latest spurt of price growth is being sparked by the US election and indications that the Republican Party will gain a majority in the House of Representatives. This will help Trump’s policies avoid “resistance” in the American parliamentary system, Delitsyn added. According to the expert, BTC price growth usually slows quickly “when all the hopes of crypto investors are realized.” Dima (surname withheld for privacy reasons) is a crypto investor and resident of the Russian city of Saratov. He told Cryptonews.com earlier this week that he and his fellow crypto-trading friends felt “positive” about their positions. On November 12, Dima told Cryptonews.com that his “positivity” was “undiminished” as BTC continued to climb toward the $90,000 mark.  President-elect Donald Trump has started to choose the people who he wants to implement his “America first” policies on the border, trade, economy and more.From Susie Wiles to Marco Rubio, take a look at some of the people Trump is picking or set to pick https://t.co/koF48DX3in— Bloomberg (@business) November 12, 2024  Medium-term Growth on Cards? Meanwhile, Nikita Stepanov, another Finam analyst told the same media outlet that Trump’s election victory “could have a positive effect on the cryptocurrency market in the medium term.” Stepanov said that the President-elect was serious about his plans to use crypto to “solve the problem of US national debt.”   Bitcoin’s recent surge has captured headlines, but analysts argue that the primary driver is not the U.S. presidential election outcome. #Bitcoin #Halvinghttps://t.co/2cMXxMTJDu— Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 12, 2024  Elsewhere, other Russian financial experts urged caution. Moskva24 quoted Lazar Badalov, Associate Professor at the Peoples’ Friendship University of Russia (RUDN)’s Faculty of Economics, as stating that “sharp rises” in BTC prices are “usually followed” by “a serious fall.” He said:  “In my opinion, the current situation is no exception. The period of decline will come. The only question is this: How big will Bitcoin’s new all-time high be? People are also curious to learn about how quickly this will happen. After that, the market will begin to turn around. There is no doubt about that.”  While he admitted that “optimism” was now prevalent in the Bitcoin markets, he warned that “rumors” were driving price growth. The academic explained:  “Currently, a classic situation is developing. People are buying on rumors and will sell on facts. Now investors are simply hoping for a favorable attitude of the new US President towards cryptocurrencies.”  The Peoples’ Friendship University, in Moscow, Russia. (Source: ROMANYEL [CC BY-SA 3.0]) However, Badalov suggested that Trump’s victory and his talk of creating a “national reserve” of Bitcoin had changed the crypto narrative. He said:  “In general, Trump has promised the complete opposite of the [crypto] policies that took hold under President Joe Biden. That is why investors are still optimistic.”  The academic also warned Russian investors that transactions with cryptoassets “carry significant risks.”  “Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile. Accordingly, buying them risks incurring very large losses. A situation may arise when an investor buys Bitcoin at a very high price. Then, at the time of sale, it will lose much of its value, since transactions take time.” Lazar Badalov, Associate Professor, Faculty of Economics, RUDN University  The post Russian Expert: Bitcoin Price Growth Will Continue Until January appeared first on Cryptonews.

Crypto News,"Bitcoin Explodes to $93,000!

Analysts predict six-figure valuations as BTC surpasses silver's market cap. Tariff policies and inflation risks could influence the crypto market further.The postBitcoin Explodes to $93,000! Trump’s Crypto Embrace Fuels Record-Breaking Surge – What’s Next?appeared first onCryptonews."," Bitcoin reached an all-time high (ATH) of $93,000 on Wednesday, marking a dramatic price surge driven by renewed investor confidence linked to President-elect Donald Trump. Bitcoin’s ascent represents a 5.98% increase so far today after setting multiple ATHs throughout the week. Market analysts attribute this climb to the so-called “Trump trade,” with investors anticipating more favorable cryptocurrency regulations under a potential Trump administration. Bitcoin’s ATH: A Trump Trade Triumph? The cryptocurrency market witnessed an unprecedented Bitcoin surge in the wake of Trump’s electoral victory.  The BTC price appreciated by an impressive 32.3% so far this month and an astounding 122% since the start of the year. Source: CoinMarketCap / BTCUSD The unprecedented price movement, largely attributed to the “Trump trade,” reflects investors’ belief that a Trump presidency would support a more accommodating regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies compared to the current administration.  Trump’s public pronouncements on cryptocurrency, including his pledge to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and his stated intent to replace Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, have further bolstered this sentiment.  The expectation of a pro-crypto SEC chair has greatly contributed to the recent Bitcoin price surge. Bitcoin’s Market Cap Ascendancy With its recent price surge, Bitcoin has surpassed silver in market capitalization. Bitcoin’s market cap currently sits at approximately $1.735 trillion, eclipsing silver’s valuation and solidifying its position as a prominent asset class.   Whaaaat! Bitcoin just flipped Silver  pic.twitter.com/qDX9QdZea6— Crypto Banter (@crypto_banter) November 11, 2024  Some market analysts believe Bitcoin could reach a six-figure valuation in the coming months.  Josh Gilbert, a market analyst at eToro, predicts continued momentum, potentially driving the Bitcoin price to $100,000 in the near future.   The people of @eToroAU have spoken! Investors see $BTC hitting 100k this year pic.twitter.com/SthljdptiW— Josh Gilbert (@JoshGilbert_) March 18, 2024  He noted a record daily surge in inflows to Bitcoin ETFs last week, suggesting a renewed wave of investor interest that could trigger a retail buying frenzy reminiscent of the 2021 bull market.  While the overall sentiment around Bitcoin continues to be positive, potential risks loom. Trump’s proposed tariff policies could trigger inflationary pressures, potentially impacting the cryptocurrency market negatively.  Cryptocurrencies are often viewed as a hedge against inflation, thriving in environments with lower interest rates and ample liquidity. If Trump’s tariffs lead to increased inflation and subsequent interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, it could exert downward pressure on Bitcoin and other digital assets. The Political Landscape and Bitcoin’s Future The outcome of the Congressional elections will also play an important role in shaping the future of the crypto market. The balance of power in the House and Senate will influence the legislative agenda and regulatory decisions concerning cryptocurrencies.  Michael McCarthy, chief commercial officer at Moomoo, warns that the potential inflationary impact of Republican policy promises could affect all asset classes, including Bitcoin and gold.  He suggests the possibility of higher interest rates for a longer period, potentially dampening the current market enthusiasm.  The post Bitcoin Explodes to $93,000!

Crypto News,"Metaplanet Reports $28M Bitcoin Gain, Shares Decline","Wed, 13 Nov 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/metaplanet-reports-28m-bitcoin-gain-shares-decline/,"Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has reported a $28 million gain in its Bitcoin holdings, surpassing 1,000 BTC, following a strategic acquisition approach similar to MicroStrategy, despite a slight decline in its stock value.The postMetaplanet Reports $28M Bitcoin Gain, Shares Declineappeared first onCryptonews."," Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has reported a $28M valuation gain in its Bitcoin holdings after its continued investment in the leading cryptocurrency, bringing its total to over 1,000 BTC.  The surge follows a focused acquisition strategy, initiated mid-year, that mirrors the approach of MicroStrategy, a U.S.-based firm known for accumulating large Bitcoin reserves.  This valuation surge places Metaplanet as one of Asia’s prominent Bitcoin corporate holders, surpassing the $64 million investment mark, even as ongoing expenses impact the company’s financials. Despite this gain, Metaplanet’s stock saw a slight decline in trading.  *Metaplanet Releases Q3 Financials & Fair Value of Bitcoin Holdings*Consolidated Financials: https://t.co/NjKVl2c2uHFair Market Value of Bitcoin Holdings: https://t.co/J9mDuWNVGR— Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) November 13, 2024  Metaplanet’s $28M Bitcoin Gain: Is This Asia’s MicroStrategy? Metaplanet’s strategic decision to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset began in May.  The firm aimed to hedge against the declining value of the Japanese yen and mitigate economic pressures from prolonged low interest rates and high government debt.  Metaplanet doubled its BTC holdings in just a few months, hitting 1,018.17 BTC by late October, with cumulative investment nearing $64 million.  Source: X / @gerovich Metaplanet acquired Bitcoin incrementally, securing additional capital through stock issuances and bond offerings, including a recent 10 billion yen loan to finance BTC purchases.  By September’s close, Metaplanet’s total BTC holding stood at 492.82, which expanded by 156 BTC in October to reach its present level.  In October alone, Metaplanet spent around $10 million on Bitcoin, capitalising on a period of crypto market optimism driven by Bitcoin’s rally to $87,000.  While Metaplanet continues to grow its BTC reserves, it simultaneously generates premium income through options trading on its Bitcoin holdings, allowing the firm to boost returns beyond capital appreciation.  本日時点で、メタプラネットのビットコイン保有に関する評価益は42億7千万円に達しました。この評価益は、年初時点での当社の時価総額を上回る金額となっております。As of today, Metaplanet's valuation gain on its Bitcoin holdings is JPY 4.27 billion ($28 million).  This gain is larger… https://t.co/JJ7ce6FJKZ pic.twitter.com/X2XXAltPh4— Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) November 13, 2024  While Metaplanet’s BTC holdings appreciated by $28 million, bringing significant value to its balance sheet, the company has also faced operational challenges that impacted its bottom line.  The firm reported a net operating loss of $2.1 million for the first three quarters of 2024.  Despite a 46.3% revenue increase year-over-year to $1.7 million, gains were offset by rising operational costs in areas such as the hotel business, leading to a total operating loss of 183 million yen ($1.23 million).  Additionally, the company recorded Bitcoin valuation losses in prior periods, although current gains largely offset these earlier impairments. New Performance Indicator Amid Share Price Decline To keep investors informed of its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, Metaplanet has adopted a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) known as “BTC Yield,” inspired by MicroStrategy’s reporting practices.  BTC Yield represents the change in Bitcoin holdings per fully diluted share. With BTC Yield reaching 155.8% in recent quarters, the company views this metric as a way for investors to gauge the alignment of its treasury policy with shareholder value. Despite the rise in Bitcoin holdings, Metaplanet’s share price saw a 5% dip, closing at 1,766 JPY ($11.41) in Asian trading hours.  Source: YahooFinance This reflected investor caution amid mixed earnings reports and significant cryptocurrency market volatility.  Following its consistent acquisitions, Metaplanet has become one of Asia’s top Bitcoin corporate holders and is now the 19th-largest in the world. CEO Simon Gerovich emphasized that the company remains committed to its “Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-only” approach. He reiterated Metaplanet’s intention to continue purchasing Bitcoin as opportunities arise.  As the company pursues further BTC accumulation, Gerovich remarked,   “We intend to continue increasing our Bitcoin holdings through capital market activities and operational income as deemed appropriate.”  The post Metaplanet Reports $28M Bitcoin Gain, Shares Decline appeared first on Cryptonews.

Kiyosaki Plans Bitcoin Buys Up to $100K Mark “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki shared his Bitcoin strategy, emphasizing disciplined accumulation over speculative selling. Kiyosaki, currently holding 73 Bitcoin, plans to continue buying until Bitcoin hits $100,000. He advised investors against chasing quick profits, advocating a systematic buying approach.  YAY:  BITCOIN over $88.000.  I will keep buying more Bitcoin till it passes $100,000.  Then I will stop.  Not a time to get greedy.Always remember….hogs get fat…pigs get slaughtered.   Don’t be a pig.— Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 12, 2024  Kiyosaki’s comments highlight his view of Bitcoin as a long-term asset, reinforcing the idea that consistent purchasing can strengthen the $100K level as a key price milestone.  His support may contribute to short-term price momentum and promote Bitcoin’s appeal as a stable investment choice. Dollar Strengthens as BTC Holds Record Levels Trump’s win has also kept the U.S. dollar near a six-month high, with investors expecting the new administration to pursue tariff cuts and tax reforms.  This has bolstered inflation expectations, pushing U.S. Treasury yields higher. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dipped slightly to $87,105 after briefly touching $89,998 but remains near its peak.  Treasury yields resumed their rise as investors looked ahead to crucial consumer price data on Wednesday https://t.co/U6VqtxK3T6— Bloomberg Economics (@economics) November 12, 2024  As markets await U.S. inflation data, the Federal Reserve’s rate decisions could impact both the dollar and Bitcoin. Faster-than-expected inflation might add to Bitcoin’s volatility, though the long-term outlook remains positive.  With increasing institutional interest and potentially supportive regulations, Bitcoin’s upward trajectory appears set to continue. Bitcoin Eyes Breakout Above $89,600 as Bullish Momentum Builds Bitcoin is trading around $87,700, maintaining its upward momentum but facing resistance near the $89,600 mark. A break above this level could pave the way toward the next resistance at $91,500, with further gains potentially extending to $93,300.   Immediate support lies at $86,000, with additional support levels around $84,700 and $83,200. The 50-day EMA, currently at $83,200, serves as a key trend indicator, providing strong support. The RSI hovers near 62, indicating moderate momentum but leaving room for further buying.  Overall, BTC appears poised for a breakout if it can clear $89,600, though failure to hold above $87,500 might trigger consolidation. Key Insights:  Resistance at $89,600 may trigger gains toward $91,500 and beyond. Support at $86,000 could cushion potential pullbacks. 50-day EMA at $83,200 reinforces the bullish trend direction.  – You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034  Flockerz ($FLOCK) Gaining Momentum with Unique “Vote-to-Earn” Model Flockerz ($FLOCK) is generating buzz in the meme coin market, having raised $1,663,455 out of a target of $1,842,124.

Bitcoin Magazine,Are Retail Investors Behind The Bitcoin Price Surge This Bull Run?,"Sat, 16 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/are-retail-investors-behind-the-bitcoin-price-surge-this-bull-run,Analyzing Bitcoin's current market dynamics to uncover what’s driving the price.,"As Bitcoin once again finds itself in price discovery mode, market watchers and enthusiasts are curious: has retail FOMO set in yet, or is the retail surge we’ve seen in past bull cycles still on the horizon? Using data from active addresses, historical cycles, and various market indicators, we’ll examine where the Bitcoin market currently stands and what it might signal about the near future.Rising InterestOne of the most direct signs of retail interest is the number of new Bitcoin addresses created. Historically, sharp increases in new addresses have often marked the beginning of a bull run as new retail investors flood into the market. In recent months, however, the growth in new addresses hasn’t been as sharp as one might expect. Last year, we saw around 791,000 new addresses created in a single day—a sign of considerable retail interest. In comparison, we now hover significantly lower, although we have recently seen a modest uptick in new addresses.  Figure 1: The number of new addresses on the Bitcoin network has begun to rise.   View Live Chart 🔍Google Trends also reflects this tempered interest. Although searches for “Bitcoin” have been increasing in the past month, they remain far below previous peaks in 2021 and 2017. It seems that retail investors are showing a renewed curiosity but not yet the fervent excitement typical of FOMO-driven markets.  Figure 2: Google searches for ‘Bitcoin’ are also rising but are still relatively low.  Supply ShiftWe are witnessing a slight transition of Bitcoin from long-term holders to newer, shorter-term holders. This shift in supply can hint at the potential start of a new market phase, where experienced holders begin taking profits and selling to newer market participants. However, the overall number of coins transferred remains relatively low, indicating that long-term holders aren’t yet parting with their Bitcoin in significant volumes.  Figure 3: Only a slight increase in bitcoin shifting hands to new holders.   View Live Chart 🔍Historically, during the last bull run in 2020-2021, we saw large outflows from long-term holders to newer investors, which fueled a subsequent price rally. Currently, the shift is only minor, and long-term holders seem largely unfazed by current price levels, opting to hold onto their Bitcoin despite market gains. This reluctance to sell suggests that holders are confident in further upside potential.A Spot-Driven RallyA key aspect of Bitcoin’s latest rally is its spot-driven nature, in contrast to previous bull runs heavily fueled by leveraged positions. Open interest in Bitcoin derivatives has seen only minor increases, which stands in sharp contrast to prior peaks. For instance, open interest was significant before the FTX crash in 2022. A spot-driven market, without excessive leverage, tends to be more stable and resilient, as fewer investors are at risk of forced liquidation.  Figure 4: Open interest has been declining on a macro scale, with only a slight recent increase.   View Live Chart 🔍Big Holders AccumulatingInterestingly, while retail addresses haven’t increased substantially, “whale” addresses holding at least 100 BTC have been rising. Over the past few weeks, wallets with large BTC holdings have added tens of thousands of coins, amounting to billions of dollars in value. This increase signals confidence among Bitcoin’s largest investors that the current price levels have more room to grow, even as Bitcoin reaches all-time highs.  Figure 5: Addresses holding at least 100+ BTC is at the highest value since 2019.   View Live Chart 🔍In past bull cycles, we saw whales exit or decrease their positions near market peaks, a behavior we’re not seeing this time. This trend of accumulation by experienced holders is a strong bullish indicator, as it suggests faith in the market’s long-term potential.ConclusionWhile Bitcoin’s rally to all-time highs has brought renewed attention, we’re not yet seeing the telltale signs of widespread retail FOMO. The subdued retail interest suggests we may be only in the beginning phase of this rally. Long-term holders remain confident, whales are accumulating, and leverage remains modest, all indicators of a healthy, sustainable rally.As we continue into this bull cycle, the market’s structure suggests that the potential for a larger retail-driven surge remains ahead. If this retail interest materializes, it could propel Bitcoin to new heights. For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out a recent YouTube video here: Has Retail Bitcoin FOMO Begun?"
Bitcoin Magazine,The Consensus Conundrum,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-consensus-conundrum,Bitcoin faces a one-of-a-kind leadership problem.,"A lot of consensus-change proposals for bitcoin are on the table at the moment. All of them have good motivations, whether it's scaling UTXO ownership or making self-custody more tractable. I won’t rehash them here, you’re probably already familiar. Some have been actively developed for years.The past two such changes that have been made to bitcoin successfully, Segwit and Taproot, were massive engine-lift-style deployments fraught with drama. There have been smaller changes in bitcoin’s past, like the introduction of locktimes, but for some reason the last two have been kitchen sink affairs.The reality not often talked about by many bitcoin engineers is that up until Taproot, bitcoin’s consensus development was more or less operating under a benevolent dictatorship model. Project leadership went from Satoshi to Gavin to… well, I’ll stop naming names.Core developers will likely quibble with this characterization, but we all know deep down that to a first order approximation that it’s basically true. The “final say” and big ideas were implicitly signed off on by one guy, or maybe a small oligarchy of wizened autists.In many ways there’s really nothing wrong with this - most (all?) major open source projects operate similarly with pretty clear leadership structures. Oftentimes they have benevolent dictators who just “make the call” in times of high-dimensional ambiguity. Everyone knows Guido and Linus and the based Christian sqlite guy.Bitcoin is aesthetically loath to this but the reality, whether we like it or not, is that this is how it worked up until about 2021.Given that, there are three factors that create the CONSENSUS CONUNDRUM facing bitcoin right now:(1) The old benevolent dictators (or high-caste oligarchy) have abdicated their power, leaving a vacuum that shifts the project from “conventional mode of operation” to “novel, never-before-tried” mode: an attempt at some kind of supposedly meritocratic leaderlessness.This change is coupled with the fact that(2) the possible design space for improvements and things to care about in bitcoin is wide open at this point. Do you want vaults? Or more L2s? What about rollups? Or how about a generic computational tool like CAT? Or should we bundle the generic things with applications (CTV + VAULT) to make sure they really work?The problem is that all of these are valid opinions. They all have merit, both in terms of what to focus on and how to get to the end goal. There really isn’t a clear “correct” design pattern.(3) A final factor that makes this situation poisonous is that faithfully pursuing, fleshing out, building, “doing the work” of presenting a proposal IS REALLY REALLY TIME CONSUMPTIVE AND MIND MELTING.Getting the demos, specs, implementation, and ""marketing"" material together is a long grind that takes years of experience with Core to even approach.I was well paid to do this fulltime for years, and the process left me disgusted with the dysfunction and having very little desire to continue contributing. I think this is a common feeling.A related myth is that businesses will do something analogous to aid the process. The idea that businesses will build on prospective forks is pretty laughable. Most bitcoin companies have a ton on their backlog, are fighting for survival, and have basically no one dedicated to R&D. The have a hard enough time integrating features that actually make it in.Many of the ones who do have the budget for R&D are shitcoin factories that don’t care about bitcoin-specific upgrades.I’ve worked for some of the rare companies that care about bitcoin and do have the money for this kind of R&D, and even then the resources are not sufficient to build a serious product demo on top of 1 of N speculative softforks that may never happen.---This kind of situation is why human systems evolve leadership hierarchies. In general, to progress in a situation like this someone needs to be in a position to say “alright, after due consideration we’re doing X.” Of course what makes this seem intractable is that the Bitcoin mythology dictates (rightly) that clear leadership hierarchies are how you wind up, in the limit, with the Fed.Sure, bitcoin can just never change again in any meaningful way (""ossify""). But at this point that almost certainly resigns it to yet another financial product that can only be accessed with the benefit of a large institution.If you grant that bitcoin should probably keep tightening its rules for more and better functionality, but that we should go ""slow and steady,"" I think there are issues with that too.Because another factor that isn’t talked about is that as bitcoin rises in price, and as nation-states start buying in size, the rules will be harder to change. So inaction — not deciding — is actually a very consequential decision.I do not know how this resolves.—There’s another uncomfortable subject I want to touch on: where the power actually lies.The current mechanism for changing bitcoin hinges on what Core developers will merge. This of course isn’t official policy, but it’s the unintended reality. Other less technically savvy actors (like miners and exchanges) have to pick some indicator to pay attention to that tells them what changes are safe and when they are coming. They have little ability or interest to size these things up for themselves, or do the development necessary to figure them out.My Core colleagues will bristle at this characterization. They’ll say “we’re just janitors! we just merge what has consensus!” And they’re not being disingenuous in saying that. But they’re also not acknowledging that historically, that is how consensus changes have operated. This is something that everyone knows semi-consciously but doesn’t really want to own.Core devs saying “yes” and clicking merge has been a necessary precursor every time. And right now none of the Core devs are paying attention to the soft fork conversations - sort of understandable, there’s a bunch to do in bitcoin.But let’s be honest here, a lot of the work happening in Core has been sort of secondary to bitcoin’s realization. Mempool work is interesting, but the whole model is more or less upside down anyway because it’s based on altruism. For-profit darkpools and accelerators seem inevitable to me, although that could be argued. Much of the mempool work is rooted in support for Lightning, which is pretty obviously not going to solve the scaling problem.Sure, encrypted P2P connections are great, but what’s even the point if we can’t get on-chain ownership to a level beyond essentially requiring the use of an exchange, ecash mint, sidechain, or some other trusted third party?My main complaint is that Core has developed an ivory tower mindset that more or less sneers at people piatching long-run consensus stuff instead of trying to actually engage with the hard problems.And that could have bitcoin fall short of its potential.—I don’t know what the solution to any of this is. I do know that self-custody is totally nervewracking and basically out of the question for casual users, and I do know that bitcoin in its current form will not scale to twice-monthly volume for even 10% of the US, let alone most of the world.The people who don’t acknowledge this, and who want to spend critical time and energy wallowing in the mire of proposing the perfect remix of CTV, are making a fateful choice.Most of the longstanding, fully specified fork proposals active today are totally fine, and conceptually they’d be great additions to bitcoin.Hell, probably a higher block size is safe given features like compactblocks and assumeutxo and eventually utreexo. But that’s another post for another day.---I've gone back and forth about writing a post like this, because I don't have any concrete prescriptions or recommendations. I guess I can only hope that bringing up these uncomfortable observations is some distant precursor to making progress on scaling self-custody.All of these opinions have probably been expressed by @JeremyRubin years ago in his blog. I’m just tired of biting my tongue.Thanks to @rot13maxi and @MsHodl for feedback on drafts of this.This is a guest post by James O'Beirne.

Bitcoin Magazine,Jack Mallers New Video About Bitcoin Scarcity is Right on the Money!,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/jack-mallers-new-video-about-bitcoin-scarcity-is-right-on-the-money,Jack Mallers reveals why Bitcoin isn't just an inflation hedge but the ultimate financial solution—highlighting its unmatched scarcity in a world where everything else multiplies like rabbits. ,"     Follow Mark on X.  Well, well, well—if it isn't Jack Mallers dropping truth bombs like they're going out of fashion! His latest video on Bitcoin scarcity has me more thrilled than a Brit who's just found out the pub's open early.You see, we Brits have a knack for understatement, but when it comes to Bitcoin, subtlety takes a backseat. We often babble on about Bitcoin being an inflation hedge—as if it's some sort of financial umbrella protecting us from the monetary drizzle. But let's cut the crumpets; the real magic lies in its finite supply.In his recent episode of The Money Matters Podcast, streamed live on 11 November 2024, Mallers didn't just hit the nail on the head; he used a sledgehammer. ""Bitcoin is a solution, it is not a hedge,"" he proclaimed, with the kind of conviction you'd expect from someone who's just discovered tea and biscuits.He pointed out the glaringly obvious—yet often overlooked—fact that Bitcoin is the only asset where increased demand doesn't lead to increased supply. If everyone suddenly wants an iPhone, Apple will churn them out faster than you can say ""planned obsolescence."" But if everyone wants Bitcoin? Well, tough biscuits. There's a fixed supply, and that's that.Mallers eloquently stated, ""Bitcoin is the most performant asset in the world because it's the scarcest asset in the world. It's the only asset that demands a higher price for more supply."" It's like trying to get tickets to a sold-out Oasis concert; the more you want them, the more you have to cough up.He also took a delightful jab at those who think Bitcoin is just another cog in the financial machine, correlated to stocks or precious metals. It's as if he's telling us that while the world fiddles with monetary policies like a cat with a ball of yarn, Bitcoin stands unflinchingly firm.Now, I don't know about you, but the idea that Bitcoin is immune to the whims of central banks and governments makes me sleep better at night. Well, that and a good cup of Earl Grey. The finite nature of Bitcoin means it can't be diluted, devalued, or tampered with—unlike my neighbor's opinion on my lawn gnomes.Mallers sums it up brilliantly: ""Bitcoin can change the world because the world cannot change Bitcoin."" It's the financial equivalent of an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object—except, in this case, the object is a decentralized ledger, and the force is our collective realization that scarcity is valuable.So, what's the takeaway here? If you're still treating Bitcoin like an optional side dish rather than the main course, it's time to rethink your financial menu. The scarcity of Bitcoin isn't a bug; it's a feature—a rather splendid one at that.In the grand tapestry of assets, Bitcoin is that elusive thread of gold that doesn't tarnish, doesn't fray, and certainly doesn't multiply just because we fancy a bit more bling. It's high time we recognized Bitcoin not just as a hedge against inflation but as a standalone solution to the age-old problem of value preservation.As for me, I've decided to value two things above all: my time and my Bitcoins. Everything else is just window dressing—or, as we say across the pond, mere fluff.So here's to Jack Mallers for reminding us that sometimes, less truly is more. And if you haven't watched his latest video, do yourself a favor and give it a gander. Just be prepared—you might find yourself nodding along more vigorously than a bobblehead on a bumpy road.Cheers!Watch the video:#Bitcoin can change the world because the world can’t change #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/3WnamG8nL7— Jack Mallers (@jackmallers) November 14, 2024  This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,"No, BlackRock Won’t Ossify Bitcoin","Fri, 15 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/no-blackrock-wont-necessarily-ossify-bitcoin,"Shinobi argued that the surge of institutional bitcoin adoption will lead to premature ossification of the Bitcoin protocol. While I share this concern to an extent, I am less convinced this is necessarily true.","     Follow Aaron on Nostr or X.  In his Take from Wednesday, Shinobi argued that the surge of institutional bitcoin adoption will lead to premature ossification of the Bitcoin protocol. While I share his concern to an extent, I am less convinced this is necessarily true.Bitcoin is inherently a permissionsless system. For protocol changes specifically, it “just” requires users to upgrade their software. And when it comes to deploying soft forks, it really only needs a majority of miners to upgrade. (This is admittedly a simplification for the sake of brevity, but I’d say it’s still “true enough” to state it this way.)Miners will for the most part follow economic incentives. If a protocol upgrade makes Bitcoin (say) more scalable or more private, there is actually good reason to think this would make Bitcoin more valuable, which in turn means there is good reason to think miners will activate the upgrade.Even in an extreme scenario where a soft fork occurs through a user activated soft fork (UASF) that splits the blockchain, and even if in this scenario the institutions prefer the non-upgraded version of the chain (this is the scenario Shinobi is ultimately envisioning), it’s not obvious to me that the non-upgraded chain would “win”.Just owning lots of bitcoin does not give you a “say” on which side of a chain split is more valuable. Initially, everyone receives coins on both sides. Only if you’re willing to buy or sell these coins (eg.: “dump” coins on one side of the split to get more coins on the other side) does your economic weight matter. But this means you have to take a risk: skin in the game.Would big institutions really be willing to bet everything they own on the version of the protocol without the upgrade? That’s a big assumption to make.This article is a Take. Opinions expressed are entirely the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine."
Bitcoin Magazine,How to Use & Store Bitcoin Safely,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/how-to-use-store-bitcoin-safely,"A step-by-step List of Essential Tips for Secure Online Transactions, powered by Stake.","Ever since its 2009 development by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has become foundational to the cryptocurrency and fintech landscape. As the first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has driven significant growth in blockchain technology, becoming the most visible and widely adopted coin on the market. With the ability to conduct seamless transactions on the blockchain, Bitcoin has been adopted as legal tender in some countries and embraced worldwide for a variety of uses.Today, Bitcoin is used by people globally for various services. Notably, Bitcoin has gained adoption not only as legal currency in El Salvador but also for every day transactions—whether trading a pizza from Papa John’s or depositing funds at online casinos and sports betting websites.Bitcoin’s value lies in its enhanced privacy, cryptographic security, and the development of encrypted wallets that ensure safe transactions on a global scale. Let’s dive into how Bitcoin works, how to use it, and the best ways to keep it secure:What is Bitcoin (BTC) & How Does it Work?Despite being around for more than a decade, newcomers may still wonder, “what is bitcoin?” Simply put, Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates independently of any central bank. Instead of relying on a traditional financial institution, Bitcoin transactions are verified by networked computers through a process known as mining, which involves solving complex mathematical problems. Once mined, Bitcoin can be transferred directly to others or used for purchases with bitcoin-accepting vendors, with each transaction recorded on a public ledger—the blockchain.This decentralized, peer-to-peer system ensures that all Bitcoin transactions are transparent yet pseudonymous. Even though each transaction is publicly available on the blockchain, the identities of the transacting parties can remain private.How to Use Bitcoin OnlineBefore first buying and using bitcoin, you will need to set up a wallet in which to store it. Here's a simple guide to start using Bitcoin:Set Up a Wallet: Choose a secure Bitcoin wallet for your needs. You’ll need both a public key (like an account number) for receiving funds and a private key (like a password) for authorizing transactions. Many hot wallets and cold wallets are available, each with its pros and cons for different users.Find Vendors that Accept Bitcoin: Many online services and products now accept Bitcoin, although some may only accept other cryptocurrencies. Once you’ve found a vendor, you can use your wallet to send Bitcoin directly for goods or services.Send Bitcoin to Other Users: Bitcoin transfers are similar to traditional bank transfers, though they remain independent of banks. Ask the recipient for their wallet address, then transfer funds directly to their wallet.How to Store Bitcoin SafelyWhen using Bitcoin, securing your funds is critical. Here are key wallet types and best practices for safe Bitcoin storage:Hot Wallets: These are digital wallets connected to the internet, such as mobile or web apps. Hot wallets are convenient for frequent transactions but are more vulnerable to cyber threats. When using hot wallets, consider diversifying to reduce risk.Cold Wallets: Cold wallets, like hardware wallets, are offline storage solutions, ideal for long-term holdings. These wallets are disconnected from the internet, making them less accessible to potential hackers. While they’re more secure, they can be less convenient for immediate transactions.Seed Phrases and Private Keys: When you set up a wallet, you’ll often receive a seed phrase—a recovery phrase that enables you to restore your funds if you lose access to your wallet. It’s essential to keep both your seed phrase and private key secure and offline. The public key can be shared with anyone for receiving Bitcoin, but the private key must remain private to ensure the safety of your funds.Why You Should Use BitcoinThere are many reasons why people choose to use Bitcoin, and here are some of the most popular benefits:Privacy and Decentralization: Bitcoin’s independence from central banks and financial institutions allows users to make private, pseudonymous transactions. This feature makes it an appealing choice for those looking to protect their financial privacy.Global Payment Solution: Bitcoin allows users to conduct transactions across borders without worrying about exchange fees. You’ll only need to pay a small transaction fee on crypto exchanges, with no need to exchange fiat currencies like dollars to euros.Wider Acceptance: With increased adoption, Bitcoin is now accepted by a growing number of companies and online platforms. Whether it’s for gaming on sites like Stake.com or making everyday purchases, Bitcoin’s utility continues to expand.Bitcoin: The Future of FinanceBitcoin offers a decentralized, secure method of conducting transactions that emphasizes user control, privacy, and a simplified financial process. As Bitcoin continues to grow in use and adoption, learning how to use and store it safely has never been more critical. Following these best practices can help you protect your assets and enjoy the benefits of this revolutionary digital currency."
Bitcoin Magazine,A Nation of Individuals? ,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/a-nation-of-individuals-,"The following is an excerpt from The Satoshi Papers, an open debate on money, state, and society in a Bitcoin world, edited by Natalie Smolenski.","It is the prospect of the sovereign individual that seems to most trouble the nation-state today. This odd threat perception has been the outgrowth of a political genealogy that, in the generations since the American Revolution, has increasingly come to equate the state with society while constellating the individual as the enemy of both. This equation would have been profoundly disconcerting to the founders of the American republic, who called forth a new national project precisely to preclude the abuses of an entrenched and predatory overclass—an aristocracy—that deemed itself the rightful custodian, in perpetuity, of the fate and best interests of a people. The political question animating America’s founders was, therefore: How can a people self-govern without creating a hereditary class of governors? How can sufficient tension, if not conflict, remain between state and society that the rule of law is preserved without becoming a prison?The founders devised an ingenious solution to this problem based on a revolutionary premise: That the rights of the individual, not those of the state, are fundamental for a free society.[1] In other words, people have rights; governments do not have rights. Governments have powers, but only those powers that are explicitly delegated to them by the people they represent. Put more precisely, the people have the totality of enumerated and unenumerated rights, while the state has only those powers explicitly enumerated. Any actions taken by agents of the state outside of their enumerated powers are a usurpation of the people’s rights. The people must safeguard these explicit limits and can take the enumerated powers of the state back at any time.In other words, the American founders reversed the dominant political assumptions in their cultural world: It was not the people who had to prove that they were deserving of rights, that they were innocent before the law, or that they had cleared themselves of inherited obligations to the state. Rather, it was the state that bore the burden of proof: That it was worthy of trust; that it had the power to take a particular action; that any person or entity was guilty under the law; or that its war powers should be exercised with the people’s blood and treasure. Concretely, this meant that during the era of the US Constitutional Convention, when the debate between the Federalists and Anti-Federalists raged, a formative consensus emerged that the American state would have no power of its own, no money of its own, and no army of its own. The American Constitution stipulated that all of these things would be effectively on loan from the people, in whom true sovereignty resided.   But things have changed profoundly since the Constitution was ratified. Not only did America establish a standing army quickly thereafter; that army has been engaged in almost unceasing warfare—over a hundred conflicts both foreign and domestic, declared and undeclared—since that time. While most Americans today would likely be familiar with the large-scale conflicts in which their nation has participated—the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, and two world wars, for example—they probably would be surprised by the majority of the wars in which the United States has been involved. During the nineteenth century, those wars were fought mostly against American Indian tribes as part of the push to colonize the West, while during the twentieth century they were waged predominantly against socialist and communist movements around the world. Twenty-first-century conflicts, in turn, have been prosecuted under the banner of the war on terror and, more recently, the containment of adversary nations. Although the Constitution grants Congress the sole power to declare war, in practice, Congress has only declared war in a few major conflicts: The War of 1812, wars against Mexico and Spain, and wars against particular belligerents in the First and Second World Wars. The rest have been waged through some form of unilateral executive action, whether by presidential decree or by the determination of military officers.Just as the US government now seems to have its own army, it seems to have its own money. In 1913, Congress passed the Sixteenth Amendment, giving it the right to levy permanent income taxes on the American people; estate taxes, gift taxes, capital gains taxes, and corporate taxes followed soon thereafter, while other permanent forms of taxation have been introduced in the decades since. This money has since come to be widely referred to as “government revenue” rather than “the people’s money.” But the federal government does not confine its spending to the people’s money; rather, it borrows extensively, supporting a ballooning administrative state whose agencies are so numerous and ill-defined that there is no authoritative reference for exactly how many there are. The Federal Register, the Online Federal Register, the US Government Manual, the Sourcebook of United States Executive Agencies, the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, FOIA.gov, and USA.gov all list widely differing numbers and definitions of agencies.[2],[3] These agencies function as both rulemaking and rule-enforcing bodies, collapsing all three branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial) into one in their own operations. This eliminates the checks and balances that the authors of the Constitution put in place to constrain the power of the state, subjecting the American people to a growing thicket of laws that they have had no part in making and have no electoral capacity to alter or repeal. As a result, an illusion is created that the government has its own power.But while military conflict, taxation, and bureaucratic rule are all visible manifestations of the power of the state, they are underpinned by a platform that seems so normal and ubiquitous today that it largely goes unnoticed: A financial system in which central banks issue and manage the supply and price of unredeemable fiat currencies. These currencies serve as the base money that commercial banks, in turn, use as reserve assets to make loans. Commercial banks and central banks around the world form a network of financial intermediaries who share with each other information about every transaction that passes through their networks—which is also shared with the military, intelligence, and policing agencies of governments and intergovernmental organizations worldwide. Government’s gaze into the economic activity of every person and organization anywhere in the world is effectively unconstrained by any privacy laws or constitutional provisions regarding search and seizure of assets. This alliance between banking power and policing power took hold during the early twentieth century in what can be called the Banker Revolution—a revolution so successful that few are even aware it happened.The Satoshi Papers, a project by The Texas Bitcoin Foundation and edited by Natalie Smolenski, will be available for pre-order on November 19th in paper back and limited Library edition.[1] Thomas Jefferson’s original draft of the Declaration of Independence read “We hold these truths to be sacred & undeniable; that all men are created equal & independent [emphasis added], that from that equal creation they derive rights inherent & inalienable, among which are the preservation of life, & liberty, & the pursuit of happiness.” See Thomas Jefferson, “Image 1 of Thomas Jefferson, June 1776, Rough Draft of the Declaration of Independence,” Library of Congress, https://www.loc.gov/resource/mtj1.001_0545_0548/?sp=1.[2] Clyde Wayne Crews, “How Many Federal Agencies Exist?” Forbes, July 5, 2017, https://www.forbes.com/sites/waynecrews/2017/07/05/how-many-federal-agencies-exist-we-cant-drain-the-swamp-until-we-know/?sh=535830391aa2.[3] Molly Fischer, “What Is a Federal Agency?” Federal Agency Directory, Louisiana State University Libraries, March 28, 2011, https://web.archive.org/web/20130518150541/http://www.lib.lsu.edu/gov/fedagencydef.pdf."

Yes, the orange wonder coin that goes up, down, and all-around faster than a politician’s promises during election season.In 8 years:🏡 Median 🇺🇸 home price in #BTC = -99% 🥇2016: 664 BTC2024: 4.8 BTC  💵 Median 🇺🇸 home price in $USD = +50% 😱2016: $288K2024: $434KCould 1 #Bitcoin buy your dream home in 2028? 👀 pic.twitter.com/Op4NfrHUhG— Bitcoin Magazine Pro (@BitcoinMagPro) November 14, 2024  Let’s Talk Numbers, Shall We?In 2016, if you had 664 BTC burning a hole in your pocket, you could swap it for a median U.S. home. By 2020, that figure had plummeted to a much tidier 45 BTC. And now, in the grand year of 2024, a mere 4.8 BTC could snag you a place to call your own. At this rate, we’re only a few years away from buying a house with the change down the back of Satoshi’s metaphorical sofa.Let’s marvel at this for a moment: as house prices in fiat terms continue their relentless climb—like an escalator with no off switch—Bitcoin’s purchasing power has been heading in the opposite direction. It’s not just holding its own against inflation; it’s laughing in inflation’s face, stealing its lunch money, and then inviting it to watch while it buys a house.A Glimmer of Hope in a Housing CrisisFor millennials, Gen Z, and the generations to come, the dream of homeownership has often felt like trying to catch smoke with bare hands. Wages are stagnant, the cost of living is skyrocketing, and central banks seem to be in a perpetual money-printing competition. But Bitcoin offers a way out. It’s not just a currency; it’s a lifeline—a savings instrument that actually rewards you for your discipline and foresight.The Bitcoin Homeowner’s PlaybookImagine saving up for a down payment in Bitcoin rather than fiat currency. While the dollar in your savings account loses purchasing power faster than an ice cream cone in the sun, your Bitcoin nest egg could be growing—not just in value, but in what it can buy. At the current pace, we’re hurtling towards a future where a single Bitcoin might well buy you a house, a car, and possibly even the white picket fence thrown in for good measure.And here’s the kicker: the rapid decrease in the number of Bitcoins needed to purchase a house isn’t just a fluke. It’s a reflection of Bitcoin’s deflationary nature and its growing adoption as a global store of value. When priced in Bitcoin, houses are getting cheaper. When priced in dollars, they’re getting more expensive. It doesn’t take a financial wizard to figure out which one makes more sense to save in.A Word of Caution (and Optimism)Of course, Bitcoin is not without its volatility. There will be days when the price moves faster than a caffeinated squirrel. But for those with a long-term view, the trend is clear: Bitcoin is the best savings instrument humanity has ever seen.So, to all the young families and would-be homeowners out there, take heart. The dream of owning your own home isn’t dead—it’s just been reimagined. The answer isn’t in working harder or saving more in a currency that loses value by the day. The answer is Bitcoin.And one day soon, when you’re sitting on the porch of your very own house, bought with a single Bitcoin, you’ll raise a glass and say, “Cheers, Satoshi. You made this possible.”Now, where’s that Bitcoin wallet?This article is a Take. Opinions expressed are entirely the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine."
Bitcoin Magazine,ColliderScript: A $50M Bitcoin Covenant With No New Opcodes,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/colliderscript-a-50m-bitcoin-covenant-with-no-new-opcodes,How covenants can be built on Bitcoin today with no softforks (for an outrageously expensive set up price) using hash collisions. By Andrew Poelstra from Blockstream.,"While the last year or two have seen a number of proposals for covenant-proposing extensions to Bitcoin, there has always been a suspicion among experts that covenants may be possible without any extensions. Evidence for this has come in two forms: an expanding repertoire of previously-thought-impossible computations in Script (culminating in the BitVM's project to implement every RISC-V opcode), and a series of ""near-misses"" by which Bitcoin developers have found ways that covenants would have been possible, if not for some obscure historical quirk of the system.Ethan Heilman, Avihu Levy, Victor Kobolov and I have developed a scheme which proves this suspicion was well founded. Our scheme, ColliderScript, enables covenants on Bitcoin today, under fairly reasonable cryptographic assumptions and at a probable cost around 50 million dollars per transaction (plus some hardware R&D).Despite the outlandish costs to use ColliderScript, setting it up is very cheap, and doing so (alongside an ordinary spending mechanism, using Taproot to separate the two) just might save your coins in case a quantum computer shows up out of nowhere and blows up the system.No doubt many readers, after reading these claims, are raising one eyebrow to the sky. By the time you are done reading this article, the other one will be just as high.CovenantsThe context of this discussion, for those unfamiliar, is that Bitcoin has a built-in programming language, called Bitcoin Script, which is used to authorize the spending of coins. In its earliest days, Script contained a rich set of arithmetic opcodes which could be used to implement arbitrary computations. But in the summer of 2010, Satoshi disabled many of these in order to quash a series of serious bugs. (Returning to the pre-2010 version of Script is the goal of the Great Script Restoration Project; OP_CAT is a less ambitious proposal in the same direction.) The idea of covenants -- transactions which use Script to control the quantity and destination of their coins -- didn't appear for several more years, and the realization that these opcodes would've been sufficient to implement covenants didn't come until even later. By that point, the community was too large and cautious to simply ""re-enable"" the old opcodes in the same way that they'd been disabled.Covenants are hypothetical Script constructions that would allow users to control not only the conditions under which coins are spent, but also their destination. This is the basis for many would-be constructions on Bitcoin, from vaults and rate-limited wallets, to new fee-market mechanisms like payment pools, to less-savory constructions like distributed finance and MEV. Millions of words have been spent debating the desirability of covenants and what they would do to the nature of Bitcoin. In this article I will sidestep this debate, and argue simply that covenants are possible on Bitcoin already; that we will eventually discover how they are possible (without great computational cost or questionable cryptographic assumptions); and that our debate about new extensions to Bitcoin shouldn't be framed as though individual changes will be the dividing line between a covenant-less or covenant-ful future for Bitcoin.HistoryOver the years, a tradition developed of finding creative ways to do non-trivial things even with a limited Script. The Lightning Network was one instance of this, as were less widely-known ideas like probabilistic payments or collision bounties for hash functions. Obscure edge cases, like the SIGHASH_SINGLE bug or the use of public key recovery to obtain a ""transaction hash"" within the Script interpreter, were noticed and explored, but nobody ever found a way to make them useful. Meanwhile, Bitcoin itself evolved to be more tightly-defined, closing many of these doors. For example, Segwit eliminated the SIGHASH_SINGLE bug and explicitly separated program data from witness data; Taproot got rid of public key recovery, which had provided flexibility at the cost of potentially undermining security for adaptor signatures or multisignatures.Despite these changes, Script hacking continued, as did the belief among die-hards that somehow, some edge-case might be found that would enable covenant support in Bitcoin. In the early 2020s, two developments in particular made waves. One was my own discovery that signature-based covenants hadn't died with public key recovery, and that in particular, if we had even a single disabled opcode back -- OP_CAT -- this would be enough for a fairly efficient covenant construction. The other was BitVM, a novel way to do large computations in Script across multiple transactions, which inspired a tremendous amount of research into basic computations within single transactions.These two developments inspired a lot of activity and excitement around covenants, but they also crystallized our thinking about the fundamental limitations of Script. In particular, it seemed as though covenants might be impossible without new opcodes, since transaction data was only ever fed into Script through 64-byte signatures and 32-byte public keys, while the opcodes supporting BitVM could only work with 4-byte objects. This divide was termed ""Small Script"" and ""Big Script"", and finding a bridge between the two became synonymous (in my mind, at least) with finding a covenant construction.Functional Encryption and PIPEsIt was also observed that, with a bit of moon math, it might be possible to do covenants entirely within signatures themselves, without ever leaving Big Script. This idea was articulated by Jeremy Rubin in his paper FE'd Up Covenants, which described how to implement covenants using a hypothetical crypto primitive called functional encryption. Months later, Misha Komorov proposed a specific scheme called PIPEs which appears to make this hypothetical idea a reality. This is an exciting development, though it suffers from two major limitations: one is that it involves a trusted setup, meaning that the person who creates the covenant is able to bypass its rules. (This is fine for something like vaults, in which the owner of the coins can be trusted to not undermine his own security; but it is not fine for something like payment pools where the coins in the covenant are not owned by the covenant's creator.) The other limitation is that it involves cutting-edge cryptography with unclear security properties. This latter limitation will fade away with more research, but the trusted setup is inherent to the functional-encryption approach.ColliderScriptThis overview brings us to the current situation: we would like to find a way to implement covenants using the existing form of Bitcoin Script, and we believe that the way to do this is to find some sort of bridge between the ""Big Script"" of transaction signatures and the ""Small Script"" of arbitrary computations. It appears that no opcodes can directly form this bridge (see Appendix A in our paper for a classification of all opcodes in terms of their input and output size). A bridge, if one existed, would be some sort of construction that took a single large object and demonstrated that it was exactly equal to the concatenation of several small objects. It appears, based on our classification of opcodes, that this is impossible.However, in cryptography we often weaken notions like ""exactly equal"", instead using notions like ""computationally indistinguishable"" or ""statistically indistinguishable"", and thereby evade impossibility results. Maybe, by using the built-in cryptographic constructs of Big Script -- hashes and elliptic curve signatures -- and by mirroring them using BitVM constructions in Small Script, we could find a way to show that a large object was ""computationally indistinguishable"" from a series of small ones? With ColliderScript, this is exactly what we did.What does this mean? Well, recall the hash function collision bounty that we mentioned earlier. The premise of this bounty is that anybody who can ""collide"" a hash function, by providing two inputs that have the same hash output, can prove in Big Script that they did so, and thereby claim the bounty. Since the input space of a hash function is much bigger (all bytestrings of up to 520 bytes in size) than the output space (bytestrings of exactly 32 bytes in size), mathematically speaking there must be many many such collisions. And yet, with the exception of SHA1, nobody has found a faster way to find these collisions than by just calling the hash function over and over and seeing if the result matches that of an earlier attempt.This means that, on average, for a 160-bit hash function like SHA1 or RIPEMD160, a user will need to do at least 2^80 work, or a million million million million iterations, to find a collision. (In the case of SHA1, there is a shortcut if the user is able to use inputs of a particular form; but our construction forbids these so for our purposes we can ignore this attack.) This assumes that the user has an effectively infinite amount of memory to work with; with more realistic assumptions, we need to add another factor of one hundred or so.If we imagine that SHA1 and RIPEMD160 can be computed as efficiently as Bitcoin ASICs compute SHA256, then the cost of such a computation would be about the same as 200 blocks, or around 625 BTC (46 million dollars). This is a lot of money, but many people have access to such a sum, so this is possible.To find a triple collision, or three inputs that evaluate to the same thing, would take about 2^110 work, even with very generous assumptions about access to memory. To get this number, we need to add another factor of 16 million to our cost -- bringing our total to over 700 trillion dollars. This is also a lot of money, and one which nobody has access to today.The crux of our construction is as follows: to prove that a series of small objects is equivalent to a single large object, we first find a hash collision between our target object (which we assume can be rerandomized somehow, or else we'd be doing a ""second-preimage search"" rather than a collision search, which would be much much harder) and an ""equivalence tester object"". These equivalence tester objects are constructed in a way that they can be easily manipulated both in Big Script and Small Script.Our construction then checks, in Bitcoin Script, both that our large object collides with our equivalence tester (using exactly the same methods as in the hash-collision bounty) and that our series of small objects collides with the equivalence tester (using complex constructions partially cribbed from the BitVM project, and described in detail in the paper). If these checks pass, then either our small and big objects were the same, or the user found a triple-collision: two different objects which both collide with the tester. By our argument above, this is impossible.ConclusionBridging Small Script and Big Script is the hardest part of our covenant construction. To go from this bridge to an actual covenant, there are a few more steps, which are comparatively easy. In particular, a covenant script first asks the user to sign the transaction using the special ""generator key"", which we can verify using the OP_CHECKSIG opcode. Using the bridge, we break this signature into 4-byte chunks. We then verify that its nonce was also equal to the generator key, which is easy to do once the signature has been broken up. Finally, we use techniques from the Schnorr trick to extract transaction data from the signature, which can then be constrained in whatever way the covenant wants.There are a few other things we can do: Appendix C describes a ring signature construction that would allow coins to be signed by one of a set of public keys, without revealing which one was used. In this case, we use the bridge to break up the public key, rather than the signature. Doing so gives us a significant efficiency improvement relative to the covenant construction, for technical reasons related to Taproot and detailed in the paper.A final application that I want to draw attention to, discussed briefly in Section 7.2 of the paper, is that we can use our covenant construction to pull the transaction hash out of a Schnorr signature, and then simply re-sign the hash using a Lamport signature.Why would we do this? As argued in the above link, Lamport-signing the signature this way makes it a quantum-secure signature on the transaction data; if this construction were the only way to sign for some coins, they would be immune from theft by a quantum computer.Of course, since our construction requires tens of millions of dollars to use, nobody would make this construction the only way to sign for their coins. But there's nothing stopping somebody from adding this construction to their coins, in addition to their existing non-quantum-secure methods of spending.Then, if we woke up tomorrow to find that cheap quantum computers existed which were able to break Bitcoin signatures, we might propose an emergency soft-fork which disabled all elliptic curve signatures, including both Taproot key-spends and the OP_CHECKSIG opcode. This would effectively freeze everybody's coins; but if the alternative were that everybody's coins were freely stealable, maybe it wouldn't make any difference. If this signature-disabling soft-fork were to allow OP_CHECKSIG opcode when called with the generator key (such signatures provide no security anyway, and are only useful as a building block for complex Script constructions such as ours), then users of our Lamport-signature construction could continue to freely spend their coins, without fear of seizure or theft.Of course, they would need to spend tens of millions of dollars to do so, but this is much better than ""impossible""! And we expect and hope to see this cost drop dramatically, as people build on our research.This is a guest post by Andrew Poelstra.

On PricedInBitcoin21.com.I just discovered this website this week, and as a Bitcoin owner, I’ll say it makes me feel better about my financial decisions. As you can see from a quick glance here, the U.S. dollar is now down 86% against Bitcoin on a 5 year basis. Ouch.   Most of the charts are a sea of red.Here’s a look at Bitcoin’s performance against precious metals. I’m glad I don’t own any! From a quick look, we can see they are rapidly going to zero against a superior asset…   At this point in the article you’re either depressed beyond all reason, or reasonably happy, so I figured we’d throw in another chart.   This one shows how fast the value of wages are dropping against BTC. I still get paid in dollars, preferring to roll over my savings, but I have to say, this makes me reconsider the decision…On a 5-year basis, you’ve lost nearly all of your purchasing power. Wow-wee. At least you didn't buy livestock...

Bitcoin Magazine,MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Strategy Won't Work As Well for Other Companies,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/microstrategys-bitcoin-strategy-wont-work-as-well-for-other-companies,I see MicroStrategy's Bitcoin edge disappearing for other firms—this corporate treasury strategy becomes less effective as adoption accelerates. ,"      Look, I am not an expert in public markets, but raising money to buy more Bitcoin seems to be the obvious new alpha for public companies.MicroStrategy pioneered this strategy, and now, 4 years later, it's the most compelling and successful story in corporate finance. Microstrategy has been the best-performing stock in the last 4 years, beating every US company, including NVIDIA. That's crazy, right? All thanks to Bitcoin.I am sure the CFOs of most public companies are now looking at MicroStrategy and analysing how they turned a $1 billion company into a $70 billion empire in just 4 years, and they are thinking about how they can do the same.Here's the playbook:Use Profits, Equity and Debt to buy more Bitcoin. And tell the world about it loudly. But let's be real — MicroStrategy's Bitcoin playbook won't pump stock prices forever, at least not for other public companies. The arbitrage opportunity is closing rapidly as more firms adopt similar strategies.MicroStrategy enjoys first mover advantage and guru status with Michael Saylor. New corporate BTC buyers lack that credibility and cult following with Bitcoiners. The impact diminishes with each new adopter.Bitcoin's growth is slowing, too. Doing a 5x annually gets harder as the marginalized rising competition for a somewhat fixed BTC supply spells diminishing relative returns.Let's also remember — today's investors can get Bitcoin exposure easier than when MicroStrategy started. ETFs and funds reduce the impact of new companies holding BTC directly.All this means the MicroStrategy playbook is closing fast for public companies. Firms considering it must act quickly to maximize gains before the strategy gets overplayed.To be clear, I'm incredibly bullish on corporations adopting BTC treasury reserves. It's just that early movers will benefit the most. The impact will wane over time for new adopters.And of course, regardless of time, companies will continue to benefit from adopting this strategy as the Bitcoin price continues to increase forever.

Full write-up on @FoxBusiness coming shortly.— Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) November 14, 2024  The overton window has finally shifted this past week and now everyone is seemingly scrambling to adopt BTC as a reserve asset.

I suspect more states in the US, specifically the more conservative states, will follow Pennsylvania’s lead in the future in introducing the same or similar legislation. The benefits of adopting bitcoin have become impossible to ignore.Remember, 94.20% of the total 21 million bitcoin supply has already been issued. It is estimated that around 3-5 million of those coins has been lost foreverUS spot Bitcoin ETF hold 1.07 million BTCMicroStrategy holds 279,420 BTCThe US holds 208,109 BTC Various other countries are in possession of large amounts of BTCTons of public and private companies are large amounts of BTC? amounts of BTC owned by everyday people around the world  BTC Treasuries  Many years ago I came to the conclusion that this level of bitcoin adoption was inevitable, but with all this momentum from large public institutions, I think we’re going to hit $100,000 bitcoin much sooner than I expected. The supply of available bitcoin is shrinking each and every day, and coupled with rising demand, the price is up 130% in the last year. This is a runaway train, folks.States, nations, and corporations are not going to stop accumulating BTC once they start buying either, so I am eagerly continuing accumulating as much bitcoin as I can before we hit that magic $100k number.

This increase of over 58% since the start of October and 29% since the beginning of November shows a significant influx of capital and increased trader participation, with much of this growth accelerating after the US election. Graph showing Bitcoin futures open interest from Oct. 1 to Nov. 15, 2024 (Source: CoinGlass) Futures also saw a dramatic increase in trading volume, with daily volume peaking at just over $207 billion on Nov. 13, marking the fourth-largest trading volume ever recorded. The surge in open interest and volume shows a significant increase in speculation and leveraged trading, an inevitable side-effect of a bull rally. Graph showing Bitcoin futures trading volume from Oct. 1 to Nov. 15, 2024 (Source: CoinGlass) While Bitcoin’s derivatives are growing steadily, with both old and new exchanges becoming prominent players in the space, half of the market is still dominated by two platforms — CME and Binance. This is why the changes in their market share and growth trajectories often reveal nuances in market sentiment that aren’t that obvious when looking at the big picture. In the past 40 days, Binance accounted for a substantial portion of the total futures market, with its open interest increasing steadily from $7.47 billion on Oct.1 to a record $10.61 billion on Nov.15. Graph showing Bitcoin futures open interest on Binance from Oct. 1 to Nov. 15, 2024 (Source: CoinGlass) Meanwhile, CME exhibited even more aggressive growth, with its open interest rising from $9.93 billion to a peak of $17.94 billion within the same period. Graph showing Bitcoin futures open interest on CME from Oct. 1 to Nov. 15, 2024 (Source: CoinGlass) The difference between CME and Binance’s market share shows what the market prefers. Binance, catering to retail and speculative traders, benefits from its global accessibility, lower fees, and broader altcoin derivative offerings.  In contrast, CME attracts a more risk-averse, regulation-focused cohort, with institutional investors favoring the exchange’s credibility. The rise in CME’s open interest to nearly a third of the total market by Nov. 14 points to institutional capital fueling much of the rally. This institutional participation is a strong bullish signal, as it suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s medium- to long-term prospects rather than the speculative fervor often associated with retail. The impact of the US election is evident in the data. Following Trump’s win on Nov. 5, Bitcoin’s price soared from $67,830 to a high of $93,500 by Nov. 12. Futures mirrored this enthusiasm as the $10 billion increase in open interest from Nov. 7 to Nov. 14 is a result of a surge in leveraged positions as traders rushed to capitalize on the bullish sentiment. However, the drop in trading volume from $207.04 billion on Nov. 13 to $133.02 billion on Nov. 15 suggests some profit-taking and reduced momentum toward the end of this period, potentially hinting at traders consolidating gains. Several additional observations can be made from this data. First, the sustained growth in Binance’s open interest indicates robust retail participation despite increased institutional presence in the market. Second, the correlation between Bitcoin’s price rise and the dramatic increase in futures volume suggests that the spot market’s bullish momentum was amplified by speculative derivatives trading. Lastly, the market’s preference for CME reflects growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, a crucial factor for long-term adoption.

These firms, each with a market capitalization under $50 million, are making bold moves as Bitcoin continues to attract interest from both retail and institutional investors following its recent surge to an all-time high of more than $93,000. Industry leader MicroStrategy has already set the standard for creating a Bitcoin reserve strategy, reinforcing the flagship crypto’s position as a valuable tool for businesses seeking long-term stability and growth. Thumzup Media bets on Bitcoin On Nov. 15, Thumzup Media revealed its board had approved a Bitcoin purchase of up to $1 million. At Bitcoin’s current price of $90,085, this would amount to approximately 11.1 BTC. Thumzup CEO Robert Steele emphasized that the decision aligns with the increasing demand for Bitcoin. He described the asset as a reliable addition to the company’s treasury, citing its finite supply and resistance to inflation as crucial advantages. According to Google Finance data, the announcement boosted Thumzup’s stock by 4%, with its share price reaching $3.97, with a total market cap of $36 million. Thumzup Media operates a social media marketing platform that connects users with brands. The platform allows individuals to earn money by posting authentic testimonials for advertisers. Solidion dedicates excess cash to BTC Solidion Technology, a US-based battery tech firm, announced plans to allocate 60% of its excess cash reserves to Bitcoin. The company also intends to convert interest earned from money market accounts into Bitcoin and earmark a portion of future fundraising for long-term Bitcoin holdings. Solidion highlighted Bitcoin’s potential to protect against inflation and diversify its treasury as a core motivation behind the move. The firm believes this approach will maximize shareholder value while taking advantage of Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. Solidion Technology CFO Vlad Prantsevich said: “We anticipate Bitcoin’s next evolution will be widespread adoption as a reserve asset by both sovereign nations and corporations, creating substantial value and long-term upside potential for Bitcoin as it gains further global acceptance. We’ve made our first purchase and are excited to continue stacking Bitcoin in line with our policy parameters.” Genius Group’s reserve strategy On Nov. 12, AI company Genius Group outlined an ambitious Bitcoin-first initiative, committing $120 million of its reserves to the flagship crypto. The plan also involves leveraging Bitcoin to enhance its educational programs and global payment capabilities. Genius Group’s CEO Roger Hamilton highlighted the potential for blockchain and AI to shape a decentralized future, stating: “We believe a new type of future-focused, AI-driven, blockchain-based public listed companies can bridge the divide for investors between the current, centralized and regulated world of NYSE, NASDAQ and other stock markets with the future promise of decentralized, exponential economies.” He also expressed confidence in Genius Group’s ability to bridge the gap between traditional finance and emerging decentralized economies through education and innovation.

Can DOGE succeed as Bitcoin adoption surges? Read more!The postBitcoin Steady Above 90k? President Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency Effectappeared first onCryptonews."," Bitcoin (BTC) is holding near $91,500 after breaking above the symmetrical triangle. The breakout is bullish and backed by institutional interest and politics. With that in mind, President elect Donald Trump announced the creation of the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) and appointed Tesla CEO Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to head cost cutting efforts in federal spending. Musk and Ramaswamy are looking to save $2 trillion, 30% of the federal governments $6.7 trillion annual budget. But two thirds of that is mandatory spending, Social Security and Medicare, so only one third is discretionary. What Is the Department of Government Efficiency? Trump created DOGE to “cut excess regulations, cut wasteful spending and restructure federal agencies”. It’s not an actual government department but Musk and Ramaswamy will advise on areas to improve. Musk’s influence goes beyond just cost cutting rhetoric; his tweet about the initiative mentioned he wants to reduce federal agencies from 400+ to 99. That’s in line with Trump’s broader goal of making the US a leader in crypto and government efficiency. Can DOGE Succeed in Cutting Federal Spending?

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies stand to gain from Trump’s pro-crypto stance and institutional moves like DOGE. As governments explore blockchain adoption for efficiency, Bitcoin’s growing adoption could receive another boost. Bitcoin Breaks Triangle Pattern, Eyes $93,450 Amid $91,850 Resistance Test Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $91,383, attempting to sustain its bullish breakout above a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart. This breakout signals the potential for further upward momentum.  However, a triple-top resistance pattern near $91,850 remains a major hurdle. A close above this level could drive BTC towards $93,450, $95,150, and even $96,550.   #Bitcoin breaks out of a symmetrical triangle, testing major resistance at $91,850!

Learn more inside.The postStrong ‘Buy Signals’ Emerge as Pennsylvania Moves to Hold Bitcoin Price– Will China Follow?appeared first onCryptonews."," Bitcoin price recently broke above a descending trendline at the $90,000 mark, signaling renewed bullish momentum. Currently trading around $91,300, BTC’s breakout hints at further upside as it nears resistance at $91,850. This upward movement is supported by growing institutional interest, notably with Pennsylvania’s proposed bill to hold Bitcoin as part of its reserves, showcasing a significant shift in state-level financial strategy. The rally is further fueled by institutional backing, as major players like Goldman Sachs continue to invest heavily in Bitcoin ETFs, with holdings now totaling $718 million. Combined with political support and increasing adoption, these developments are strengthening market confidence and setting the stage for potential long-term growth in Bitcoin price. Pennsylvania’s Bitcoin Reserve Bill Spurs Confidence in Long-Term BTC Growth As Donald Trump’s second term approaches, states like Pennsylvania are considering adding Bitcoin to their financial strategies. Pennsylvania’s proposed Bitcoin Reserve Bill would allow the state to hold up to 10% of its $7 billion reserves in Bitcoin, aligning with Trump’s vision of making the U.S. a “crypto capital.” This move has sparked optimism within the crypto community.  Pennsylvania Moves to Create #Bitcoin Reserve with Up to 10% of $7 Billion in State Funds. #BTC https://t.co/SuJqS9QFZC— TheCryptoBasic (@thecryptobasic) November 15, 2024  Following Trump’s election, Bitcoin surged over 35% in a week, reaching a high of $93,400 and temporarily ranking as the seventh most valuable asset globally. Although Bitcoin has since stabilized, it remains highly valued. The Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act, supported by Rep. Mike Cabell, aims to diversify state assets and shield against inflation. Backed by the Satoshi Action Fund, this legislation could make Pennsylvania the first U.S. state to hold Bitcoin, potentially encouraging others to follow suit.  Pennsylvania could allocate 10% of reserves to Bitcoin. Bill supported by the Satoshi Action Fund. Potential model for other states.  Goldman Sachs Increases BTC ETF Holdings, Boosting Bitcoin Price Goldman Sachs has intensified its interest in Bitcoin, investing around $718 million in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Grayscale (GBTC). This move has made Goldman Sachs one of the largest Bitcoin ETF holders, with 12.7 million IBIT shares valued at $461 million, up 83% since August. This surge in institutional investment has driven Bitcoin price to approximately $90,231, an 18.75% rise in a week. With market excitement mounting, Bitcoin’s share of the crypto market now approaches 60%, with $85 billion in daily trading volume.  Goldman Sachs’ investment in Ethereum ETFs further underscores traditional finance’s deepening involvement in digital assets, signaling confidence in Bitcoin’s potential to reach $100,000.  Goldman Sachs invests $718M in Bitcoin ETFs. BTC price rises 18.75% to around $90,231. Institutional interest boosts confidence in Bitcoin’s growth.  Bitcoin Price Breaks $90K Trendline, Eyes $93,500 as Bullish Momentum Builds Bitcoin (BTC) broke above a descending trendline around the $90,000 mark, signaling potential upside momentum. Currently trading at approximately $91,300, this breakout suggests bullish sentiment as BTC approaches key resistance at $91,850.  A close above this level could push prices higher toward $93,500, with an extended target at $95,100. On the downside, immediate support is observed at $88,400, followed by stronger support levels at $87,700 and $86,700 if selling pressure resumes.  Technical indicators support the bullish outlook.

His comments come the same week the Satoshi Nakamoto-created token surpassed its record high by soaring over $93,000.The postMichael Saylor Predicts Bitcoin Will Top $100,000 Before 2025appeared first onCryptonews."," Michael Saylor is planning a New Year’s Eve party to celebrate Bitcoin. He predicts the token will reach $100,000 thanks to its recent surge in price. Ex MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor Talks Bitcoin Surge “I’m planning the $100,000 party,” Saylor told CNBC. “I’m thinking it’s probably going to be New Year’s Eve at my house, so I would be surprised if we didn’t go through $100,000 in November or December.”  Bitcoin is Manifest Destiny for the United States.

The MIT grad, who notably increased MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings beginning in 2020, has been hailed for his prescience regarding the Satoshi Nakamoto-created cryptocurrency. Most recently, the company outperformed the S&P 500 index, with its current Bitcoin holdings valued at nearly $25 billion. Donald Trump’s Effect On Bitcoin The token has largely seen ballooning value since Trump defeated Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the U.S. 2024 presidential election earlier this month. On Wednesday, Bitcoin broke its record high by surging over $93,000, though it had since descended to $89,000 as of Friday afternoon. Trump, who recently launched his family’s crypto platform World Liberty Financial, widely praised Bitcoin and other digital currencies on the campaign trail while vowing to enact a crypto-friendly regulatory framework upon returning to the Oval Office. “We will have regulations,” Trump stated at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference, adding, “but from now on, the rules will be written by the people who love your industry, not hate your industry.” The one-time reality television star shared that he was “not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies” thanks to their value being “highly volatile and based on thin air.” “Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity….,” he said in the 2019 X post. However, his stance has since significantly changed.  I would like to wish our great Bitcoiners a Happy 16th Anniversary of Satoshi’s White Paper. We will end Kamala’s war on crypto, & Bitcoin will be MADE IN THE USA! VOTE TRUMP! #Bitcoin #FreeRossDayOne— Donald J.

The models, which include KEYMINER A1, KEYMINER X, and KEYMINER PRO, use advanced 3nm ASIC technology to offer high hash rates with reduced power consumption, the firm said in a recent announcement. The company also claimed that the miners have ultra-low noise levels, which allows them to be used in any environment.

Per the announcement, the entry-level KEYMINER A1 delivers a hash rate of 1100 TH/s for Bitcoin with a power consumption of just 650 W. It reportedly generates monthly profits of $1,200 for Bitcoin, $2,900 for Litecoin, and $3,800 for Dash, at current rates. KEYMINER PRO offers the highest hash rates—5800 TH/s for Bitcoin, 2800 GH/s for Litecoin, and 160 TH/s for Dash—delivering expected monthly profits of $6,300, $16,300, and $19,500 for each coin, respectively.

The recent election of President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for cryptocurrency, has further bolstered investor confidence. As reported, Jack Dorsey’s Block has also announced plans to ramp up investments in its Bitcoin mining initiative and self-custody Bitcoin wallet. Last week, the company said it would reallocate resources from its canceled “Web5” project, TBD, and cut investments in the music-streaming service, Tidal, to support this move. “We are scaling back our investment in TIDAL and winding down TBD. This gives us room to invest in our bitcoin mining initiative, which has strong product market fit and a healthy pipeline of demand, and Bitkey, our self-custody wallet for bitcoin,” the company said.

Bitcoin Magazine,US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve FOMO Is Being Horribly Oversold,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/us-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-fomo-oversold,"Would it be great if the U.S. started buying Bitcoin? Surely. The industry has political capital to cash in, but let’s use it wisely.","Let’s get one thing out of the way – The United States already holds more bitcoin than any government in the world.  Follow Rizzo on X.https://x.com/pete_rizzo_/  While this data is true, you wouldn’t exactly know this from the obscene amounts of FOMO being generated by industry lobbyists on social media.On X, BTC Inc CEO David Bailey, has been pushing for an Executive Order by President Donald Trump that would put this in place on day one, while Satoshi Action Fund founder Dennis Porter has been stoking state-level enthusiasm, pledging to get states active in purchasing before the federal government as some act of patriotic frontrunning. Look, I’m into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Yes, the United States needs a long-term plan for the dollar, one that finds it (in all likelihood) giving up its status as a global reserve currency. Yes, the U.S. should be actively boosting the Bitcoin market and industry. But, this sky-is-falling approach just couldn’t be more at odds with all reason.There are no other governments buying Bitcoin, nor with any (public) plans to. The next largest state holder of Bitcoin is apparently China, which has formally banned its use.Of the countries that are actively buying Bitcoin with intent – Bhutan has just over 10,000 BTC, while El Salvador is stuck around 6,000 BTC. Neither are going to purchase more Bitcoin than the U.S. government already has – nor does either have a widely popular money printer. Full stop – even if the U.S. government didn’t buy Bitcoin for a decade, its stockpile would be sizable. Sure, you may argue that it’s about sending a message, about showing leadership in the world, but there are many ways this can be done without blowing political capital.Is a Strategic Reserve more important than regulation that will actually ease barriers to our industry? That will empower businesses to actually grow the sovereign use of the currency?Let’s not forget the horrible taxation laws that make bitcoin holders think twice before using bitcoin for purchases.. All this is to say, Strategic Bitcoin Reserve advocates shouldn’t overplay their hand – a lot can be gained just by getting the U.S. government to stop selling the Bitcoin it already has, and there are arguably bigger gains to be had, or at least much worse laws to erase.Would it be great if the U.S. government started buying Bitcoin? Surely. The industry has political capital to cash in, but let’s use it to spread Bitcoin adoption, not just pump our bags.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Stablecoins Are Not Your Friends,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/stablecoins-are-not-your-friends,"Stablecoins are one of the biggest mistakes ever made in the Bitcoin space. They should be ostracized and discouraged, not embraced.","      Stablecoins are often pitched as a stopgap method, or a friendly tool for people in the developing world who cannot handle the volatility of Bitcoin. They are framed as something complementary to Bitcoin, not in competition with it. Nothing could be further from the truth. Bitcoiners have commonly used the meme of a trojan horse to justify many things over the years, rationalizing many shortcomings and compromises made over time as what is necessary to sneak Bitcoin into the legacy system to ultimately take over and win. That is exactly what stablecoins are, except in the reverse direction. Stablecoins are the trojan horse into Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s volatility makes using it challenging if you do not have the net worth to weather it, but there are mechanisms to handle this. Centralized schemes like Stablesats by Blink have been built to use bitcoin collateral to lock in a dollar value without needing to actually hold dollars. Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) offer another mechanism for accomplishing the same thing in a decentralized fashion. Instead we are propping up the US Dollar. Stablecoins are a solution to volatility, but they are a non-Bitcoin native one. They are the US Treasury’s trojan horse into the Bitcoin space. They do more to control and prop up the dollar than they do to “help” Bitcoiners handle the issue of volatility, which can be done while only holding bitcoin. Stablecoins give the Treasury a new lifeline to sell treasury bonds. Foreign countries have lowered demand and sold existing treasuries for some years now, and stablecoin issuers have stepped up to pick up the slack. The bigger demand grows for stablecoins, the more of a drop in foreign government demand for treasury bonds the US Government can handle. At a time where BRICS is planning more and more to shift away from their dependence on the US dollar, stablecoins represent a vehicle to ameliorate this issue. They also, unlike Bitcoin native solutions such as DLCs, present a security risk to holders. To my knowledge, aside from the Liquid Network, every network stablecoins are issued on come with a seize and freeze functionality built into the smart contract the issuer uses to create them. Almost all stablecoins support the arbitrary freezing and seizure of users balances on the different networks they circulate on. Surveillance is another aspect of stablecoin proliferation. The more that dollar stablecoins are adopted around the world, without needing to politically convince any government to officially dollarize I might add, the more the US Government’s ability to directly surveil foreign financial activity expands. Chainalysis and other companies become a de facto government surveillance system for foreign financial activity, with no need to subpoena or gather records first. It’s all right there on the blockchain. All the while, it propagates the idea that “blockchain” is a useful technology disconnected from Bitcoin, pushing the idea to your average person that bitcoin is simply an asset like gold to invest in. It creates a psychological narrative of “invest in Bitcoin, use your surveillance money when you need to spend.”Overall stablecoins are going to be one of the most epic unforced errors that have occurred in this entire ecosystem. People need to wake up before it becomes embedded so deeply into their lives, and the financial world in general, that it becomes difficult to disentangle ourselves from. People should be spreading and building on Bitcoin, a money built to enable freedom and sovereignty, not these cheap imitations called stablecoins that are nothing more than an extension of the surveillance and tyranny of the legacy financial system. This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Treasury Adoption Surges: Meet the New MicroStrategys,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-treasury-adoption-surges-meet-the-new-microstrategies,Institutional bitcoin adoption is here.,"     Follow Nikolaus On X Here  MicroStrategy’s corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy is taking off. Public companies are FOMO’ing into bitcoin. It’s almost as if Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance is giving companies the green light to stack BTC.Yesterday alone, seven public companies announced that they have bought or plan to buy bitcoin for their treasury reserves, with one new company committing to purchasing $1 million in BTC today. Crazy, right? It has felt like a minimum of one to two new companies a day are adopting bitcoin as a reserve asset — not to mention all the companies getting bitcoin exposure via the ETFs.It’s surreal to witness the FOMO from companies adopting a corporate Bitcoin playbook in real time. I mean, Michael Saylor has been preaching this and leading by example for the last four and a half years, and now that we’re almost at $100,000 bitcoin, companies are FOMOing in en masse. Was it the dramatic increase in bitcoin’s price that catalyzed this surge in more and more companies adopting Bitcoin, the incoming Trump presidency, or are companies finally taking Saylor’s advice seriously after his strategy has proven to be successful? It’s hard to tell — it’s probably a mix of all three. Beyond the borders of the U.S., other companies are also adopting the MicroStrategy playbook — and reaping the benefits of it. Metaplanet, a publicly-traded Japanese company, went from a zombie company to ranked #29 out of 4,000 listed companies in Japan by trading value since adopting a corporate Bitcoin strategy. Unreal.Metaplanet ranked #29 out of 4,000 listed companies in Japan by trading value, surpassing much larger market peers such as Itochu and NTT https://t.co/mUgdytMRM6 pic.twitter.com/Xzf66g9o1r— Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) November 19, 2024  Over the course of the next year I’m expecting this corporate Bitcoin adoption to only increase as the price of bitcoin rises and Trump takes office. “Welcome to the Bitcoin Standard” — Michael Saylor."
Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Multisig Company Casa Makes Self-Sovereignty Easy,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-multisig-company-casa-makes-self-sovereignty-easy,Casa co-founder and CEO Nick Neuman believes that taking a customer-centric approach helps get more people to use multi-key bitcoin vaults.,"Company Name: CasaFounders: Nick Neuman, Jameson Lopp and othersDate Founded: Late 2017Location of Headquarters: RemoteWebsite: https://casa.io/Public or Private? PrivateBeing self-sovereign isn’t easy — especially if you aren’t technically-minded.The team at Casa gets this and this is why, for over six years, the company has been helping customers secure their bitcoin in multisig wallets (also referred to as multi-key vaults).The company was the first to offer an easy-to-use version of such a product that also came with customer support. It was Casa’s plan from the onset to be there for their customers, as this type of support was lacking in the broader crypto industry.“The service element was what was missing from a lot of solutions out there,” Casa co-founder and CEO Nick Neuman told Bitcoin Magazine.“People need help doing this stuff, especially for large amounts of money. It was always the plan to support customers, because it was impossible to get support from exchanges or hardware wallets,” he added.“So, we just took a very support-heavy and user experience focused approach to everything.”Casa’s approach has paid off, as the company has become a household name in the Bitcoin and crypto space, and has come a long way since Neuman first had the idea for a company like Casa seven years ago.How Casa StartedIt was toward the latter part of the 2017 bitcoin bull run when Neuman had grown tired of his previous work in finance and tech, and found himself down the proverbial Bitcoin (and crypto) rabbit hole. By February 2018, he had an idea for a company and entered himself into a hackathon to attempt to bring the idea to life.“I participated in the first ETHDenver hackathon,” said Neuman.“I went in with an idea that I called key split, which was basically taking a private key using Shamir secret sharing and creating a social recovery mechanism,” he added.“I recruited a couple of people at the hackathon to build it with me, and we ended up winning.”Neuman quit his job and set out to start a company around this technology he and his team had created. But word had gotten out about his victory at ETHDenver, and the previous CEO of Casa, who was the head of the company before it pivoted to offering multisig wallets, reached out to Neuman, asking him to come on board.It was after learning that Casa had just recruited Jameson Lopp, self-described “professional cypherpunk” and now Chief Security Officer at Casa, that Neuman decided to join the team.“I was like, ‘Well, Jameson's going to be an unfair advantage,’” recalled Neuman with a chuckle. “Instead of starting my own company, I'm going to join.”Soon after Neuman came on board, Casa retired its then flagship product, the Casa Node, and the company shifted its focus to user-friendly multi-key vaults, a much needed product at the time. Before Casa, multisig software was so complicated that even Neuman himself struggled to use it.“There was the Armory multisig wallet and the Glacier protocol,” recounted Neuman. “Glacier wasn't even software. It was like a giant GitHub repo that you had to follow in order to set up your cold storage. Armory was super janky, too. I remember trying to use it once, and I couldn't figure it out,” he added.“We were the first to create multisig that was usable.”How Casa WorksCasa offers users two main set ups. The first is a five-key vault, which includes three keys on three different hardware wallets, one on the user’s phone (which is backed up securely in the cloud) and one that Casa holds.This was Casa’s first multisig product, which it rolled out while the company primarily focused on serving customers with a high net worth in bitcoin. Casa learned an important lesson while serving these clients, which was that even if developers create easy-to-use software, people still want an expert there supporting them as they use it — especially if they’re securing a lot of value.“When you're dealing with millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, you really want to have an expert there who helps make sure that you don't make a mistake,” said Neuman.Casa’s other main product is for those who might not be sitting on bitcoin whale-type wealth, but who still hold enough bitcoin where a less-than-ideal security setup has the potential to keep them awake at night.This product is Casa’s three-key vault, which the company brought to market in early 2019. It includes a key on a hardware wallet, a key on the user’s phone (which can be swapped out for another key on a second hardware wallet if the user prefers) and a key that Casa holds.Casa began offering this setup because it “always wanted to be able to offer great security and usability to as many people as possible,” according to Neuman.New Casa Services And FeaturesIn the past year, Casa has further broadened the services it offers.Two weeks ago, it announced its Enterprise Plan, which enables companies to more easily secure their bitcoin treasuries.“We've had businesses using Casa for self-custody for years, but they were always using our retail plans and just making it work,” explained Neuman.“We changed that, though, because I think corporate treasuries holding bitcoin has been popularized by MicroStrategy. We actually see that as a growing trend that's worth taking advantage of, and we're hearing from more Bitcoin companies that are storing bitcoin on their balance sheet that they need help with security,” he added.This summer, Casa also began enabling users to replace hardware wallets used in their vaults with YubiKeys.“We see people struggle with hardware wallets all the time, and so we were thought ‘How can we make this simpler?’” said Neuman. “We pieced together a couple of new pieces of technology that have passkey and and YubiKey key capabilities and were able to build something that hadn't been done before.”And in March, Casa launched Casa Inheritance, a service that makes it easier for the loved ones of Casa users to access the bitcoin secured in the vaults in the event of a user’s death.“With Inheritance, we heard from our customers all the time ‘Okay, I feel good about my Casa setup, but I'm worried about what happens if I die,’” explained Neuman. “So, we built that feature to make it super easy for their family to recover the bitcoin in case the main account holder dies.”Normalizing MultisigDespite all of the work Casa has done in the last six years, some still have an emotional block when it comes to switching to a multisig setup. Whether it’s because this type of wallet format was more difficult to enable years ago or because it’s understandably anxiety-provoking to make changes to one’s bitcoin security, people seem to drag their feet when it comes to using a multisig setup — even if they really want to — according to Neuman.“They hear the word ‘multisig’ and they're like, ‘That's too hard,’” explained Neuman. “What they don't realize is that to get started with multisig with Casa, you can use your same hardware wallet, and it is literally the same amount of effort as using a hardware wallet, but you significantly improve your security by doing it.”Neuman thinks that more people will come around and that multisig will become more widely adopted, especially during a bull market.“It takes the price of bitcoin going up where people suddenly have more value to secure,” said Neuman. “And it takes people hearing from their friends ‘Yeah, I'm doing multisig and it's not as hard as it sounds.”For those that do get the urge to try Casa, the company is allowing people to try the service at no charge for a month.Neuman feels that as more users come on board, it will not only benefit them, but potentially the industry at large as well.“If we can make it out of this bull market without another massive blow up like FTX because we've helped more people self-custody in a way that they feel good about, that feels like a real win to me.”"

Bitcoin Magazine,"Buy Drugs, Get Bitcoin","Mon, 18 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/buy-drugs-get-bitcoin,"I just learned about NiHowdy, a company that lets you earn bitcoin for purchasing prescription drugs, and I’m intrigued.","     Follow Frank on X.  A co-worker recently told me about NiHowdy, a platform that helps you save on prescription medication while earning bitcoin rewards in the process.For context, I’m a fan of bitcoin rewards programs like Fold, which let you earn bitcoin for making everyday purchases (I can’t help but appreciate deals like this — I grew up with a coupon-clipping mom.) I also like that NiHowdy differentiates itself from other bitcoin rewards companies by offering a discount on a product.While I’ve yet to use NiHowdy, it seems fairly simple to do so. You simply sign up through the company’s website, where you’ll obtain either a discount card or a QR code that can be scanned at selected pharmacies. You can also use the website to compare prices and find the cheapest locations to purchase prescription medication (the company is also working on a mail-order service).When you pay for your prescription, you’ll earn 3% back in bitcoin, which automatically gets deposited into your Coinbase account. (While I’d prefer NiHowdy had partnered with a different exchange, as I don’t like how Coinbase partners with government agencies to surveil transactions, this isn’t a deal breaker for me.)NiHowdy sees itself as fighters of Big Pharma…At Nihowdy, we're not just a prescription savings platform.

Bitcoin Magazine,How To Paint a Sandwich: A Solo Presentation On Memes And Digital Culture By Nardo At Bitcoin MENA,"Mon, 18 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-to-paint-a-sandwich-a-solo-presentation-on-memes-and-digital-culture-by-nardo-at-bitcoin-mena,"$5 footlongs, memes, mushrooms, and Bitcoin","In anticipation of a solo exhibition by artist Nardo at Bitcoin Mena, in collaboration with AOTM Gallery, I sat down with him to explore the intersections of memes, mythologies, and digital culture. Nardo’s work navigates the intriguing space between the tangible form of traditional painting and the fleeting nature of meme culture—two seemingly contrasting mediums that are evolving in tandem with Bitcoin.   The title of your exhibition, Fresh Impact, and the centerpiece painting, Sandwich Artist, both reference Subway-related memes. Notably, Subway became the first fast-food chain to accept bitcoin in 2013—a moment documented by Andrew Torba, who famously used bitcoin to buy a $5 sub in Allentown, Pennsylvania (an ironic detail, given that Torba is now CEO of the social network Gab). This early mix of Bitcoin and meme culture sparked humorous reflections on “spending generational wealth” on footlongs and highlighted themes of currency value over time, as the dollar’s purchasing power wanes while bitcoin’s grows. How does this Subway meme resonate with you, and how does it shape your approach to painting in an increasingly digital age?I think there is something to be said about quick consumption in contemporary culture—whether it’s fast food footlong subs or internet memes. The attention span of human senses has diminished to bursts of repeated dopamine, where selecting your type of bread, meats, and toppings becomes the most exciting part of your afternoon. Then comes the tireless effort of finishing 12 inches of processed food matter. You repeat this over and over because it’s convenient, and maybe next time, you’ll excite yourself by swapping cheddar for provolone.However, Subway has developed a systematic experience that feels eternal. Memes and internet behavior function in a similar way. The ephemeral consumption of entertaining or humorous memes acts as the dopamine hit—we share them with friends, they spread at rapid speeds, and then they often die off, leading us to move on to the next. Yet, the success of memes also lies in their systems: cultural iconography, bold fonts superimposed onto captivating imagery, hyper-sharpened visuals, deep-fried aesthetics, or low effort applications. Memes rely on visual and cultural layers—bread, meat, and toppings.I think, as it relates to Bitcoin, we should really confront its experiential nature in the exact moment of exchange. To have purchased a footlong for $5 worth of Bitcoin in 2013, only to view it today in 2024 as ~$4,300, is both absurd and somewhat painful—but the experience is eternal. The very act of using digital internet money in exchange for physical, consumable goods feels almost alchemical.Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins coined the term ""memes"" to describe units of cultural transmission, likening their spread to gene replication. Memes also resemble viruses in how they propagate through social networks, blurring the lines between genes and viruses as both can integrate into DNA and influence evolution. You and I have joked that memes—and memecoins—are akin to the fast food of digital culture, serving as cybernetic junk food or street drugs. Do you consider memes to be a low art form? Is the buildup of studio trash made famous by painter Francis Bacon or the outlandish waste and detritus of Dash Snow's 2007 “hamster nest” installation somehow related? What are your thoughts on contemporary artists like Christine Wang, who replicates notable memes in her recent painting exhibition, ""Cryptofire Degen,"" at The Hole in New York? What happens when a digital meme becomes a physical painting? This all ties back to what I discussed earlier—I am interested in slowing down the process of consumption. To meticulously hand-paint a meme in oil and present it as such can be a little jarring. Similarly, considering trash as form or content, rather than something to be discarded, fascinates me.After the user has consumed their lunch and doom-scrolled through countless memes on Twitter, what remains as the detritus of all that? The whole experience can feel like nullifying brain rot—a diminishing of structure and existence within passive chaos. Perhaps, though, that is the liminal mindset necessary to birth the most viral ideas.My introduction to cybernetics came from Japanese animation series like Ghost in the Shell (1995-2014), which explore cyberpunk themes such as internet-connected minds, hackers, and cyber viruses, echoing Dawkins’ ideas about memes and cultural transmission. The series highlights concepts like “ghost-hacking” and “thought viruses,” which replicate across networks and influence societal behavior, aligning with Dawkins' notion of self-replicating cultural units. Given your recent exploration of the “skibidi toilet” meme phenomenon, what insights have you gained about how this meme has propagated across social networks and shaped the collective consciousness of younger audiences?The Ghost in the Shell connection isn’t far removed from the world as we know it now. Much like the premise of that “fiction,” our fleshy brains are nestled within a cybernetic façade of digital personas and communications. We practically live vicariously through a digitized shadow-self—a projection of what we think we could become. This aligns with why I often say, “You become what you meme.”I am deeply intrigued by the phenomenon of American youth becoming obsessed with new memes that older generations are unable to compute, such as Skibidi Toilet. I think it is in this fracturing of sensibility that new languages are born, while old mythologies are repackaged in contemporary ways. Skibidi Toilet is the Iliad of the Internet.Beyond Ghost in the Shell's exploration of cybernetics, the seminal anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion intersects with the Age of Aquarius concept through its themes of interconnectedness and collective consciousness. The series delves into the merging of individual identities, echoing how ""hive mind"" behaviors in contemporary internet culture reflect the rapid influence of shared information and memes. In your artwork Sandwich Artist, you highlight the tension between individual artistry and the pressures of representing a faceless brand. How have you observed this shift over time, and how can artists engage with collective ideas while preserving their individuality in today’s digital culture?The Sandwich Artist piece utilizes a well-known meme template, yet through various digital alterations—specifically the literal scribbling out of pre-existing text—it takes on the feel of graffiti and eventually becomes my own. I like this piece for how it represents an individual manifesto of my work and reflects how I think about my artistry as a whole. Sure, consistent branding and aesthetics are great for sales if done right, but I’m more interested in how my work exists within a long enough historical timeline. The hive mind desires a brand to rally behind, yet history yearns for individual artistry.We’ve discussed the term “subway” in relation to submarine sandwiches, but it also evokes the idea of underground transportation. Japan famously studied mycelial growth patterns to optimize its subway and train systems. Similar to fungi, memes propagate and connect individuals in a vast, decentralized network, evolving as they move from one “host” to another. This fungal comparision highlights how memes adapt and spread dynamically, mirroring natural systems of growth and communication. How do you think artists can consciously navigate this memetic landscape of propagation, host vessels, and network dynamics?The lifespan of most internet memes moves so rapidly that it’s difficult to grasp them before they vanish into a shallow grave. Among the few that manage to take hold of the collective consciousness, I find it fascinating to analyze how they connect to humanity’s past on a metaphysical level. Trends and symbols have remained consistent throughout human history; they simply resurface in different forms as time passes.Efficient memes rely on efficient systems for delivering information. As artists, we should remain conscious of history and metaphysical symbolism, as this awareness can help us uncover our own primordial self through the mirror of memes.    "
Bitcoin Magazine,Would Jesus Be Bitcoin's Biggest Fan? A Holy Take,"Mon, 18 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/would-jesus-be-bitcoins-biggest-fan-a-holy-take,Deciphering the Divine: Could Bitcoin be the Modern Miracle Money?,"     Follow Mark on X.  Did you know the Bible is practically a financial thriller? Yep, it's got more money talk than a Wall Street boardroom—over 2,300 verses on cold, hard cash. That’s right, the Good Book might as well have been the Good Ledger, with more mentions of money than heaven and hell put together. So, in the spirit of financial enlightenment and a dash of divine humor, let's ponder a celestial question: Would Jesus have been a Bitcoin enthusiast?In the cosmic comedy of finance, Bitcoin burst onto the scene like a rebellious angel, vowing to overthrow the old guard of dusty banks and sneezy central bankers. With its blockchain chariot and peer-to-peer prowess, Bitcoin promised a financial utopia: freedom from restrictive permissions, the tyranny of borders, and the inflationary antics of print-happy central banks. But as this digital David takes on the Goliath of traditional finance, one can't help but wonder: Would Jesus be sporting a ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" T-shirt?Jesus had a lot to say about wealth, and not all of it was about giving it all away. He was into fairness, helping the needy, and not letting your left hand know what your right hand's up to—basically, the first-century version of anonymous transactions. Enter Bitcoin. With its knack for bypassing the money changers of today (looking at you, central banks), could Bitcoin be the modern answer to ancient prayers?But let's not convert all our loaves and fishes into Bitcoins just yet. Jesus also warned about the love of money being a root of all kinds of evil. And with Bitcoin's rollercoaster value, it's more bipolar than a Galilean storm. Would JC be cool with something that turns investors into overnight millionaires or leaves them crying into their keyboards? Divine verdict: probably not.Jesus was all about helping the little guy, and Bitcoin's decentralized gospel sings a similar tune. It's a financial lifeline for the unbanked masses, promising escape from the clutches of overbearing governments and hyperinflation hellfires. But here's the heavenly hiccup: Bitcoin's not exactly the Robin Hood of crypto. Its kingdom is a tad unequal, with a few digital disciples holding the lion's share of the coins.In the beginning, Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin. And it was good. Fast forward a few millennia (in internet years), and Bitcoin's disciples are spreading the good news far and wide. Like Jesus' OG crew, they're on a mission to liberate the financial faithful from the Romans—err, central banks—of our time. But instead of crosses, they bear the mark of the Bitcoin, preaching the blockchain gospel of hope and financial freedom.Despite being crucified by critics more times than we can count, Bitcoin keeps rising from the dead. Its resilience mirrors the biblical tales of underdogs and persecuted heroes, proving that sometimes, faith (and a good encryption algorithm) can move mountains—or at least market caps.Picture this: Jesus mulling over the Bitcoin craze. It's not just water into wine; it's transforming the financial system. Would He be a fan? You bet! Jesus, with His knack for shaking up the status quo, might just see Bitcoin as the loaves and fishes of the digital age—multiplying financial access for the masses and sticking it to those temple-money-changer types, a.k.a., the centralized banks of today.Imagine Jesus in today’s digital marketplace. He’d likely be intrigued by Bitcoin’s potential to empower the least among us. After all, here’s a technology that transcends borders, cuts out the financial middlemen, and offers a beacon of hope to those sidelined by traditional banking systems. Bitcoin’s blueprint for a more inclusive economy might just get a celestial thumbs up.But would He dive headfirst into the speculative whirlpool? Probably not. However, He might champion the underlying principles—freedom, equity, and the chance for everyone to participate in the global economy. Jesus, the carpenter, was all about building things up, not tearing them down. In that light, Bitcoin could be seen as a tool, not just for wealth creation, but for forging stronger communities through shared economic opportunity.As we tread the ethereal pathways of cryptography and conscience, let's ponder a Jesus-inspired approach: balancing our digital dollars with acts of kindness, generosity, and a commitment to uplifting others. The ledger of life isn't just about accruing Bitcoin; it's about the wealth of our actions and the currency of our character.So, while diversifying your earthly portfolio, remember the most precious investment of all: love and goodwill. After all, in the grand scheme of the universe, those are the assets that yield the highest return. And who knows? In the grand, interconnected network of humanity, we’re all part of a greater blockchain, each of us a link in a chain of acts of kindness, stretching out into eternity. Now that’s an investment strategy even Jesus might endorse.This article is a Take. Opinions expressed are entirely the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine."

The funds aim to generate income through options contracts linked to the firm’s Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded products (ETPs), including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), its mini Bitcoin trust, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETH), and its mini Ethereum trust. The Bitcoin filing stated: “Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets (including investment borrowings) in Bitcoin ETPs, options contracts that utilize a Bitcoin ETP as the reference asset, and other instruments that have economic characteristics and provide investment exposure similar to such investments.” The same language was employed in the Ethereum filing. Unlike traditional crypto funds, these ETFs will not directly hold Bitcoin or Ethereum. Instead, they will rely on exchange-traded instruments and derivatives designed to track digital asset prices. This structure may lead to performance differences compared to the actual prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The filings did not disclose the funds’ ticker symbols or fee structures. Covered call ETFs use a popular income-focused strategy. They generate revenue by selling call options on underlying assets, which provides steady income through premiums. This approach also offers some downside protection during market declines. However, it limits gains, as the underlying assets are sold at a preset price if options are exercised. These ETFs are particularly appealing to income-oriented investors seeking higher returns than traditional ETFs, though they may underperform in highly bullish markets. Grayscale crypto products Grayscale’s timing reflects its history of pushing boundaries in crypto ETFs. The firm played a pivotal role in the eventual launch of crypto-related spot crypto ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Since their launch, spot Bitcoin ETFs have achieved rapid growth, attracting significant inflows and becoming one of the fastest-growing segments in the US ETF market. Meanwhile, Grayscale is also working to transition its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC), which holds assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, into an ETF. Additionally, it has introduced several trusts for other digital assets, including XRP, Sui, MakerDAO, Avalanche, and Aave, showcasing its ongoing efforts to expand crypto investment opportunities.

Satoshi Act Fund CEO and co-founder Dennis Porter revealed the development, which has sparked renewed debates over Bitcoin’s role in national economic strategy. BlackRock, which manages more than $10 trillion in assets, has yet to release an official statement confirming the claim. However, the firm has previously highlighted Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation and a diversification tool for reserves. Porter told CryptoSlate: “It’s a no-brainer for BlackRock to push for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Bitcoin aligns incentives. Now that BlackRock is pro-Bitcoin, they will push for policy that supports the technology. When incentives align, we all win.” Wyoming senator Cynthia Lummis has already introduced legislation for a strategic reserve called “The Bitcoin Act” and previously stated that it would be implemented within the first 100 days of Donald Trump taking office. The bill has become the fourth most viewed US legislative document as of Nov. 19. Government advancing plans Porter also revealed that the Trump administration is considering an executive order to formalize the reserve, aligning with the president-elect’s broader pro-Bitcoin stance. Advocates argue that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, finite supply, and independence from traditional monetary systems make it an ideal complement to gold for safeguarding the U.S. economy against dollar devaluation. Additionally, Porter said that state governments are rushing to pass legislation establishing their own Strategic Bitcoin Reserves before President-elect Donald Trump signs an executive order on the matter. Porter believes that “the states will lead,” framing the push as a decentralized initiative in line with Bitcoin’s ethos. Critics and warnings While proponents see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a modernization of reserve assets, critics have raised significant concerns about its volatility, environmental impact, and security risks. Bitcoin’s price, which has historically been subject to extreme fluctuations, could lead to instability in national reserves if adopted on a large scale. Skeptics argue that relying on an asset with such unpredictable swings could expose the US economy to unnecessary risks. Security threats also loom large. Bitcoin, as a digital asset, is susceptible to hacking, cyberattacks, and theft. High-profile breaches in the crypto space have highlighted vulnerabilities in storage solutions, even for institutional-grade systems. Critics worry that a national Bitcoin reserve could become a prime target for bad actors, jeopardizing national economic security.

In a Nov. 19 post on X, Horsley stated: “We expect options on the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) to begin trading Wednesday.” According to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, this could signal the introduction of similar options features across other Bitcoin ETFs. The news came shortly after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) confirmed that options trading for BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) would begin today, Nov. 19. Options trading allows investors to buy or sell assets at a set price within a specific timeframe, offering flexibility for speculation and risk management. As such, the introduction of this feature is expected to increase investor options for managing Bitcoin exposure. Industry experts believe it will enhance market liquidity, attract new participants, and integrate Bitcoin into the broader financial system. Limitation still exists However, not all aspects of the new options trading environment are without concerns. Bitwise’s Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies, expressed reservations regarding the position limits imposed on Bitcoin ETFs. For instance, BlackRock’s IBIT is capped at 25,000 contracts, which Park argues is too low compared to the 400,000 options the ETF could support. He wrote: “IBIT should have qualified for 400,000 options. To put this into context, CME Bitcoin futures contracts have a 2,000-contract limit, which is equivalent to about 175,000 contracts for IBIT. Instead, we were given just 280 Bitcoin futures contracts.” Park explained that such restrictions could disrupt market conditions, forcing natural buyers and sellers to navigate complex volatility patterns. Nevertheless, the Bitwise executive pointed out that retail traders should not focus solely on larger ETFs like IBIT but also explore other issuers, which could present attractive opportunities. Meanwhile, Park acknowledged that the regulatory landscape has progressed significantly in 2024, with the CFTC deferring authority for ETF options to the SEC. He stated: “If the CFTC had been as politicized as the SEC, we might not have had a fair launch at all. Their willingness to cede authority for ETF options to the SEC, recognizing them as securities within the scope of the law, is commendable.” Strong ETF flows The development surrounding the Bitcoin ETF options trading comes as the financial instruments continue to attract strong investor interest 11 months after their launch. Data from crypto analysis platform SoSoValue shows net inflows of $254 million for spot Bitcoin ETFs on Nov. 18, rebounding after two days of $770 million in outflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust led the pack with $89.3 million daily inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $60 million. Bitwise BITB, VanEck’s HODL, and ARK 21Shares ARKB recorded $44 million in inflows. Additionally, GGrayscale’sGBTC and its mini fund posted around $60 million combined inflows. These developments underline the growing demand for Bitcoin-based investment vehicles as the market matures and offer new opportunities for retail and institutional investors.

Lowery announced his application via Twitter, expressing his intent to guide senior defense leaders on PoW’s implications for national security. He stated, “I can confirm that I have submitted an application to serve as a military advisor on the National Security Council and/or the White House Office of Science & Technology Policy.” He emphasized the importance of understanding PoW technology’s role in national defense and encouraged support for his position. He said, “My goal is to advise the Department of Defense on the national strategic significance of Proof-of-Work (PoW) technology and provide senior leaders with policy recommendations related to a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and the U.S. Hash Force.” Known for his “Softwar” thesis, Lowery advocates for recognizing Bitcoin’s PoW mechanism as a transformative tool for national defense and cybersecurity. He argues that PoW technology can serve as a non-kinetic defense system, projecting power in cyberspace by imposing physical costs on digital actions. This approach, he believes, can deter cyber threats and secure digital infrastructure by converting electrical energy into secure digital assets. Lowery’s thesis suggests that integrating Bitcoin into national defense strategies could revolutionize how the U.S. secures its cyberspace. He proposes that the global electric power grid could act as a “macrochip,” physically constraining malicious actors and safeguarding data. By developing a robust hashing industry—referred to as the U.S. Hash Force—the nation could enhance its cybersecurity and maintain a strategic advantage in the digital realm. His ideas have gained attention within military and political circles. In late 2023, Lowery wrote an open letter to the U.S. Defense Innovation Board, urging the Pentagon to investigate Bitcoin’s strategic importance. He posited that Bitcoin could function as an “offset strategy” for the 21st century, similar to traditional military assets that deter physical attacks. Members of former President Donald Trump’s campaign have reportedly engaged with Lowery for insights on incorporating Bitcoin into their policy frameworks. In another, now-deleted tweet that contained a link to a website called ‘Policies for the People,’ he called for public support to bolster his application. He highlighted that a key obstacle is the lack of understanding about the Department of Defense’s role in Bitcoin policy-making efforts. “If you want to see me as a military #Bitcoin advisor[…] you can submit a recommendation at this website  The main blocker right now is that most people don’t understand why the DoD should be involved in #Bitcoin policy making efforts. Your voice could change that.’ Lowery’s background combines military experience with academic research. A graduate of Baylor University with a degree in mechanical engineering, he also holds a Master of Science in Engineering and Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His decade-long military career includes roles advising high-ranking officials on technical matters related to defense systems. The submission of his application marks a significant step in his ongoing efforts to integrate proof-of-work technology into national defense strategies. By seeking a formal advisory role, Lowery aims to influence policy at the highest levels, advocating for the United States to recognize and leverage PoW technology as a critical component of national security. Lowery’s proposals present a novel intersection of Bitcoin and defense policy, potentially shaping how the nation addresses cybersecurity challenges in an increasingly digital world.

Marathon explained that the zero-interest senior notes would be sold privately to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933. The firm initially aimed to raise $700 million but increased the offering to $980 million in response to investor demand. The firm stated: “The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of MARA’s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of MARA’s common stock, at MARA’s election[…] MARA estimates that the net proceeds from the sale of the notes will be approximately $833 million (or approximately $980 million if the initial purchasers exercise in full their option to purchase additional notes)” The unsecured senior notes come with no regular interest and will mature on March 1, 2030, unless redeemed, converted, or repurchased earlier. A portion of the funds will go toward acquiring more Bitcoin for the company’s treasury. Additionally, Marathon plans to repurchase $212 million in convertible notes due in 2026. Pricing details Marathon stated that the conversion rate for these new notes is set at 38.5902 shares of MARA stock per $1,000 principal, equating to an initial conversion price of about $25.91 per share. This marks a 42.5% premium over MARA’s volume-weighted average stock price of $18.18. Marathon’s Chief Financial Officer Salman Khan noted that this represents the highest premium for a zero-coupon offering since 2021. Meanwhile, market observers suggested that the move reflects Marathon’s flexibility to mine or purchase Bitcoin directly, depending on cost efficiency. Marathon expects to net approximately $833 million from the offering, potentially increasing to $980 million if buyers fully exercise their options for additional notes. Beyond repurchasing the 2026 convertible notes, the remaining proceeds will fund Bitcoin acquisitions, corporate expansion, strategic investments, and debt repayment. According to Bitcoin Treasuries data, Marathon currently holds 27,562 BTC, valued at roughly $2.5 billion. This makes it the second-largest Bitcoin-holding public company behind only Michael Saylor‘s MicroStrategy, which holds more than 331,000 BTC, worth over $30 billion.

In a filing, the Tokyo-listed company revealed that it has acquired an additional 124.1 BTC at an average price of approximately 14.1 million yen ($91,266) per coin for a total of $11.3 million. The latest purchase increases the firm’s total holdings to 1,142.2 BTC, valued at $104.8 million. Metaplanet’s Stock Surge 1,300 YTD Metaplanet’s stock closed at 2,295 yen, with daily turnover reaching 21.9 billion yen ($141.7 million), according to data from Futu. The company’s stock has surged 1,334% year-to-date, outperforming market benchmarks such as the Nikkei 225 index, which gained 0.5% on the same day. Simon Gerovich, Metaplanet’s CEO, noted on X that the company ranked 29th among 4,000 Japanese firms by trading value, surpassing major players like Itochu and NTT.

From October 1 to November 19, Metaplanet reported a BTC yield of 186.9%. On Monday, the company announced the issuance of one-year ordinary bonds worth 1.75 billion yen ($11.3 million) to fund further Bitcoin purchases, with a redemption date set for November 2025. Wall Street institutions have also been increasing their stakes in MicroStrategy amidst rising interest in Bitcoin holdings. The ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, characterized by increasing inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions, have prompted corporate treasurers to explore the inclusion of Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Just recently, digital asset prime services platform Abra launched a service designed for corporates seeking to hold cryptocurrencies as reserve assets on their balance sheets. MicroStrategy’s Share Hit Record High MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares surged 13% on Monday, reaching a record closing high after the company revealed it had acquired $4.6 billion worth of Bitcoin. The firm also announced plans to raise an additional $1.75 billion through convertible notes to increase its cryptocurrency holdings. The company’s stock performance has been remarkable, with over a 500% surge in 2024, far outpacing major stocks like Microsoft, which gained just 11% this year. As of now, MicroStrategy holds 331,200 BTC, purchased at an average price of $88,627. The current value of its Bitcoin stash places the company in a strong position, boasting an estimated $13.7 billion in unrealized profits. To fund its Bitcoin acquisitions, MicroStrategy plans to issue senior convertible notes with a 0% interest rate, maturing in December 2029. These notes offer investors the option to convert debt into equity, a strategy the company has employed in previous fundraises, such as an $875 million issuance in September 2024 and another in June. Last week, Pennsylvania State Representative Mike Cabell also introduced a bill in the state’s House of Representatives that would allow up to 10 percent of the state’s funds to be comprised of Bitcoin. The legislation, titled the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill, would grant the state treasurer permission to invest a part of the state General Fund, the State Investment Fund, and the Rainy Day Fund in Bitcoin.

The metric is calculated as the ratio of the total Bitcoin reserves to the total stablecoin reserves, essentially showing the market’s buying power and selling pressure. A low ESR indicates that stablecoin reserves significantly outweigh Bitcoin reserves, suggesting an abundance of liquidity ready to flow into BTC. This disparity has historically correlated with bull markets and rallies, as stablecoins have always been preferred for purchasing BTC on exchanges. Conversely, a high ESR suggests that BTC dominates reserves relative to stablecoins, which usually means limited buying power on exchanges and a potential for significant sell pressure. While there are many different indicators of bull markets, ESR is particularly valuable as it captures the readiness of capital to move into Bitcoin. Unlike isolated price metrics, the ratio reflects underlying liquidity trends and mirrors investor sentiment. On Nov. 18, the ESR dropped to an all-time low following a declining trend that intensified in 2024. Since the beginning of the year, the ESR decreased by just over 95%, dropping from 0.0015276 on Jan.1 to an all-time low of 0.00007317 by Nov.18. During the same period, Bitcoin’s price skyrocketed from $44,200 to $90,500, showing a clear inverse relationship between the ratio and price. Graph showing the exchange stablecoin ratio from Feb. 23, 2022, to Nov. 18, 2024 (Source: CryptoQuant) The US presidential election on Nov. 5 had a profound impact on the market, acting as a catalyst for Bitcoin’s surge to its all-time high of $93,000. It triggered record trading volumes in both spot and derivatives markets as institutions and retail investors rushed to capitalize on Bitcoin’s growing narrative as a hedge and store of value. These heightened trading activities drove Bitcoin’s price higher while stablecoin reserves accumulated, further compressing the ESR. The all-time low in ESR paired with Bitcoin trading between $90,000 and $92,000 shows a market in a unique position. A low ESR during a period of price growth shows a robust demand fueled by substantial capital reserves in stablecoins. Such an environment limits the downside risk for Bitcoin, as the abundance of stablecoins creates a sort of liquidity cushion ready to absorb any selling pressure. At the same time, the limited BTC supply on exchanges exacerbates scarcity, pushing prices higher. Graph showing the total amount of BTC held on exchanges from Jan. 1 to Nov. 18 (Source: CryptoQuant) Looking at the changes over the year, the sharpest drop in the ESR occurred right after the US elections as Bitcoin entered its most aggressive rally this year. This suggests that the market was accumulating stablecoins during periods of price consolidation earlier in the year and deployed them to purchase BTC as soon as sentiment turned bullish. The interaction we’ve seen between stablecoin accumulation and rising prices shows that these reserves have a strategic nature — serving both as a buffer and a growth catalyst. Graph showing the exchange stablecoin ratio from Jan. 1 to Nov. 18 (Source: CryptoQuant) The implications of this drop in ESR in the coming weeks and months are significant. If levels continue to remain low or drop even further while Bitcoin’s price climbs higher, it will mean that the market is heavily capitalized with dry powder. Under such a scenario, we can expect further stable upward movement. However, we could also see a much more aggressive deployment of stablecoins into BTC. While this would benefit the market in the short term by driving the price higher, it could also leave exchanges with diminished stablecoin reserves — leading to higher volatility in the future.

The Layer-2 network aims to bridge the gap between Bitcoin and DeFi, offering enhanced interoperability and abstraction. Its goal is to bring Bitcoin-native DeFi to a broader audience, making it easier for users to interact with Bitcoin-based decentralized applications (dApps). The mainnet launch comes on the heels of significant institutional backing and a successful token sale. Bitfinity’s token is now listed on major exchanges like KuCoin, Huobi, and Gate.io, generating $5 million in over-the-counter (OTC) sales, primarily driven by community participation. Bitfinity also secured $7 million earlier this year in a funding round backed by top investors, including Polychain’s Beacon Fund, ParaFi, Draft Ventures, Warburg Series, and 9 Yards Capital. Meanwhile, Bitfinity said it is introducing Bitgems, a new feature that rewards users for social interactions. Participants can mine digital gems through a Token Generation Event (TGE) program, further engaging the community and expanding the ecosystem. Leveraging ICP technology Bitfinity integrates Internet Computer Protocol’s (ICP) Chain Fusion Technology to support Bitcoin-native assets within an EVM-compatible environment. This integration aims to enable the secure development of Bitcoin smart contracts, offering a more decentralized and user-controlled ecosystem. The network’s use of a threshold signature scheme creates a decentralized bridge to Ethereum, eliminating the need for centralized intermediaries and enhancing users’ security and control. Meanwhile, Bitfinity’s mainnet launch coincides with a surge in Bitcoin’s price and a resurgence of interest in its DeFi ecosystem. This increased activity has drawn more institutional attention, fueling excitement around Bitfinity’s potential to unlock new opportunities within the Bitcoin space. Lomesh Dutta, the VP of Growth at Dfinity, emphasized that Bitfinity’s EVM compatibility could redefine Bitcoin’s DeFi landscape. He stated: “The incredible community and investor support we’ve seen speaks to the impact of a platform designed to bring scalability, interoperability, and secure DeFi solutions to Bitcoin users.” The post Bitfinity bridges Bitcoin and Ethereum with new Layer-2 mainnet, raises $12 million appeared first on CryptoSlate.

BTC rose 3% over the past 24 hours. According to CryptoSlate data, Solana (SOL) closely followed Bitcoin’s performance, with a 2.7% price increase, reaching $244 at the time of publication. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) stood still with a 0.1% drawdown in the same period, priced at $3,128.78. Notably, ETH has accumulated a negative 5% performance over the past seven days, despite its spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) net flows becoming positive recently. Bitcoin correlations Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, highlighted that ETH reached a three-year low correlation with BTC, as the pair’s Pearson correlation coefficient reached 0.3 points. He added: “Just because BTC is strong doesn’t mean you should buy ETH. Each asset is now following its own path.” The Pearson Correlation Coefficient tracks the relation between two variables, ranging from -1 to 1. The closer the relation gets to 1 point, the more positively correlated the variables are. On the other hand, Dogecoin (DOGE) maintains its bullish momentum, rising 10.7% daily to $0.408, its highest price since early June 2021. According to DefiLlama, DOGE’s correlation with BTC has been 0.99 over the past month. Adding to the momentum The new price peak comes amid boosted optimism following the start of options trading on BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out that the ratio between calls and puts on IBIT’s options closed at 0.17. This ratio means much more interest in calls than puts, which is a bullish setup. He added: “For context, this ratio for $SPY is 1.1 and $TSLA is .59 while $TLT is .79.” In the first hours of trading, IBIT’s options registered over $446 million in volume, which Balchunas called “a ton” for an opening trading day.

While this figure seemed like a big target a few months ago, BTC surpassing $90,000 on November 13 demonstrates that the asset is on its way to $100k. A new ATH for BTC was also recorded on November 19, as the asset climbed to $94,000.  BITCOIN HITS $94,000 pic.twitter.com/CPSEbNwyBB— Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) November 19, 2024  Current Factors Driving Bitcoin To $100k  Daryll Netscher, Founder of Tren Finance, told Cryptonews that several interconnected factors are driving Bitcoin’s approach to the $100,000 milestone. “First, we’re seeing unprecedented institutional adoption amid significant political shifts. Following Donald Trump’s victory in the recent U.S. presidential election, market sentiment has strengthened due to expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment,” Netscher said. “The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has also created a more accessible on-ramp for traditional investors.”  Netscher believes the current institutional framework will provide a stronger foundation for Bitcoin’s growth than previous price rallies. He further pointed out that the broader macroeconomic environment shows favorable conditions for Bitcoin investment.  “The Bitcoin halving event in 2024, which historically precedes periods of price appreciation, is coinciding with increasing institutional interest, creating a unique combination of supply reduction and demand growth,” Netscher said. This is already being demonstrated, as the current BTC bull run has led to Bitcoin backers like MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Metaplanet announcing new BTC purchases this week. Notably, MicroStrategy now holds 1.5% of the asset’s total supply. Bitcoin Is Trending Up, Volatility Declines While the $100k BTC price will be an important milestone, Tim Enneking, Founder and Principal of Digital Capital Management, told Cryptonews that the price of Bitcoin is trending up regardless of current factors. “Bitcoin is increasing due to deflation, inflation in fiat currencies, fear of missing out, and the fact that there is no entity controlling the asset,” Enneking said. Enneking added that the growing dependency on the Internet is a reason for Bitcoin’s increasing price. He believes this is the case due to the ease of transferability associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. “In order for something to qualify as money, it must now be easily transferable. Crypto is ultimately transferable,” he said. “And while I believe that nothing in crypto space is close to being a currency, the idea of a transferable form of significant wealth is a big idea.” Enneking pointed out that it is fascinating to see what President-Elect Trump thinks of establishing a Bitcoin strategic reserve under his term. Enneking also noted that Bitcoin’s volatility has been declining. He believes this is due to a changing crypto investor profile that occurs every 18 months. “In the last 18 months, institutions came in and spotted Bitcoin ETFs were established,” he said. “Every 18 months, there is a new investor profile, which decreases Bitcoin’s volatility.” What $100k BTC Means For Institutional and Retail Adoption Bitcoin reaching $100,000 will impact both institutional and retail investors. However, Enneking pointed out that institutions will be much less prone. “For institutional investors, this is just another number, but the psychological impact of the $100k Bitcoin price will have a major effect on retail investors. Fear of missing out will also become even greater when Bitcoin hits $100k,” Enneking explained. Netscher added that this price milestone may trigger a transformative shift in how cryptocurrencies are integrated into the broader financial system. “On the institutional front, this achievement would validate the thesis of early institutional adopters while creating a new baseline for portfolio allocations,” he said. “We’re already seeing major financial institutions maintaining small cryptocurrency positions, but this level of market maturity would likely catalyze a more systematic approach to digital asset allocation.”  #Bitcoin 100k earlier than anyone expects.100k will be a floor price this cyclewith potential of truly enjoying one of the biggest parabolic run in recent cyclesSupply shock– Government reserves– ETFs– Institution Adoption as cash reserve– Widespread mainstream adoption…— Mr. H (@MisterHcrypto) November 19, 2024  Netscher believes that the resulting market capitalization would make Bitcoin too important for institutional investors to ignore. This could potentially lead to standardized cryptocurrency allocation models similar to those used for gold and other alternative assets. Echoing Enneking, Netscher added that the retail landscape would likely experience an even more dramatic transformation.  “This milestone would generate unprecedented media attention and public interest, but more importantly, it would validate the ‘digital gold’ narrative for a broader audience,” Netscher explained. “The heightened visibility would likely accelerate the development of user-friendly financial products and services, making cryptocurrency more accessible to average investors.” While this is already being demonstrated with the emergence of Bitcoin ETFs, Netscher expects to see Bitcoin-based products becoming standard offerings across traditional banking platforms. Bitcoin Likely To Reach $100k and Beyond While Bitcoin’s price continues to hover around the $93k mark, Netscher believes the current market structure suggests that the eventual $100k milestone could serve as a stepping stone rather than a ceiling. “The combination of institutional adoption through ETFs, professional market makers, and longer-term investment strategies provides a more sustainable foundation for price discovery than in previous cycles, indicating potential for continued momentum,” he said. Enneking predicts Bitcoin will surpass $100k and reach at least $120k by the end of next year. “Historically, there have always been 4-year cycle fits. After the BTC halving event, it’s always about a 6-month delay before the BTC bull market starts. This typically lasts about a year and is pretty stable,” he said. Netscher further explained that the confluence of the 2024 halving event’s supply impact, coupled with the maturing institutional infrastructure, creates uniquely favorable conditions for sustained Bitcoin growth.  However, he mentioned that while the path beyond the $100k Bitcoin level may be supported by stronger fundamentals, it will likely include periods of consolidation and corrections.  “But, these will be potentially less severe than in previous cycles due to the more sophisticated market participation we’re witnessing,” Netscher said.

Coinbase Delisting Of WBTC: What’s Behind the December 19 Deadline? WBTC, a token launched in 2019 to bring Bitcoin liquidity to DeFi, is backed 1:1 by Bitcoin and currently has a market cap of $13.6 billion.  For years, BitGo acted as the primary custodian of the Bitcoin backing WBTC, but recent shifts have altered the governance structure.   BitGo distributed custody to three entities in August, including BiT Global, a Hong Kong-based trust company. This change has drawn attention due to BiT Global’s partnership with TRON creator Justin Sun–a figure known for his controversial reputation and influence in the crypto space. While this partnership was positioned as a step to increase “geographical resilience,” it has sparked industry concerns.   MakerDAO responded by restricting the use of WBTC as collateral for minting DAI, citing governance risks. Similarly, Aave announced it would closely monitor the developments. Coinbase, meanwhile, has introduced its own wrapped Bitcoin token, cbBTC, to provide a trusted alternative. Launched in September 2024, cbBTC is an ERC-20 token fully backed by Bitcoin held in Coinbase custody. The token has quickly gained popularity, amassing a market cap of $1.3 billion with a circulating supply of over 15,000 tokens.   Analytics show that cbBTC is primarily active on Base (82%), followed by Ethereum (16%) and Solana, highlighting its growing role in the DeFi ecosystem.

Michael Saylor Predicts BTC Will Break $100k Reports of the Virgina-based company’s latest venture comes amid its recent economic success, outperforming the S&P 500 thanks in large part to its large percentage of investments in Bitcoin. Under Saylor’s direction, MicroStrategy began slowly accumulating Bitcoin back in 2020. On Monday, Saylor announced that MicroStrategy had purchased $4.6 billion worth of Bitcoin (equivalent to 51,780 tokens), bringing their total holdings to nearly $30 billion (331,200 tokens). According to data compiled by Bloomberg, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin stash now exceeds Nike Inc. and Johnson & Johnson’s total cash holdings. “I’m planning the $100,000 party,” Saylor told CNBC earlier this month. “I’m thinking it’s probably going to be New Year’s Eve at my house, so I would be surprised if we didn’t go through $100,000 in November or December.” The former MicroStrategy CEO further claimed that President-elect Donald Trump’s November 5 election is “incredibly auspicious” for Bitcoin and that he does not see “any near-term threats on the horizon” for the cryptocurrency. Trump, who most recently launched his family’s crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, openly campaigned for a digital asset-friendly regulatory framework on his way to reclaiming the Oval Office. “We will have regulations,” Trump stated at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference, adding, “but from now on, the rules will be written by the people who love your industry, not hate your industry.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to climb, hovering around $94,000 on Tuesday.

Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Boosts MicroStrategy (MSTR) to Higher Trading Volume Than Tesla and Nvidia,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-boosts-microstrategy-mstr-to-higher-trading-volume-than-tesla-and-nvidia,The bitcoin treasury effect is real.,"     Follow Nikolaus On X Here  Today, MicroStrategy (MSTR) surpassed a $100 billion market cap to become the 93rd largest publicly-traded company in the U.S.At the time of writing, MSTR has done more trading volume than both stock giants Tesla and Nvidia today, and has traditional stock traders like the Wall Street Bets community losing their minds.Wow $MSTR is the most traded stock in America today.. to best $TSLA and $NVDA is crazy. It's been years since a stock has traded more than one of those two (it may have actually been $GME to last do it). It's also about double $SPY! Wild times.. pic.twitter.com/bUr8nycMX3— Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 20, 2024   This is absolutely mindblowing considering MicroStrategy was a mere $1 billion company when it first bought bitcoin for its treasury about four and a half years ago.  MicroStrategy's market cap from when they first bought Bitcoin to now  The big question I’m asking myself is, how and when does this end? Assuming MSTR continues to pump until the peak of this bull market, it's anyone's guess on how high MSTR may go.But how hard will it crash in the bear market, considering it is essentially a leveraged trade on bitcoin? Dare I even suggest that this time may be different, and that the downside of the next bitcoin bear market won’t be as brutal as the 70%+ corrections we’re historically used to seeing?Even with the spot bitcoin ETFs, and the notion that the US may lead the charge of nation states buying up mass amounts of bitcoin, I’m still not convinced that we don’t eventually see a massive downturn in bitcoin’s price. And I’m mentally preparing for a normal bitcoin bear market to commence after this bull market finishes sometime in the next year or so.But back to MSTR — Michael Saylor has thus far proven that the Bitcoin for Corporations strategy works in stunning fashion. Public companies have been coming out of the woodwork this past week announcing that they’ve purchased bitcoin for their balance sheet or plan to do so, and it seems this trend will continue as the CEO of Rumble asked his X audience if he should add BTC to their balance sheet (almost 94% of his 42,522 voters voted “yes”).Lets put this in a poll format...Should Rumble add Bitcoin to its balance sheet?— Chris Pavlovski (@chrispavlovski) November 19, 2024   Michael Saylor even offered to help explain how and why Rumble should adopt a corporate BTC strategy.Institutional bitcoin adoption is here and it’s only going to grow for the foreseeable future. As companies figure out the logic behind adopting bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the number of publicly-traded companies that adopt this strategy is going to explode. Companies that add bitcoin to their balance sheet will rise above most other companies — even top big tech giants — in terms of trading volume, as MicroStrategy has, until all companies add bitcoin to their balance sheet. I try to put myself in the shoes of a trader, with knowledge on Bitcoin and think to myself, “Why on earth would I buy any company’s stock if they don’t have bitcoin on their balance sheet?” I wouldn’t — it would be way too boring.Putting BTC on the balance sheet helps create volatility, and therefore opportunity for stock traders, which is good for the traders, stock price, and company overall. If you are a publicly-traded company, it is a no brainer to adopt bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,JIPPI IS POKÉMON GO FOR BITCOIN ,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/jippi-is-pok%C3%A9mon-go-for-bitcoin-,Gamified Bitcoin education will serve as the catalyst for hyperbitcoinization in the coming years. Jippi hopes to spearhead the next wave of Bitcoin adoption by offering newcomers a fun and friendly entry point into the industry.,"Today’s modern Bitcoin exchanges have drastically improved access to Bitcoin ownership in 2024. Gone are the days of janky peer-to-peer (P2P) trade forums and questionably secure early exchanges like Mt Gox. Instead, a legion of Bitcoin on-ramps focused on superior security and user experience (UX) has made purchasing your first Bitcoin a breeze. Many of these services have even embarked on education-focused initiatives to encourage greater adoption during Bitcoin’s most recent bear market. In November 2023 Swan launched Welcome to Bitcoin, their free introductory 1 hour course about Bitcoin. In December 2023, Cash App released BREAD, a free, limited-edition magazine that uses design to tell stories and educate readers about Bitcoin in a relatable and accessible way. What these initiatives show is that Bitcoin adoption is approaching a turning point. These two major Bitcoin exchanges, along with the industry as a whole, are discovering that easy access to a smash buy button does not guarantee purchase. Numerous barriers to entry still exist for nocoiners, which provide significant constraints to understanding Bitcoin, and thus throttle Bitcoin’s growth and adoption. As we approach a steeper incline in Bitcoin’s bell curve, throwing novices into exchange apps without sufficient education and cultivation is no longer a strategy for success.   @Vivek4real_  What once was a far simpler task of energizing early adopters and cypherpunks around Bitcoin’s clear value proposition, is evolving into a more complex and convoluted process of orange-pilling the early majority of future Bitcoin holders. This, we hope, will then lead to widespread Bitcoin mass adoption as society en masse chooses to store its time and energy in the best money ever created. For this hyperbitcoinization to occur, more people need to understand the intricacies of Bitcoin. This is easier said than done because Bitcoin still has an education problem:An Economist Intelligence Unit study reported that 51% of people said a lack of knowledge is the main barrier to Bitcoin ownership.A YouGov survey found that 98% of novices don't understand basic Bitcoin concepts. A nationwide survey from the Yale Center discovered that 69% of young people find learning boring.This research outlines the struggle of onboarding and educating the next generation of Bitcoiners, most notably younger generations who have been shown to possess a limited attention span of 8 seconds. For inspiration to help solve this problem, we can look at one of the most popular mobile games of all time… Pokémon GO.  pokemongolive.com  Pokémon GO was and remains to be, a global phenomenon. This beloved app caught the attention of Gen-Z, millennials, and Gen-X alike, boasting record-breaking engagement stats:In 2016, the game peaked at 232 million active players.Pokémon GO has grossed over $6 billion in revenue.In 2024, 24% of 18–34-year-olds in the US are playing Pokémon GO, while 49% of 35–54 year-olds are playing.We at Jippi believe that the success of this award-winning game can illuminate the path forward for Bitcoin adoption. So we have set upon the electrifying task of building Tribe Clash–the world’s first Pokémon GO-inspired Bitcoin education game. The rules are simple, create or join a Tribe and battle for dominance over a city with your friends by catching a Bitcoin-themed Beast in every Territory. Each week Jippi will release a new Territory to be claimed. A Tribe member will explore that Territory with their phone, where they will discover a Bitcoin Beast to catch. If they successfully answer all Bitcoin quiz questions correctly the fastest, they will then catch that beast. The Tribe with the most Territories and Bitcoin Beasts at the end of the game will win $30k worth of Bitcoin to be dispersed equally to each Tribe member.   Our vision is for Jippi to become the largest, most popular platform for beginners to gather, educate, and accumulate Bitcoin. We see Jippi as the most accessible on-ramp into the industry, where we can educate a whole new generation of Bitcoiners from novices to experts by lowering the barrier to entry.You can support the development of Tribe Clash by contributing to our crowdfunding campaign on Timestamp. Timestamp enables investors of all backgrounds to support Bitcoin-only companies and make an impact. Our campaign is open to both the general public and accredited investors, so we would love for you to join us on this journey.This is a guest post by Oliver Porter.

As such, its relationship with major traditional indices like the S&P 500 (SPX) and the Nasdaq Composite (NDQ) becomes a significant indicator of investor sentiment and use case evolution. These indices represent vital pillars of the traditional financial system: SPX reflects broader market trends, while Nasdaq is a tech-heavy benchmark closely tied to growth sectors and innovation. By monitoring how Bitcoin interacts with these indices, we can see whether it behaves more as a risk-on asset, correlated to equities, or a hedge, decoupling during times of uncertainty. Changes in Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional assets reveal shifts in market perception. A strong positive correlation suggests Bitcoin is moving in lockstep with equities, possibly as a speculative asset tied to risk-on behavior. A weakening or negative correlation, however, indicates Bitcoin is being treated as a hedge—akin to gold—against macroeconomic uncertainty, inflation, or geopolitical risks. These shifts can provide valuable context for Bitcoin’s price movements. Over the past three months, Bitcoin outperformed both SPX and Nasdaq by a wide margin. Bitcoin gained 58.79%, while SPX rose a modest 5.10% and Nasdaq gained 6.10%. This divergence became particularly pronounced after the US presidential election, when BTC surged to an all-time high of over $93,000, leaving traditional indices far behind. Graph showing the 3-month correlation coefficient between Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase and the Nasdaq Composite Index (NDQ) (Source: TradingView) The correlation coefficients between Bitcoin and the indices fluctuated during this period, but both ended in weakly negative territory. Bitcoin’s correlation with SPX settled at approximately -0.17, while its correlation with Nasdaq hovered around -0.17 as well. Before the election, there were brief periods of positive correlation, likely driven by macroeconomic events affecting all markets. However, the post-election period marked a clear decoupling as Bitcoin’s hedge appeal and speculative fervor took center stage. Graph showing the 3-month correlation coefficient between Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase and the S&P 500 Index (Source: TradingView) The weakening correlation shows that Bitcoin is increasingly moving independently of traditional equities. While SPX and Nasdaq reacted to earnings, interest rate expectations, and geopolitical concerns, Bitcoin’s price was driven by narratives of institutional adoption, scarcity, and its role as an inflation hedge. The 1-month data paints a similar but more concentrated picture. Bitcoin rose 36.52% in just 30 days, compared to a 0.99% gain for SPX and a 1.72% gain for Nasdaq. The post-election rally was the main driver of Bitcoin’s outsized performance, as enthusiasm around its long-term potential overshadowed the relatively cautious movements in traditional markets. Graph showing the one-month correlation coefficient between Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase and the Nasdaq Composite Index (NDQ) (Source: TradingView) The correlation coefficient during this period shows an even sharper decoupling. Bitcoin’s correlation with SPX fell to -0.35, while its correlation with Nasdaq dropped to -0.17. This suggests that while traditional markets reflected mixed investor sentiment—balancing optimism about economic recovery with concerns over geopolitical risks—Bitcoin was seen as a more straightforward bet on future growth and a hedge against uncertainty. Graph showing the one-month correlation coefficient between Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase and the S&P 500 Index (Source: TradingView) Interestingly, the correlation with Nasdaq was less negative than with SPX. This could be due to overlapping investor bases between Bitcoin and the tech sector, both of which attract growth-oriented, risk-tolerant capital. However, the overall trend is clear: Bitcoin’s independence is growing, particularly during high-volatility events like the election.

The firm stated that the proceeds from this offering will fund additional Bitcoin acquisitions and other corporate needs. Offering details The convertible notes will be sold privately to institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933 and to select non-US investors following Regulation S. MicroStrategy has also given buyers a three-day option to purchase an extra $400 million in notes. These notes are unsecured senior obligations that mature on Dec. 1, 2029. They do not bear regular interest, and their principal will not accrete. According to the firm, the initial conversion rate for the notes is 1.4872 shares of MicroStrategy Class A stock per $1,000 of principal, equating to a conversion price of $672.40 per share. This rate reflects a 55% premium over the average price of $433.80 recorded on Nov. 19. Meanwhile, conversion terms may adjust based on certain events. MicroStrategy said it expects net proceeds from the offering to be $2.58 billion after accounting for expenses. However, if buyers fully exercise the additional purchase option, proceeds could reach $2.97 billion. Top 100 public companies The move coincides with MicroStrategy’s rise into the top 100 US publicly traded companies, where it now ranks 97th, according to CompaniesMarketCap data. This rise was influenced by the firm’s impressive stock performance, which increased by around 100% in the past month to a two-decade high of over $430. The performance has also favorably positioned the firm against the high-performing stocks of AI giants like Nvidia. As of press time, early market indications suggest that the trend has continued, with the firm’s pre-market trading rising by around 8%, according to Google Finance data. MicroStrategy remains the largest Bitcoin-holding public company, with over 330,000 BTC worth over $30 billion. This year alone, it has added nearly 150,000 BTC to its holdings, solidifying its position as a leader in corporate Bitcoin adoption.

MicroStrategy began investing in Bitcoin under Saylor’s direction in 2020 and saw its stock rise by over 15% Wednesday. The token has seen a boost in popularity since President-elect Donald Trump was elected earlier this month, ushering in a wave of bullish crypto sentiment. Just last week, Saylor told CNBC that Trump’s return to the Oval Office will prove to be “incredibly auspicious” for Bitcoin. The former MicroStrategy CEO claimed he does not predict “any near-term threats on the horizon” for the cryptocurrency. On Tuesday, reports emerged that Trump had chosen pro-Bitcoin Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick as his Commerce secretary. Simultaneously, The Financial Times reported that the Trump Media and Technology Group was looking to buy cryptocurrency marketplace Bakkt. Trump’s affection for crypto—combined with his promise of a digital asset-friendly regulatory framework—has seemingly generated a wave of excitement about the blockchain sector’s potential. “I’m planning the $100,000 party,” Saylor told CNBC of Bitcoin earlier this month. “I’m thinking it’s probably going to be New Year’s Eve at my house, so I would be surprised if we didn’t go through $100,000 in November or December.” The post MicroStrategy Increases Convertible Notes Sale To $2.6 Billion To Fund Bitcoin Stash appeared first on Cryptonews.

The exchange’s analysts remarked that last week, BTC broke past initial resistance levels and hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $93,318. Additionally, it recorded the latest ATH of $94,040 just hours before the writing of this article. Notably, the surges moved BTC’s market capitalization (counting all BTC mined by the time of the report) to $1.8 trillion for the first time ever, said the analysts.   And in the process,   “Bitcoin flipped silver by total market cap.” At the time of writing the report, BTC was ranked eighth in the list of the world’s largest traded assets, as seen in the image below. Source: Bitfinex Alpha Report However, at the time of writing this article, BTC moved to the seventh place, as per Infinite MarketCap. Bitcoin’s market cap currently stands at $1.851 trillion, compared to silver’s $1.762 trillion. That’s a significant difference in the ranking where every million matters. Gold is, unsurprisingly, still in first place, boasting a massive market cap of $17.686 trillion – far more than any other asset below it. That said, it’s evident that BTC keeps climbing the ranks.

BTCʼs increase to that previous ATH of $93,318 marked a 39.5% jump since the pre-election sell-off and price of $66,880. This was accomplished in just under nine days, making it “the largest 9-day price increase for BTC since January 2021,” the analysts found. However, the market capitalization is a massive player here. In January 2021, it stood at just $450 billion. Therefore, “it takes significantly more capital today to effect such a change in price.” Per the analysts, “this recent move probably represents the largest volume of capital flowing into Bitcoin over such a short time, [while] the current ascent of Bitcoin might be one of the largest inflows into any asset in history.”  Additionally, Bitfinex took a deeper look at the US-traded spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As of November 17, these ETFs held $84 billion in assets. This is some 66% of the total assets under management (AUM) of gold ETFs. Therefore,   “Given the current average daily inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, they are now on track to surpass the AUM of gold ETFs within the next two months.” This, the analysts added, is a substantial acceleration from original estimations. These argued that it would take four to five years for Bitcoin ETFs to flip gold ETFs. Additionally, it is notable that for one major firm, this has already happened. BlackRockʼs iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has outdone the AUM of the company’s iShares Gold ETF (IAU).

Crypto News,Grayscale to Launch Bitcoin ETF Options Following BlackRock’s Record Debut,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-to-launch-bitcoin-etf-options-following-blackrocks-record-debut/,Grayscale Investments is set to introduce options trading on its spot Bitcoin ETFs this Wednesday.The postGrayscale to Launch Bitcoin ETF Options Following BlackRock’s Record Debutappeared first onCryptonews.," Grayscale Investments is set to introduce options trading on its spot Bitcoin ETFs this Wednesday. The move comes amidst a surge in investor interest, as indicated by the record-breaking performance of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) on its first day of options trading. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded nearly $1.9 billion in notional exposure traded on its debut, including 354,000 contracts, with a striking 4.4:1 call-to-put ratio. Overheated Options Market Pushes Bitcoin Above $94,000 The overwhelming interest in call options played a major role in Bitcoin’s surge to an all-time high of $94,041 on Tuesday. In response, Grayscale plans to launch options trading for its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC). The firm aims to “further develop the ecosystem” surrounding its U.S.-listed Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs), according to a company statement.  Grayscale is thrilled that Options trading on both $GBTC and $BTC will begin tomorrow – further developing the ecosystem around our US-listed #Bitcoin ETPs. pic.twitter.com/i7kFpOiogq— Grayscale (@Grayscale) November 19, 2024  Grayscale’s swift action follows the Options Clearing Corporation’s (OCC) recent approval of Bitcoin ETF options. The company filed an updated prospectus for its Bitcoin Covered Call ETF on January 11. The fund is designed to generate income using a covered call strategy—writing and buying options contracts on Bitcoin ETPs while holding Bitcoin or GBTC as collateral. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart highlighted the rapidity of Grayscale’s response to the OCC’s clearance. “They’ve wasted no time,” Seyffart noted, adding that the updated prospectus underscores Grayscale’s commitment to meeting market demand. The launch of Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF options comes in the wake of the firm’s pivotal legal victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last year. In August, the U.S. Court of Appeals ordered the SEC to reconsider its denial of Grayscale’s application to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF. The ruling represented a breakthrough in the regulatory landscape, challenging nearly a decade of resistance to crypto ETF approvals. Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $800M in Inflows U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed a remarkable surge in inflows, with $816.44 million recorded on Nov. 19, marking a 220% increase compared to the previous day. ARK and 21Shares’ ARKB led the inflows, attracting $267.34 million—the fund’s highest single-day inflow since launch. Fidelity’s FBTC and BlackRock’s IBIT followed closely, bringing in $256.15 million and $216.12 million, respectively. Bitwise’s BITB, Grayscale’s GBTC, and VanEck’s HODL added to the momentum, with inflows of $52.75 million, $16.19 million, and $7.9 million. Total trading volume across these ETFs also soared to $4.78 billion, up from $3.62 billion the previous day. The contineud interest in Bitcoin ETFs comes as major Bitcoin holders like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet have expanded their Bitcoin holdings. On Monday, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy revealed it has acquired $4.6 billion worth of Bitcoin. The firm also announced plans to raise an additional $1.75 billion through convertible notes to increase its cryptocurrency holdings. Likewise, Metaplanet recently announced plans to raise $11.3 million through a third series of ordinary bonds to support its Bitcoin acquisition. The ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, characterized by increasing inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions, have prompted corporate treasurers to explore the inclusion of Bitcoin as a reserve asset.

(Well, there’s a weird sentence I never thought I’d write.)On Tuesday, the anti-crypto U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Chairman, Martin Gruenberg, announced he’d be stepping down in January.And yesterday, Heritage Falodun, CEO of DigiOats, Nigeria’s leading Bitcoin education and consultancy platform, educated members of the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) about the benefits of bitcoin and other digital assets.Falodun, an indefatigable Bitcoin proponent, spearheaded a seminar for the NDIC entitled “Cryptocurrency in the Evolving Financial Industry”.This week, @DigiOats alongside with #MassCyberTech completed a groundbreaking seminar for @NDICNigeria 🇳🇬on “Cryptocurrency in the Evolving Financial Industry”.

Proponents of Bitcoin should acknowledge our current political reality and make the case for Bitcoin to those in power if they want to see it flourish — or if they want to at least stop governments from crafting poor policy around Bitcoin and/or attacking the industry.Take a cue from Falodun and do your part to educate local government officials, members of state-level administrative agencies or even Federal-level bureaucrats about Bitcoin.It's one of the most important things you can do to keep your country from falling behind."
Bitcoin Magazine,The Bitcoin Pi Cycle Top Indicator: How to Accurately Time Market Cycle Peaks,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-bitcoin-pi-cycle-top-indicator-how-to-accurately-time-market-cycle-peaks,"The Bitcoin Pi Cycle Top Indicator has flawlessly identified every market cycle peak in Bitcoin's history. With its unique mathematical foundation and historical accuracy, could it predict the next top as Bitcoin evolves into a more mature market?","The Bitcoin Pi Cycle Top Indicator has gained legendary status in the Bitcoin community for its uncanny accuracy in identifying market cycle peaks. Historically, it has timed every single Bitcoin cycle high with remarkable precision—often within just three days. Could it work its magic again this cycle? Let’s dive deeper into how it works and its significance in navigating Bitcoin’s market cycles.  View the Pi Cycle Top Indicator Chart Here.  What is the Pi Cycle Top Indicator?The Pi Cycle Top Indicator is a tool designed to identify Bitcoin's market cycle tops. Created by Philip Swift, Managing Director of Bitcoin Magazine Pro in April 2019, this indicator uses a combination of two moving averages to forecast cycle highs:111-Day Moving Average (111DMA): Represents the shorter-term price trend.350-Day Moving Average x 2 (350DMA x 2): A multiple of the 350DMA, which captures longer-term trends.When the 111DMA rises sharply and crosses above the 350DMA x 2, it historically coincides with Bitcoin’s market cycle peak.The Mathematics Behind the NameInterestingly, the ratio of 350 to 111 equals approximately 3.153—remarkably close to Pi (3.142). This mathematical quirk gives the indicator its name and highlights the cyclical nature of Bitcoin’s price action over time.Why Has It Been So Accurate?The Pi Cycle Top Indicator has been effective in predicting the peaks of Bitcoin’s three most recent market cycles. Its ability to pinpoint the absolute tops reflects Bitcoin’s historically predictable cycles during its adoption growth phase. The indicator essentially captures the point where the market becomes overheated, as reflected by the steep rise of the 111DMA surpassing the 350DMA x 2.How Can Investors Use This Indicator?For investors, the Pi Cycle Top Indicator serves as a warning sign that the market may be approaching unsustainable levels. Historically, when the indicator flashes, it has been advantageous to sell Bitcoin near the top of the market cycle. This makes it a valuable tool for those seeking to maximize gains and minimize losses.However, as Bitcoin matures and integrates further into the global financial system—bolstered by developments like Bitcoin ETFs and institutional adoption—the effectiveness of this indicator may diminish. It remains most relevant during Bitcoin’s early adoption phase.A Glimpse Into the FutureThe big question now is: will the Pi Cycle Top Indicator remain accurate in this cycle? With Bitcoin entering a new era of adoption and market dynamics, its cyclical patterns may evolve. Yet, this tool has proven its worth repeatedly over Bitcoin's first 15 years, offering investors a reliable gauge of market tops.Final ThoughtsThe Pi Cycle Top Indicator is a testament to Bitcoin’s cyclical nature and the power of mathematical models in understanding its price behavior. While its past accuracy has been unparalleled, only time will tell if it can once again predict Bitcoin’s next market cycle peak. For now, it remains an indispensable tool for those navigating the thrilling highs and lows of Bitcoin.Explore the full chart and stay informed."
Bitcoin Magazine,How Viable Are BitVM Based Pegs?,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-viable-are-bitvm-based-pegs,A look at a recent report by Galaxy looking at the economic viability of two way pegs secured by BitVM.,"BitVM earlier this year came under fire due to the large liquidity requirements necessary in order for a rollup (or other system operator) to process withdrawals for the two way peg mechanisms being built using the BitVM design. Galaxy, an investor in Citrea, has performed an economic analysis looking at their assumptions regarding economic conditions necessary to make a BitVM based two way peg a sustainable operation.For those unfamiliar, pegging into a BitVM system requires the operators to take custody of user funds in an n-of-n multisig, creating a set of pre-signed transactions allowing the operator facilitating withdrawals to claim funds back after a challenge period. The user is then issued backed tokens on the rollup or other second layer system. Pegouts are slightly more complicated. The user must burn their funds on the second layer system, and then craft a Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) paying them funds back out on the mainchain, minus a fee to the operator processing withdrawals. They can keep crafting new PSBTs paying the operator higher fees until the operator accepts. At this point the operator will take their own liquidity and pay out the user’s withdrawal. The operator can then, after having processed withdrawals adding up to a deposited UTXO, initiate the withdrawal out of the BitVM system to make themselves whole. This includes a challenge-response period to protect against fraud, which Galaxy models as a 14 day window. During this time period anyone who can construct a fraud proof showing that the operator did not honestly honor the withdrawals of all users in that epoch can initiate the challenge. If the operator cannot produce a proof they correctly processed all withdrawals, then the connector input (a special transaction input that is required to use their pre-signed transactions) the operator uses to claim their funds back can be burned, locking them out of the ability to recuperate their funds. Now that we’ve gotten through a mechanism refresher, let's look at what Galaxy modeled: the economic viability of operating such a peg. There are a number of variables that must be considered when looking at whether this system can be operated profitably. Transaction fees, amount of liquidity available, but most importantly the opportunity cost of devoting capital to processing withdrawals from a BitVM peg. This last one is of critical importance in being able to source liquidity to manage the peg in the first place. If liquidity providers (LPs) can earn more money doing something else with their money, then they are essentially losing money by using their capital to operate a BitVM system. All of these factors have to be covered, profitably, by the aggregate of fees users will pay to peg out of the system for it to make sense to operate. I.e. to generate a profit. The two references for competing interest rates Galaxy looked at were Aave, a DeFi protocol operating on Ethereum, and OTC markets in Bitcoin. Aave at the time of their report earned lenders approximately 1% interest on WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin pegged into Ethereum) lent out. OTC lending on the other hand had rates as high as 7.6% compared to Aave. This shows a stark difference between the expected return on capital between DeFi users and institutional investors. Users of a BitVM system must generate revenue in excess of these interest rates in order to attract capital to the peg from these other systems. By Galaxy’s projections, as long as LPs are targeting a 10% Annual Percentage Yield (APY), that should cost individual users -0.38% in a peg out transaction. The only wildcard variable, so to say, is the transaction fees that the operator has to pay during high fee environments. The users funds are already reclaimed using the operators liquidity instantly after initiating the pegout, while the operator has to wait the two week challenge period in order to claim back the fronted liquidity.If fees were to spike in the meanwhile, this would eat into the operators profit margins when they eventually claim their funds back from the BitVM peg. However, in theory operators could simply wait until fees subside to initiate the challenge period and claim their funds back. Overall the viability of a BitVM peg comes down to being able to generate a high enough yield on liquidity used to process withdrawals to attract the needed capital. To attract more institutional capital, these yields must be higher in order to compete with OTC markets. The full Galaxy report can be read here. "
Bitcoin Magazine,"The Chart That Shows Bitcoin’s Bull Run Won’t Stop at $100,000 ","Thu, 21 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/chart-bitcoins-bull-run-wont-stop-100000,"Sure, there might be sell-offs, but we're far from peak Bitcoin.","Peak Bitcoin, hardly.   Follow Rizzo on X.https://x.com/pete_rizzo_/  As I wrote in Forbes in 2021, the world is waking up to a new reality in regards to Bitcoin – the unlikely truth that Bitcoin’s programming has cyclical effects on its economy. This has led to at least 4 distinct market cycles where Bitcoin has been branded a bubble, skeptics have rung their hands, and each time, Bitcoin recovers more or less 4 years later to set new all-time highs above its previously “sky-high” valuation. I personally watched Bitcoin go from $50 to $1,300 in 2013. Then, from $1,000 to $20,000 in 2017, and I watched it go from $20,000 to $70,000 in 2021. So, I’m just here to relate that, from my past experience, this market cycle is just heating up. For those who have been in Bitcoin, there’s one tried-and-true and that’s Google Search. As long as I’ve been in Bitcoin, this has been the best indicator of the strength of the market. Search is low, you’re probably in a bear market. Search heading back to all-time highs? This means new entrants are getting engaged, learning about Bitcoin, and becoming active buyers. Remember, this is a habit change. Bitcoin HODLers are slowing shifting their assets to a wholly new economy. So, Google Trends search then, represents a snapshot of Bitcoin’s immigration. It shows how many new sovereign citizens are moving their money here.   And it’s something that all who are worried about whether bitcoin’s price topping out in 2024 should pay attention to. Last year was the Bitcoin halving, and historically, the year following previous halvings has led to price appreciation. Maybe you’re tempted to think, “this time is different” – not me. I look at search and I see a chart that continues to accelerate into price discovery. Trust me when I say no one I know is selling bitcoin. As shown above, buyer interest is accelerating, and these new buyers have to buy that Bitcoin from somewhere. Add nation states, US states, and a coming Trump administration set to ease the burden on the industry? Well, I think the chart above says it all really. This article is a Take.

While presidential advisory councils are not new, a dedicated crypto council would be unprecedented, reflecting the sector’s rapid evolution since Bitcoin’s inception in 2008.  Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith emphasized the urgency of the council’s formation, stating it is “something Trump could do very quickly.” According to the report, the council will also advise on crypto policy and work with Congress on crypto legislation. It added that the council may be housed under the White House’s National Economic Council or operate independently.  According to industry insiders, major US-based companies, including Coinbase, Paradigm, and Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto arm, a16z, Ripple, Kraken, and Circle, are seeking a seat on the council. Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey, a key organizer behind Trump’s July appearance at a Nashville Bitcoin Conference, said: “It’s being fleshed out, but I anticipate the leading executives from America’s Bitcoin and crypto firms to be represented.” Excitement over Trump’s pro-crypto stance has already buoyed Bitcoin (BTC) prices, which touched a new all-time high of $99,100 on Nov. 21. Bitcoin reserve idea gains traction Satoshi Act Fund founder Dennis Porter is discussing introducing legislation in Texas on a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” The Texas movement is Porter’s latest effort to introduce a dedicated Bitcoin reserve to a US state. On Nov. 14, Pennsylvania, through Representative Mike Cabell, introduced a bill to create a BTC reserve using the state’s $7 billion fund. The proposal suggests an initial allocation of up to 10% in Bitcoin but also acknowledges that a smaller exposure of 1% to 5% could be a more suitable starting point. After Pennsylvania’s proposal, Porter stated that up to 10 more US states will likely follow suit this year, with Texas potentially being the first.  Additionally, he previously told CryptoSlate that state governments are rushing to pass legislation establishing their own BTC Reserves, as President-elect Donald Trump’s administration is considering an executive order to formalize this matter. The idea of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve gained traction following Trump’s election. During his presidential campaign, he displayed a pro-crypto stance, and one of his promises was to create a BTC reserve in the U.S. Treasury. This idea was quickly backed by pro-crypto politicians, such as Senator Cynthia Lummis, who introduced legislation for such reserve called “The Bitcoin Act” and believes Trump could approve it in his first 100 days at the White House. Policy and oversight The council will likely coordinate with regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Treasury, to craft crypto policy and streamline enforcement efforts.  Trump’s team is also reportedly considering creating a “crypto czar” role to lead the council, with candidates such as former CFTC Chair Heath Tarbert, ex-Commissioner Brian Quintenz, and former SEC chief Christopher Giancarlo under consideration. The move comes as Trump promises to reverse President Joe Biden’s stringent enforcement actions. The administration is expected to prioritize executive orders that ensure crypto companies’ access to banking services, halt enforcement actions, and position the industry as a strategic economic asset.   Ethical concerns Critics, including consumer advocacy groups, caution against allowing the crypto industry to heavily influence policymaking, warning of potential conflicts of interest.  Some ethics considerations may delay appointments, though industry leaders argue that experienced voices are essential for crafting effective regulations.   Anchorage Digital CEO Nathan McCauley stated: “It’s absolutely the wise choice to put together a council of people who… understand how both the industry ought to be regulated and how to situate the industry to be a strategic asset.” The post Trump’s Crypto Advisory Council to setup promised Strategic Bitcoin Reserve – Report appeared first on CryptoSlate.

The incident, in which North Korean hackers stole 342,000 Ethereum (ETH), was among the most significant cyberattacks targeting a cryptocurrency platform. The stolen Ethereum, valued at $41.4 million in 2019, is now worth over $1 billion at current prices. The investigation South Korea’s National Police Agency’s investigation confirmed the involvement of North Korean hacker groups Lazarus and Andariel in the Upbit 2019 hack. These groups are notorious for large-scale cybercrime and have stolen more than $3 billion in cryptocurrency from 2017 to 2023. The confirmation marks the first time South Korean police have officially tied a significant hack to North Korean operatives. Police explained that the hackers laundered 57% of the stolen ETH by converting it into Bitcoin. The funds flowed through three North Korea-linked exchanges and 51 global platforms. After years of tracing blockchain activity and analyzing North Korean IP addresses, investigators identified patterns, including unique North Korean language usage. Support from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also contributed to uncovering the hackers’ operations. The recovered Bitcoin, which was traced to a Swiss exchange, has been returned to Upbit. Upbit scrutiny This development arrives as Upbit is under scrutiny from South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) over KYC-related violations. The FIU reports that the exchange could be implicated in as many as 600,000 compliance breaches. South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) has also flagged concerns over Upbit’s market dominance. The exchange accounts for nearly 20% of the 22 trillion won deposited in K Bank, raising questions about potential risks to the financial system. According to CoinMarketCap data, Upbit is the largest South Korean crypto trading platform, with a trading volume of around $6 billion.

This morning (UTC), Bitcoin Cash ($BCH) blew up 17% in the course of 24 hours. The surge was brief, though, and the coin’s 24-hour gains have since dropped to 8.1%. However, over the same period, the $BTC token representing the original unforked Bitcoin ledger only rose 3% and trades at $97,271 as of this writing.  Ethereum ($ETH) is between both Bitcoin tokens this week. It added 7.3% and currently trades at $3,339.  Based on its current price, Bitcoin Cash is trading higher than its five-month high of $485 but it needs to rally 45% to meet its 2024 high of $700. The coin is currently trading nearly $20 higher than its 30-day moving average. This is likely due to a whale purchase this morning, as indicated by the near vertical ascent on BCH’s graph.  The coin’s relative strength index (RSI) is 53 and falling, indicating holders are already cashing in from today’s 17% rally.   Bitcoin Cash ($BCH) is Bitcoin ($BTC) for Payments Bitcoin Cash ($BCH) and original Bitcoin ($BTC) are family. In fact, they were technically the same thing before 2017. However, that year, Bitcoiners formed two distinct factions around a software upgrade called Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 91.  The faction that forked from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash was in favor of larger block sizes, which reduced fees and allowed the network to process more transactions per second. However, bigger block sizes mean miners need more power to do their business. This makes mining only really viable for universities, private companies and other organizations. The added speed enabled Bitcoin Cash to become the cryptocurrency of utility for the big block supporters, who saw Bitcoin primarily as a means of payments. Original Bitcoin maxis see Bitcoin more as a store of value. As Bitcoin Cash Explodes, More Investors Join The $FLOCK! Bitcoin Cash is a stalwart of the cryptocurrency space. Given the long history and wide support, it’s fair to assume it’s here to stay.  However, as a member of the establishment, $BCH is not likely to sustain blistering rallies for long, as seen today when its 17% surge quickly cooled to an 8% rally Investors that are looking for projects with more explosive upside potential, reminiscent of crypto’s early days, can often find it in the weird and wonderful world of micro-cap meme coin ICOs, where many innovative new species of meme coin are just launching. One new presale is already creating a strong community while raising millions, and it hasn’t hit the open market yet. This fall, meme coin fans are piling into a new vote-to-earn (V2E) meme coin called Flockerz ($FLOCK). In little over a month, the presale has raised more than $2.6 million.    Touting itself as “The People’s Meme Coin,” Flockerz offers crypto fans unrivaled community-building incentives and staking rewards.  Holders of Flockerz (known as “The $FLOCK”) are members of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called Flocktopia, where they can draft and vote on governance and improvement proposals. This structure ensures community consensus dictates the decisions rather than an opaque centralized authority, like with Turbo. Some 25% of the project’s 12 billion $FLOCK meme coin supply is for staking, with the protocol offering stakes yield of 802% on the tokens they stake over a two-year period.   Shout out to The Flock!! Flockerz just passed the 2.5M milestone and The Flock looks like it's just getting started! The future of The Flock is looking bright!  pic.twitter.com/ZEzGWDsf6E— Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) November 20, 2024  Flockerz is a transparent and fully audited project.  That’s why Coinsult audited its smart contract, to give investors peace of mind. Furthermore, Flockerz is eyeing up listings on both centralized and decentralized exchanges (CEXs and DEXs), so it has global ambitions to join Bitcoin Cash. Join now.

The ETH/BTC ratio on major centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance and Coinbase has fallen to its lowest level since March 2021. The metric stood at 0.032, or 3.2%, on Nov. 21, a decrease of over 40% since the beginning of 2024, according to data from TradingView.  However, at the time of writing, the ETH/BTC ratio has recovered slightly and is now trading at 0.034.   ETH/BTC ratio, YTD. Source: TradingView Trump Re-Election Drives Bitcoin to New Highs The decline in the ratio, which has been noticeable since July, can be attributed to Bitcoin’s rise, fueled by the re-election of pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump on Nov. 5.  On Nov. 21, Bitcoin set a new all-time high, surpassing $98,300 for the first time. Market sentiment is bullish, with expectations that Bitcoin will reach $100,000 by the end of the year.

ETH Struggles Amidst Bitcoin’s Rally While Bitcoin has thrived, Ether has faced challenges. Despite the overall market rally, ETH has underperformed, declining by over 3% over the past week. However, it has recently started to recover, gaining 7% in the last 24 hours. In contrast to Bitcoin, U.S. spot Ether ETFs have experienced losses since Nov. 14. Investors appear to be favoring Bitcoin ETFs, with inflows reaching $829.5 million on Nov. 19 and $773.4 million on Nov. 20. Increased competition from networks like Solana (SOL), coupled with regulatory uncertainty, has also contributed to Ether’s underperformance. Decoupling of Bitcoin and Ether CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju noted in his X post from Nov. 19 that Ether is becoming less correlated with Bitcoin.  According to the CEO, the 180-day BTC-ETH Pearson correlation is at a three-year low. This means that a 10% rise in Bitcoin could now result in only a 3% gain for Ether. “Just because Bitcoin is strong doesn’t mean you should buy ETH,” said Ju.“Each asset is now following its own path.”  ETH is becoming less correlated with BTC.

Learn more.The postBitcoin Smashes Through $97,000 As Trump Team Signals At Firs-Ever White House Crypto Roleappeared first onCryptonews."," Bitcoin (BTC) surged to a new all-time high of $97,000, gaining nearly 30% over the past two weeks. The rally reflects growing optimism around Donald Trump’s pro-crypto policies, including his plan to create a “crypto czar” role in the White House.  This position aims to streamline cryptocurrency regulations, positioning the U.S. as a leader in digital asset innovation. Trump’s victory in the U.S. elections and the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts have revived investor risk appetite.  In addition, Bitcoin’s momentum is bolstered by BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, with strong trading volumes signaling increasing institutional interest. With Bitcoin’s market cap now at $1.86 trillion and global crypto market capitalization at $3.19 trillion, analysts forecast Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of November. Trump’s “Crypto Czar” Plan Explained Donald Trump’s proposal for a “crypto czar” focuses on creating a streamlined framework for cryptocurrency policies.  This position would coordinate with Congress, the SEC, and federal agencies to simplify regulations and promote blockchain innovation.  Potential candidates include Brian Brooks, a former Coinbase executive known for his crypto-friendly stance.  BREAKING: Trump’s team is exploring the creation of a White House role dedicated to cryptocurrency policy. It’s unclear if there will be a senior “crypto czar” role to oversee federal policy, but advocates are urging for direct access to Trump, sources said. pic.twitter.com/3pAXi8Aahy— Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNewsCom) November 20, 2024  Trump has pledged to remove SEC Chair Gary Gensler and appoint leadership more supportive of digital assets. The goal is to foster innovation, making the U.S. a global hub for blockchain technology.  The crypto industry has responded positively to these developments, viewing them as steps toward a friendlier regulatory environment that could accelerate adoption. Bitcoin Ascending Triangle Breakout; What’s Next?  Bitcoin has broken out of an ascending triangle pattern, confirming a bullish move above $93,400. This breakout pushed BTC/USD toward $98,400, where resistance is slowing momentum.  The RSI at 68.79 indicates overbought conditions, suggesting limited immediate upside. A break above $98,400 could target $100,000, but consolidation near this level is likely.  On the downside, support sits at $96,350, with $94,850 providing additional safety if the price dips. The 50-period EMA at $93,327 aligns with the breakout zone, strengthening its importance as a support level. These levels are crucial for traders as Bitcoin’s short-term direction hinges on a breakout above resistance or a pullback. Key Points:  Resistance: $98,400; next target: $100,000. Immediate support: $96,350; secondary support: $94,850.

The final quarter of the year appears to be playing to historical trends, with Bitcoin traditionally seeing the brunt of its gains in the final two months. November alone has brought a 45.85% increase so far. Interest in Bitcoin isn’t limited to institutions, though. The asset has experienced an 18.5% rise in trading volume today, reaching a total of $91 billion. MicroStrategy Flips ‘Magnificent 7’ With Bitcoin Buy Ramp-Up MicroStrategy recorded volumes of $33.27 billion, trailing only artificial intelligence (AI) juggernaut Nvidia Corp. NVDA, at one point flipping Nvidia’s trading volume. The Michael Saylor-led firm surpassed all other members of the “Magnificent 7” group, including the likes of Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc. TSLA and Apple Inc. AAPL.  Wow $MSTR is the most traded stock in America today.. to best $TSLA and $NVDA is crazy. It's been years since a stock has traded more than one of those two (it may have actually been $GME to last do it). It's also about double $SPY! Wild times.. pic.twitter.com/bUr8nycMX3— Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 20, 2024  The rise has been attributed to MicroStrategy’s leading institutional adoption this cycle under Saylor’s direction, bolstered by the Wednesday announcement to upscale its Bitcoin acquisition plans from $1.75 billion to $2.6 billion.  Just last week, Saylor claimed he does not predict “any near-term threats on the horizon” for the cryptocurrency in conversation with CNBC, noting he “Would be surprised” if Bitcoin misses $100,000 before 2025. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Why is Saylor so Confident on $100K Significantly, technical indicators support the potential for a Bitcoin price in excess of $100,000, though the road ahead may not be as smooth as it has been thus far. These large targets come as Bitcoin continues on its breakout path from a bullish cup-and-handle pattern forming since November 2021. BTC / USDT 1W chart, cup-and-handle pattern breakout. Source: Binance. Given the pattern materialises, a conservative price target of $120,000 seems credible running into 2025 – a 23% increase from current prices. Though, the current momentum may seem somewhat unfounded as it has yet to discover its technical support. Therefore, as the Relative Strenght Index runs further into overbought territory at 75, a correction seems natural and healthy to reinforce the newfound high and discover supports to the uptrend.  If a retracement occurs, the zone between $97,175.85 and $89,903.29 seems like a more comfortable fallback position for the sustained continuation of the uptrend, though $100,000 seems likely before any downside is seen. Michael Saylor remains optimistic that, even with some downside, the Bitcoin price will not fall back to $60,000. “I don’t think it is going to $60,000, it is not going to $30,000. I think it is going to go up from here,” Saylor added. This New Low Cap Gem Could Rally Harder While a $100,000 Bitcoin price is certainly an appealing prospect, emerging opportunities hold the potential for quicker and more substantial gains.  Specifically, as “meme coin supercycle” sentiment takes hold and coins like $ACT and $Pnut experience sudden rises to prominence, analyst Murad Mahmudov notes a paradigm shift towards “movement coins” poised to reshape the crypto landscape. These community-centric meme coins hold exponential growth potential, forming ideologies and deep-rooted engagement. Something mirrored by newcomer, Flockerz ($FLOCK), the vote-to-earn meme joining the push toward decentralized governance, addressing the common criticism of meme coins being overly centralized.  Behind every strong meme coin is a stronger community intrinsic to its value. So why do these communities get side-lined in decision-making? Flocktopia, the DAO of Flockerz, aims to correct this imbalance, and the meme coin community has already shown its support, raising over $2.6 million in its presale so far!

Crypto News,U.S. Bitcoin ETFs Surpass $100 Billion in Assets Amid BTC Rally,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/u-s-bitcoin-etfs-surpass-100-billion-in-assets-amid-btc-rally/,U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have surpassed $100 billion in total net assets as Bitcoin continues its record-breaking surge.The postU.S. Bitcoin ETFs Surpass $100 Billion in Assets Amid BTC Rallyappeared first onCryptonews.," U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have surpassed $100 billion in total net assets as Bitcoin continues its record-breaking surge. Data from SoSoValue shows that as of Wednesday, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively held $100.55 billion, accounting for approximately 5.4% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. BlackRock’s IBIT leads the pack with $45.4 billion in assets, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC with $20.6 billion. Bitcoin Hits New ATH Bitcoin itself reached an all-time high, trading around $97,094, a 3.8% increase over the past 24 hours. The funds also experienced significant inflows, with $733.5 million recorded on Wednesday and $837.36 million the day before. BlackRock’s IBIT saw the highest inflows, receiving $626.5 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC attracted $133.9 million. Smaller contributions included $9.3 million for Bitwise’s BITB and $3.8 million for Ark and 21Shares’ ARKB. However, Grayscale’s GBTC reported no new inflows. Trading activity for bitcoin ETFs reached $5.09 billion on Wednesday, down slightly from Tuesday’s $5.71 billion. Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. continue to see outflows, with $30.3 million withdrawn on Wednesday, marking the fifth consecutive day of negative flows. Trading volume for ether ETFs dropped to $338.3 million, compared to $345.1 million the previous day. “The main driver behind BTC’s rapid rise is still institutional involvement. We have seen large net inflows into BTC ETFs this week. By Wednesday this week, BTC ETFs had achieved a net inflow of $1.8 billion,” Gracy Chen, CEO at Bitget, said in a statment.  Very interesting $BTC data.#Bitcoin whales are aggressively selling, whilst retail (spot ETFs) are aggressively buying.ETF flows must remain strong or else long-term holder sell pressure may catch up to the market. pic.twitter.com/oZSkCQT5mv— Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) November 21, 2024  Chen noted that MicroStrategy purchased 51,000 BTC last week at a cost of $88,617 each, and this week, they announced plans to raise $2.6 billion to continue purchasing BTC. “Well-known mining companies are planning to issue $850 million in convertible bonds to buy BTC. The massive spot buying power of traditional funds has caused BTC’s price to rise quickly.” Meanwhile, the open interest in BTC contracts has surged to $63 billion, with a daily increase of $6 billion. BTC’s implied volatility (IV) has risen to 60, indicating a higher probability of large market fluctuations in the future. Chen said that short-term capital has a tendency to lock in profits, which could lead to large price swings around the $100K mark. Bitwise Asset Management Takes Step Towards Solana ETF Bitwise Asset Management has filed to establish a trust entity for its proposed Bitwise Solana ETF in Delaware, marking an early step toward launching the fund as the crypto ETF market continues to see increased demand. If approved, Bitwise will join other asset managers like VanEck and 21Shares, which have also pursued Solana-focused ETFs. The filing follows Bitwise’s recent S-1 registration for an XRP ETF, the first fund proposal offering exposure to Ripple’s native cryptocurrency. The firm has experienced remarkable growth in 2024, with assets under management (AUM) reaching $5 billion as of October 15—a 400% year-to-date surge. Bitwise’s spot Bitcoin ETF, BITB, has also gained significant traction, drawing $2.3 billion in net inflows since its launch, second only to offerings by BlackRock and Fidelity.

Bitcoin Magazine,Safegcd’s Implementation Formally Verified,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/safegcds-implementation-formally-verified,Verifying an implementation of a novel modular inversion algorithm using a proof assistant. How guaranteeing Bitcoin cryptography is handled correctly is done. ,"IntroductionThe security of Bitcoin, and other blockchains, such as Liquid, hinges on the use of digital signatures algorithms such as ECDSA and Schnorr signatures. A C library called libsecp256k1, named after the elliptic curve that the library operates on, is used by both Bitcoin Core and Liquid, to provide these digital signature algorithms. These algorithms make use of a mathematical computation called a modular inverse, which is a relatively expensive component of the computation.In “Fast constant-time gcd computation and modular inversion,” Daniel J. Bernstein and Bo-Yin Yang develop a new modular inversion algorithm. In 2021, this algorithm, referred to as “safegcd,” was implemented for libsecp256k1 by Peter Dettman. As part of the vetting process for this novel algorithm, Blockstream Research was the first to complete a formal verification of the algorithm’s design by using the Coq proof assistant to formally verify that the algorithm does indeed terminate with the correct modular inverse result on 256-bit inputs.The Gap between Algorithm and Implementation The formalization effort in 2021 only showed that the algorithm designed by Bernstein and Yang works correctly. However, using that algorithm in libsecp256k1 requires implementing the mathematical description of the safegcd algorithm within the C programming language. For example, the mathematical description of the algorithm performs matrix multiplication of vectors that can be as wide as 256 bit signed integers, however the C programming language will only natively provide integers up to 64 bits (or 128 bits with some language extensions).Implementing the safegcd algorithm requires programming the matrix multiplication and other computations using C’s 64 bit integers. Additionally, many other optimizations have been added to make the implementation fast. In the end, there are four separate implementations of the safegcd algorithm in libsecp256k1: two constant time algorithms for signature generation, one optimized for 32-bit systems and one optimized for 64-bit systems, and two variable time algorithms for signature verification, again one for 32-bit systems and one for 64-bit systems.Verifiable CIn order to verify the C code correctly implements the safegcd algorithm, all the implementation details must be checked. We use Verifiable C, part of the Verified Software Toolchain for reasoning about C code using the Coq theorem prover.Verification proceeds by specifying preconditions and postconditions using separation logic for every function undergoing verification. Separation logic is a logic specialized for reasoning about subroutines, memory allocations, concurrency and more.Once each function is given a specification, verification proceeds by starting from a function’s precondition, and establishing a new invariant after each statement in the body of the function, until finally establishing the post condition at the end of the function body or the end of each return statement. Most of the formalization effort is spent “between” the lines of code, using the invariants to translate the raw operations of each C expression into higher level statements about what the data structures being manipulated represent mathematically. For example, what the C language regards as an array of 64-bit integers may actually be a representation of a 256-bit integer.The end result is a formal proof, verified by the Coq proof assistant, that libsecp256k1’s 64-bit variable time implementation of the safegcd modular inverse algorithm is functionally correct.Limitations of the Verification There are some limitations to the functional correctness proof. The separation logic used in Verifiable C implements what is known as partial correctness. That means it only proves the C code returns with the correct result if it returns, but it doesn’t prove termination itself. We mitigate this limitation by using our previous Coq proof of the bounds on the safegcd algorithm to prove that the loop counter value of the main loop in fact never exceeds 11 iterations.Another issue is that the C language itself has no formal specification. Instead the Verifiable C project uses the CompCert compiler project to provide a formal specification of a C language. This guarantees that when a verified C program is compiled with the CompCert compiler, the resulting assembly code will meet its specification (subject to the above limitation). However this doesn’t guarantee that the code generated by GCC, clang, or any other compiler will necessarily work. For example, C compilers are allowed to have different evaluation orders for arguments within a function call. And even if the C language had a formal specification any compiler that isn’t itself formally verified could still miscompile programs. This does occur in practice.Lastly, Verifiable C doesn’t support passing structures, returning structures or assigning structures. While in libsecp256k1, structures are always passed by pointer (which is allowed in Verifiable C), there are a few occasions where structure assignment is used. For the modular inverse correctness proof, there were 3 assignments that had to be replaced by a specialized function call that performs the structure assignment field by field.SummaryBlockstream Research has formally verified the correctness of libsecp256k1’s modular inverse function. This work provides further evidence that verification of C code is possible in practice. Using a general purpose proof assistant allows us to verify software built upon complex mathematical arguments.Nothing prevents the rest of the functions implemented in libsecp256k1 from being verified as well. Thus it is possible for libsecp256k1 to obtain the highest possible software correctness guarantees.This is a guest post by Russell O'Connor and Andrew Poelstra.

Bitcoin Magazine,"Newmarket Capital Launches Battery Finance, Bitcoin-Collateralized Loan Strategy ","Mon, 25 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/newmarket-capital-launches-battery-finance-bitcoin-collateralized-loan-strategy-,Battery Finance enables borrowers to use bitcoin as collateral for loans — without marking it to market — as a means to bring forward bitcoin’s value.,"Newmarket Capital recently closed the first investment deal for its new Battery Finance loan strategy, which enables borrowers to incorporate bitcoin into long-term financing structures as collateral.On November 7, 2024, Newmarket Capital, an institutional capital manager and Registered Investment Adviser completed a refinancing for the Bank Street Court apartment in Old City, Philadelphia, PA. The loan was collateralized by both the building and approximately 20 bitcoin.Newmarket Capital CEO Andrew Hohns is excited about not only setting his company’s new strategy in motion but the symbolism in the deal.“It's a building that is located less than half a block away from the first bank of the United States,” Hohns told Bitcoin Magazine. “Philadelphia has had a lot of firsts and innovations over the years, and we're proud to contribute another one to the list.”How The Battery Finance Strategy WorksBattery Finance enables bitcoin to be used as 10% to 30% of the collateral for loans alongside traditional assets. To bring this new strategy to life, Newmarket Capital partnered with Ten 31 to establish Battery Finance, a majority-owned subsidiary of Newmarket Capital that utilizes bitcoin in financing structures.Unlike other lending companies that let clients borrow against bitcoin with a risk of liquidation in the event that bitcoin’s price drops below a certain threshold, Newmarket Capital removes the risk and offers loan structures without a mark-to-market trigger.“As lenders, we are constructive on the long-term value of bitcoin and comfortable recognizing bitcoin as collateral without mark-to-market risk,” said Hohns.“We achieve this by incorporating bitcoin as a component of a broader collateral package alongside traditionally financeable assets. In this way, we have improved our downside through the introduction of bitcoin, an uncorrelated element — an asset that has had such a strong history of appreciation over time — in the collateral package.”Deals that employ this strategy can be structured differently. In some cases, a borrower can use bitcoin they’re already holding as collateral for a loan, while, in other cases, Newmarket Capital and the borrower purchase bitcoin as part of the loan’s structure. The latter is how the loan for the Bank Street Court building was structured.“It’s a $16.5 million building, and we offered the building owner a $12.5 million loan,” explained Hohns.“The use of proceeds was to pay off the existing financing, which was $9 million, to provide them with approximately two million dollars of CapEx for certain improvements to the property they wanted to make,” he added.“With the remaining $1.5 million dollars, we purchased just shy of twenty bitcoin as part of our combined collateral package.”(At the time of writing, that bitcoin had already appreciated 30% in value since it was purchased for the loan.)Unlike traditional loans which often lock borrowers in with prepayment penalties or a make-whole, the Bank Street Court financing can be paid off at any time with no penalty. To allow for this outcome, the borrower and the lender align to share appreciation on the upside from the bitcoin over the life of the loan. The longer the loan is outstanding, the greater the share of bitcoin appreciation that vests for the borrower, incentivizing borrowers to take a long term view on the bitcoin.Although the loan can be repaid at any time and the building released, the earliest that the bitcoin can be wound down is four years, in line with bitcoin’s four year rhythm. The loan carries a single digit interest rate and has a maturity of 10 years.Bringing Forward Bitcoin’s ValueHohns, a Bitcoiner himself, understands that other Bitcoiners have a low time preference, that they prioritize future economic well-being over more immediate gratification. However, he acknowledges that there are limits to this approach, which is why Newmarket Capital created the Battery Finance strategy.“The lowest time preference is not feasible for humans, because we have a finite life,” he said.“There's a point where we want to accomplish things with our lives. We want to grow our business or start a new business or just do the things that we all have passion for, like opening up a MakerSpace or a brewery or a bookstore — whatever the case might be. If you're just HODLing the Bitcoin, you're deferring those dreams,” he added.“By offering this financing tool, we can essentially serve as a mechanism to transform those time preferences, to bring forward the appreciation of the bitcoin by offering a significant amount of financing to accomplish whatever the real world goals borrowers have.”Target BorrowersBattery Finance is currently focused on working with borrowers who are interested in acquiring or refinancing commercial properties.“For the time being, we're inviting interest around loans that are, generally speaking, $10 million to $30 million dollars, which include 10% to 30% percent bitcoin with 70% to 90% percent traditionally-financeable income-producing assets,” explained Hohns.“This is a tool for both asset owners that want to redenominate some of the equity in theirexisting portfolio into bitcoin and its also a tool for Bitcoiners who want to obtain stable long-term financing supported in part by their bitcoin to acquire assets in the real world. This way, they can generate income and accomplish their goals while remaining invested in bitcoin.”In time, Battery Finance plans to service a broader range of customers.“We see broad applicability for this lending structure, including, over time, to people that are at different phases of their Bitcoin savings journeys,” said Hohns. “I hope that these kinds of products will develop into solutions that enable people to do things like finance a house or automobile with their bitcoin.”"
Bitcoin Magazine,You Can Now Invest In Bitcoin And Open-source Companies,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/you-can-now-invest-in-bitcoin-and-open-source-companies,The launch of Timestamp has really piqued my interest.,"     Follow Nikolaus On X Here  Bitcoin and open-source companies are some of the most exciting and innovative companies out there today. There are a handful of companies I personally think are going to exponentially grow as bitcoin increases in price and becomes a more established asset class, and if investing in them was available to non-accredited bitcoiners like me, it would be a no-brainer. But today, that may have just changed. Timestamp, a new platform that allows accredited and nonaccredited investors to invest in Bitcoin and open-source companies, has officially launched. Timestamp promises users they can invest in Bitcoin companies with “low investment minimums"" where users can review offerings, connect directly with the founders of these companies, and explore curated opportunities. Sounds pretty cool!The idea of making investing in Bitcoin and open-source companies more accessible to plebs really interests me, and I feel that many other Bitcoiners would agree. After working in this industry for a few years, I’ve definitely noticed that finding funding to support open-source companies and projects can be pretty difficult. But a platform that allows a lot more people to join in on investing in and supporting these companies could really be a game changer.At launch, users can now invest in the first batch of Bitcoin companies on the platform:CASCDR — a suite of AI services payable in Bitcoin Jippi — a gamified education app that helps Bitcoin beginners learn and earn Lightning Bounties — a Github-integrated platform that rewards software developers with Bitcoin for their contributions Shopstr — a global, decentralized marketplace built on Nostr Sovereign — a wallet built for the Bitcoin standardI’ll definitely be paying attention to what other companies are added to this platform in the future, and I think you should too.Over three years ago, I asked Timestamp’s founder and CEO, Dr. Arman Meguerian, to speak with me on stage at the Bitcoin 2021 Conference in Miami, and he joined me for a great conversation on Bitcoin maximalism with a few other great Bitcoiners. I am really excited and happy to see him launch this company after building it quietly through the bear market these last couple years, and looking forward to seeing all they achieve!

Bitcoin Magazine,"Jason ""Spaceboi"" Lowery's Bitcoin ""Thesis"" Is Incoherent Gibberish","Fri, 22 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/jason-spaceboi-lowerys-bitcoin-thesis-is-incoherent-gibberish,"This space is full of incoherent nonsense paraded around as deep and insightful analysis, but nothing is as absurd as Jason Lowery's Softwar ""thesis.""","      Jason Lowery’s Softwar “thesis” is a complete joke. It is a mix of incoherent, and subtly so, argumentation about cybersecurity and a repackaging of old topics of discussion that were thoroughly explored a decade before Jason Lowery became a name that anyone was familiar with in this space. First let’s look at the nation state mining “defensive weaponry” nonsense. Nation states being incentivized to mine, or support mining in their jurisdictions, is not some novel idea of Jason’s. It is a widely discussed dynamic going as far back as 2011-2013. Essentially every Bitcoiner since that time period who has been involved enough in this space to study and discuss where things were going in the long term has considered the dynamic of nations getting involved with mining if Bitcoin was actually successful in its growth long term. If Bitcoin ever became geopolitically relevant at a global scale, nation states were always going to take an interest in the mining sector. Nation states have an involvement in regulating all major commodities and their production, from gold to oil and natural gas. This is not some novel thesis or notion, it is common sense that was obvious to every random nerd who was in this space over a decade ago. The aspect of Bitcoin securing data however is patently absurd and incoherent. Bitcoin does not “secure” data. It can timestamp data, but that is not a magic guarantee of security. It does nothing whatsoever to protect data from exfiltration (being accessed by unauthorized people and copied), nor does it guarantee integrity or accuracy. All data on the blockchain is publicly accessible to anyone running a node. The idea of Bitcoin being useful for controlling access to information is just absurd. By its very nature any data put on Bitcoin is accessible by literally anyone. That is the entire bedrock it is based on, everything being open and transparent so that it can be verified. So let’s talk about paywalls, APIs, and nonsense gibberish like “digital energy.” Lowery’s next big jump is that charging in bitcoin for API calls somehow improves security. This is complete nonsense. Restricting access to an API is done for two reasons, 1) to manage resource use and stop them from being wasted, or 2) to only allow specific individuals you have authorized to access the API. Bitcoin can help with the former slightly, but does nothing whatsoever to help with the latter. Even monetizing an API with bitcoin doesn’t really help resource management protecting against DoS attacks. People can still send packets to your machine without a payment. Those packets still have to be diverted or managed by traditional DoS systems, which typically work by blackholing packets, or redirecting them away from your system. Bitcoin payments do nothing to get rid of the need to do such things. A money that anyone can get their hands on does nothing to restrict access to a system to only specific people that you want to access that system. Cryptography does that. Passwords do that. Technologies that already exist completely independently of, and have no need for, Bitcoin. Not to mention that even with such systems properly implemented, the hardware and software on the system being secured is ultimately what secures that system. People don’t fail to breach a server because “Bitcoin is protecting it,” they fail because the security systems on that server are properly implemented. Bitcoin, and even proper cryptography without Bitcoin, does nothing to keep a system secure when implementations are done incorrectly or flaws exist in those systems. That is the root of cybersecurity, and Bitcoin does absolutely nothing to change it. It does not help hardware be free from flaws, or security software be free from bugs. This entire aspect of his “thesis” is totally incoherent gibberish, that makes no logical sense at all. It’s a con to sucker in people who do not understand these things and build a reputation by hiding incoherence and incompetence behind clueless people cheerleading. And the whole “Bitcoin will stop wars” nonsense because nation states will compete with mining against each other? Laughable. Bitcoin mining will not change the geopolitical competition over agricultural lands, natural resources, tactical military positions, or anything that nation states go to war over. It is pure delusion. Jason Lowery does not have a “thesis”, he has a pile of incoherent garbage taped together around a single observation that an uncountable number of Bitcoiners had a decade before he ever entered this space. It’s a complete joke, and anyone buying it demonstrates they have zero critical thinking skills or familiarity with the relevant subject matter.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Legacy Media’s Transformation: Why Evolution Beats Extinction,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/legacy-medias-transformation-why-evolution-beats-extinction,"Legacy media is evolving as audiences demand transparency and independence. Bitcoin is paving the way for a new era of decentralized, trustworthy journalism.","     Follow Kristyna on X.  As a PR professional with over a decade of experience, I’ve witnessed firsthand the changing landscape of media. And let’s be honest: the claim that “legacy media is dead” feels more like a provocative headline than an accurate assessment. Sure, the traditional media model is shifting—especially in the wake of recent U.S. elections, where public trust in established outlets saw a noticeable decline. People are seeking alternative narratives and digging deeper to uncover the truth.Take this data point from Pew Research Center: “About one-in-five Americans—including 37% of adults under 30—say they regularly get news from influencers on social media.” This is not just a rejection of legacy media but a rejection of traditional gatekeepers perceived as increasingly out of touch with their audience’s needs. But to declare the death of the media is an oversimplification. What we’re witnessing isn’t an end but a transformation. The media is evolving to meet the demands of an audience hungry for something new. Transparency has become the cornerstone of this evolution. People want to know who is behind the editorial decisions, who owns the media they consume, and how that ownership influences the content. The old adage “he who pays the piper calls the tune” rings truer than ever.This isn’t a bad thing. Transparency can help rebuild trust in an era when skepticism toward corporate and political affiliations is at an all-time high.Let’s face it: true objectivity in journalism is a myth. Journalists are human, and with that comes inherent subjectivity. Even the decision about what to cover reflects ""selection bias."" For example, legacy media outlets often write about Bitcoin businesses only when the cryptocurrency's price is soaring or plummeting, perpetuating a volatile narrative that aligns with click-driven news cycles. This framing can overshadow the steady, transformative developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem.Once a story angle is chosen, journalists frequently seek sources to fit that narrative. That’s not to say journalists don’t strive for balance, but every choice—from framing to language—carries subjectivity. And that’s okay, as long as we’re honest about it. The audience deserves transparency over the illusion of neutrality.The media landscape is also diversifying, and specialized outlets are emerging to serve specific audiences. These platforms are experimenting with new business models and building stronger connections with their readers, who feel seen and heard. We’re also witnessing a shift from passive consumption to active engagement, with audiences supporting independent creators, subscribing to premium content, or directly funding investigative journalism.A prime example of this shift is the rise of long-form, unscripted conversations on platforms like The Joe Rogan Experience. A candid, hours-long conversation with a guest often achieves what a pre-recorded, heavily orchestrated interview on ABC cannot: authenticity. This format allows us to see public figures, including political candidates, as they truly are—unscripted, human, and occasionally flawed. It serves a vital purpose by showcasing the raw, unfiltered side of individuals, rather than relying on rehearsed phrases and carefully crafted talking points. In a world craving transparency, these platforms resonate because they prioritize authenticity over polish.This brings us to an essential question: does the traditional view of legacy media still hold up for global reporting or investigative journalism? Historically, legacy outlets have been considered the bedrock of these fields. However, investigative journalists in specific niches—such as healthcare or technology—are often independent. Global news often breaks on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) before legacy editorial teams have a chance to react. The speed, reach, and flexibility of new media channels are reshaping how we approach “big” stories.To understand how this shift might play out, consider WikiLeaks. When traditional financial institutions blocked donations to the organization, Bitcoin provided a lifeline. Its decentralized nature allowed people worldwide to fund WikiLeaks without intermediaries. This example illustrates how Bitcoin and blockchain technology can support investigative journalism, particularly in scenarios where traditional funding methods are compromised.Looking ahead, we could see audiences paying directly for investigative work, particularly for stories with global impact. A more decentralized funding model could enable journalists to report freely without fearing repercussions from advertisers, governments, or financial institutions.Bitcoin has the potential to help build a more trustworthy media ecosystem. Its transparency—every transaction recorded and immutable—could verify the authenticity of content, combat misinformation, and support independent creators. By decentralizing power, Bitcoin removes reliance on traditional gatekeepers and empowers audiences to directly support journalism they trust, fostering self-sovereign investigative journalism free from monetary influence and truly serving its audience.But this is only the beginning. It’s not just about Bitcoin; it’s about rethinking how media is produced, funded, and consumed. The responsibility also lies with us as consumers. By researching our sources, verifying information, and thinking critically about what we share, we play a direct role in shaping the media landscape.Now imagine tools that can be built with responsible AI. It has the potential to revolutionize media literacy and trust by acting as a ""Bullshit Meter"" that validates facts, detects bias, and uncovers hidden influences of ownership and sponsorship. Through tools like fact-checking algorithms, sentiment analysis, misinformation networks, and content mapping, AI can empower consumers to critically evaluate the media they consume. By integrating these capabilities into user-friendly platforms—such as browser extensions or educational tools—AI can make transparency and accountability more accessible than ever. While challenges like AI bias and industry resistance remain, leveraging this technology could fundamentally reshape how we produce, consume, and trust media in an era defined by skepticism and misinformation.The future of media isn’t about clinging to old models or dismissing them outright. It’s about transformation. It’s about a media that reflects the values of transparency, independence, and truth. And it’s up to us, as both professionals and consumers, to support this evolution—one piece, one platform, one choice at a time.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Gary Gensler’s Departure Is No Triumph For Bitcoin,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/gary-genslers-departure-is-no-triumph-for-bitcoin,"As the upcoming Trump administration is gearing up to establish a regulatory landscape facilitating full-on anything-goes multicoinery, and with Gary Gensler gone, we could well see the most atrocious scam coins proliferate and soar— before they inevitably implode.","     Follow Aaron on Nostr or X.  As I’ve explained previously, I don’t think Donald Trump actually gives a damn about Bitcoin; at best, he’s a shitcoiner who wants in on the scam. Having said that, it is fair to say that Trump adopted a pro-crypto stance during his campaign. And indeed, his promise at Bitcoin 2024 to fire Gary Gensler on “day one” of his presidency seems to have already resulted in the SEC chairman announcing his resignation.An optimistic scenario (as for example suggested by Trey Walsh) is one in which the Democrats now (also) adopt Bitcoin as part of their party platform. But given how many other seemingly neutral topics get unnecessarily politicized (the COVID vaccines are perhaps the best recent example of this), I wouldn’t be surprised to see the opposite happen.As the upcoming Trump administration is gearing up to establish a regulatory landscape facilitating full-on anything-goes multicoinery, and with Gary Gensler gone, we could well see the most atrocious scam coins proliferate and soar— before they inevitably implode. And as people over the next four years get rug pulled, dumped on, and otherwise defrauded, I could also easily imagine a political response from the other side of the aisle that fails to recognize the distinction between Bitcoin and the World Liberty Financials of the world altogether. They could turn against all of cryptocurrency even more than they already have— Bitcoin not excluded.Of course, this is all speculation; I have no crystal ball here. But in a few years from now, bitcoiners might find themselves in between polarized positions from both major American political parties. Nocoiners to the left of me, shitcoiners to the right, here I am, stuck in the middle with you.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,On-Chain Data Shows The Bitcoin Price Bull Run is Far From Over,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/on-chain-data-shows-the-bitcoin-price-bull-run-is-far-from-over,"Despite Bitcoin's recent rally, on-chain data reveals the bull market still has plenty of room to grow. Metrics like the MVRV Z-Score, NUPL, and Puell Multiple suggest Bitcoin is far from overheated, pointing to potential for significant upside in the months ahead. ","Bitcoin’s recent price action has been nothing short of exhilarating, but beyond the market buzz lies a wealth of on-chain data offering deeper insights. By analyzing metrics that gauge network activity, investor sentiment, and the BTC market cycles, we can gain a clearer picture of Bitcoin's current position and potential trajectory.Plenty Of Upside RemainingThe MVRV Z-Score compares Bitcoin's market cap, or price multiplied by circulating supply, with its realized cap, which is the average price at which all BTC were last transacted. Historically, this metric signals overheated markets when it enters the red zone, while the green zone suggests widespread losses and potential undervaluation.  Figure 1: MVRV Z-Score still at comparatively low values.  View Live Chart 🔍Currently, despite Bitcoin's rise to new all-time highs, the Z-score remains in neutral territory. Previous bull runs saw Z-scores reach highs of 7 to 10, far beyond the current level of around 3. If history repeats, this indicates significant room for further price growth.Miner ProfitabilityThe Puell Multiple evaluates miner profitability by comparing their daily USD-denominated revenue to their previous one-year moving average. Post-halving, miners’ earnings dropped by 50%, which led to a multi-month period of decreased earnings as the BTC price consolidated for most of 2024.  Figure 2: Puell Multiple reclaiming 1.00 has previously signified the start of bullish price action.  View Live Chart 🔍Yet even now, as Bitcoin has skyrocketed to new highs, the multiple indicates only a 30% increase in profitability relative to historical averages. This suggests that we are still in the early to middle stages of the bull market, and when comparing the patterns in the data we look like we have the potential for explosive growth akin to 2016 and 2020. With a post-halving reset, consolidation, and a finally a reclaim of the 1.00 multiple level signifying the exponential phase of price action.Measuring Market SentimentThe Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) metric quantifies the network's overall profitability, mapping sentiment across phases like optimism, belief, and euphoria. Similar to the MVRV Z-Score as it is derived from realized value or investor cost-basis, it looks at the current estimated profit or losses for all holders.  Figure 3: NUPL is still at lower values than our previous ATH set in March 2024.  View Live Chart 🔍Presently, Bitcoin remains in the ‘Belief’ zone, far from ‘Euphoria’ or ‘Greed’. This aligns with other data suggesting there is ample room for price appreciation before reaching market saturation. Especially considering this metric is still at lower levels than this metric reached earlier this year in March when we set out previous all-time high.Long-Term Holder TrendsThe percentage of Bitcoin held for over a year, represented by the 1+ Year HODL Wave, remains exceptionally high at around 64%, which is still higher than at any other point in Bitcoin history prior to this cycle. Prior price peaks in 2017 and 2021 saw these values fall to 40% and 53%, respectively as long-term holders began to realize profits. If something similar were to occur during this cycle, then we still have millions of bitcoin to be transferred to new market participants.  Figure 4: 1+ Year HODL Wave is still higher than any previous cycle highs.  View Live Chart 🔍So far, only around 800,000 BTC has been transferred from the Long Term Holder Supply to newer market participants during this cycle. In past cycles, up to 2–4 million BTC changed hands, highlighting that long-term holders have yet to cash out fully. This indicates a relatively nascent phase of the current bull run.  Figure 5: Long Term Holder Supply is still considerably higher than previous cycles.  View Live Chart 🔍Tracking “Smart Money”The Coin Days Destroyed metric weighs transactions by the holding duration of coins, emphasizing whale activity. We can then multiply that value by the BTC price at that point in time to see the Value Days Destroyed (VDD) Multiple. This gives us a clear insight into whether the largest and smartest BTC holders are beginning to realize profits in their positions.  Figure 6: The VDD metric indicates the largest and most experienced holders aren’t selling.  View Live Chart 🔍Current levels remain far from the red zones typically seen during market tops. This means whales and “smart money” are not yet offloading significant portions of their holdings and are still awaiting higher prices before beginning to realize substantial profits.ConclusionDespite the rally, on-chain metrics overwhelmingly suggest that Bitcoin is far from overheated. Long-term holders remain largely steadfast, and indicators like the MVRV Z-score, NUPL, and Puell Multiple all highlight room for growth. That said, some profit-taking and new market participants signal a transition into the mid to late-cycle phase, which could potentially be sustained for most of 2025.For investors, the key takeaway is to remain data-driven. Emotional decisions fueled by FOMO and euphoria can be costly. Instead, follow the underlying data fueling Bitcoin and use tools like the metrics discussed above to guide your own investing and analysis.For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out a recent YouTube video here: What's Happening On-chain: Bitcoin Update"

It is hard to contain my bullishness thinking about the United States purchasing 200,000 BTC per year. They essentially have to compete with everyone else in the world who is also accumulating bitcoin and attempting to front run them. There are only 21 million bitcoin and that is a LOT of demand. To put this into context, so far this year the US spot bitcoin ETFs have accumulated a combined total of over 1 million BTC. At the time of launch the price was ~$44,000 and now bitcoin is practically at $100,000. And that’s all ETFs combined. Imagine what will happen when just one entity wants to buy a total of 1 million coins, having to compete with everyone else accumulating large amounts as well?I mean MicroStrategy literally just completed another $3 BILLION raise to buy more bitcoin, and will continue raising until it purchases $42 billion more in bitcoin. The United States are most likely going to be purchasing their coins (if this legislation is officially signed into law) at very high prices. The demand is insane and only rising in the foreseeable future.With two months left to go until Trump officially takes office, it remains to be seen if this bill becomes law, but at the moment things are looking really good. As Senator Cynthia Lummis stated, “This is our Louisiana Purchase moment!” and would be an absolutely historic moment for Bitcoin, Bitcoiners, and the future financial dominance of the United States of America.This is the solution.

Meanwhile, they stubbornly refuse to follow MicroStrategy's proven winning strategy — convert those melting dollars to scarce Bitcoin!Microsoft announced a couple of months ago that it would buy back shares up to $60 billion; it seems like this did nothing to increase the stock price. Imagine if they had bought Bitcoin instead. That money would have been much more powerful if allocated to Bitcoin. The company would likely have added hundreds of billions in market cap.Just look at MicroStrategy. In just four years, they turned their $1 billion company into $100 billion by adopting Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. They are now the most compelling and successful story in corporate finance, with the best-performing stock in the last four years, beating every US company – even NVIDIA.Yet Microsoft clings to an outdated financial strategy, destroying shareholder value. Microsoft should follow its technology instincts, not faulty financial logic. There is no long-term viability in holding cash. I was listening to X Spaces yesterday, during which MicroStrategy's CEO Michael Saylor revealed that he offered to explain Bitcoin's benefits privately, but Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella rejected the meeting. Now, he is making a last-ditch appeal by presenting a 3-minute Bitcoin proposal to Microsoft's board. Earlier, the board already advised shareholders to reject assessing Bitcoin's potential upside. Nonetheless, I am interested to see how this meeting will turn out. Saylor is a great educator, so you never know. They should realise that no corporate treasury asset like Bitcoin can enhance enterprise value. Even a small $5 billion Bitcoin allocation could add tens of billions in market cap.Look, Microsoft, the choice is clear - hoard melting dollars or embrace uncensorable digital gold. Your shareholders are begging you to buy Bitcoin. It's time to listen before that $78 billion completely disappears. This is your fiduciary duty as Bitcoin continues mass adoption.This article is a Take.

Changes in […]The postSky-high Bitcoin funding rates show a leveraged yet bullish marketappeared first onCryptoSlate.","Bitcoin’s perpetual futures funding rate represents the cost traders incur to maintain long or short positions in the perpetual swaps market, with fees shifting between buyers and sellers based on market conditions. Positive funding rates suggest that long positions dominate, reflecting bullish sentiment, while negative rates indicate bearish sentiment as short positions dominate. Changes in funding rates provide insight into trader positioning and market risk. Spikes in funding rates often precede corrections, signaling heightened speculation and overleveraging. Conversely, negative or neutral funding rates during consolidations can signal potential entry points for strategic investors. Graph showing Bitcoin’s funding rate from Nov. 1 to Nov. 25, 2024 (Source: CoinGlass) Bitcoin’s current funding rate tracks the strong rally we’ve seen in November. Since the beginning of the month, both volume-weighted and open interest (OI)-weighted funding rates have remained consistently positive, reaching the highest levels in over a year. This sustained positivity shows the dominance of long positions, with traders paying a premium to maintain these positions. The market sentiment has been decisively bullish, as evidenced by traders’ willingness to incur higher funding costs in anticipation of continued price increases. The heightened funding rates show that leveraged long positions have contributed to the rally. Graph showing Bitcoin’s open interest-weighted funding rate from May 29 to Nov. 25, 2024 (Source: CoinGlass) The volume-weighted funding rate showed greater volatility than the OI-weighted rate, suggesting that trading volumes had a pronounced impact during these rapid price increases. This volatility reflects speculative activity, with traders aggressively opening positions to capitalize on Bitcoin’s momentum. However, earlier in the year, the situation was markedly different. From late June to mid-September, the market saw multiple instances of negative funding rates, particularly in the volume-weighted metric. This reflected bearish sentiment as Bitcoin’s price struggled to break out of a range-bound phase. During these months, traders heavily favored short positions, a cautious outlook that aligned with subdued price action. The shift to consistently positive funding rates in late Q3 marked a turning point, signaling a broader transition to bullish sentiment as Bitcoin’s price recovered. The volume-weighted funding rate demonstrated greater sensitivity to market speculation than the OI-weighted rate. This distinction became particularly apparent during high-activity periods. While the OI-weighted metric, being smoother, reflects broader market leverage trends, the volume-weighted rate captures short-term fluctuations driven by speculative traders. The increase in both metrics from late September through October revealed a gradual build-up of bullish sentiment. This trend suggests that Bitcoin’s rally was not purely driven by spot market activity but also by the growing influence of leverage in derivatives markets. The alignment of positive funding rates with sustained price gains highlights the role of leveraged traders in reinforcing bullish trends. Graph showing Bitcoin’s volume-weighted funding rate from May 29 to Nov. 25, 2024 (Source: CoinGlass) Despite this bullish momentum, the persistently high funding rates in November raises concerns about market overheating. When funding rates remain elevated for extended periods, it often signals excessive leverage, creating a fragile market environment. Overleveraging heightens the risk of cascading liquidations if prices suddenly reverse. Periods of high funding rates often precede sharp corrections as overextended traders are forced to exit positions. Conversely, the negative funding rates observed in July and September provided contrarian buy signals. During these periods, excessive bearish sentiment set the stage for price rebounds, highlighting the value of funding rates as a predictive tool.

Under the terms, investors will not pay any fees for HODL until the $2.5 billion threshold is reached or until Jan. 10, 2026—whichever comes first. This marks a significant extension from the previous fee waiver deadline of March 31, 2025, based on the $1.5 billion asset cap. According to Farside’s data, HODL’s net asset value is approximately $1.33 billion, reflecting a 124% increase since its inception. Once the $2.5 billion or January 2026 threshold is reached, investors will be subjected to a 0.20% sponsor fee. In the meantime, HODL remains the only zero-fee spot Bitcoin ETF available in the US. Kyle USruz, VanEck’s Director of Digital Assets Product, said: “January 10 marks the anniversary of the SEC’s approval of the first US-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded products—a watershed moment that we at VanEck had been working towards for close to a decade. It seems fitting to honor that milestone and extend the fee waiver on HODL with that date in mind.” Record inflows VanEck’s move comes amid the continued strong investor interest in Bitcoin ETFs despite their launch over 11 months ago. Data from CoinShares shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs saw record weekly inflows of $3.13 billion, pushing total inflows since mid-September to $15.2 billion. Year-to-date, inflows into crypto-related ETPs have reached $37 billion, primarily driven by inflows into Bitcoin. According to CoinShares, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) dominates the flow, with a year-to-date flow of $33.15 billion, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with flows of $11.5 billion. Conversely, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experienced net outflows of more than $20 billion during the same period. Nevertheless, these ETFs’ cumulative performance far surpasses that of US Gold ETUS, which garnered just $309 million in their debut year.

Key levels to watch: $93,500 support and $95,161 resistance.The postBitcoin Dances Around $100k, While Elon Musk Fires Shots At Jim Cramer For Suspected BTC Price “Reversal” Roleappeared first onCryptonews."," Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has experienced a sharp pullback after nearing the significant $100,000 milestone. Following its peak at $99,860 on Coinbase, Bitcoin reversed to trade at $93,839 as of November 25, 2024, marking a 0.88% decline during the day.  The sell-off coincides with a curious series of events involving financial commentator Jim Cramer and entrepreneur Elon Musk, highlighting the unpredictable influence of public figures on market sentiment. Elon Musk weighed in on the “Inverse Cramer” phenomenon with his characteristic wit, underscoring the ripple effect of Cramer’s endorsements on market behavior. Musk’s tweet featured a laughing emoji, symbolizing market skepticism about Cramer’s predictions. Bitcoin’s Retreat Below $95,000: Key Drivers The cryptocurrency’s failure to sustain its rally above $95,000 has been attributed to market consolidation and technical resistance. As of November 25, Bitcoin is trading at $93,839, down 0.88% on the day. This marks a critical test of the $93,500 support level, just below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $95,116. Market sentiment shifted sharply following Cramer’s endorsement, with traders cautious about a potential bearish continuation. The broader crypto market remains uncertain, with the US Dollar Index (DXY) holding steady near 107.00 and equity markets showing mixed signals.  Technical Outlook: Support and Resistance Levels  Immediate Support: $93,500, with further downside at $91,473 and $89,498. Immediate Resistance: $95,161, followed by $97,334 and $99,854. Indicators: The RSI is at 51.96, reflecting neutral momentum, while the 50 EMA at $95,116 acts as dynamic resistance.  A decisive move below $93,500 could expose Bitcoin to further declines, testing the $87,530 level. Conversely, reclaiming the $95,000 level may reinvigorate bullish sentiment, targeting $97,334 in the near term. Market Reaction to Jim Cramer’s Endorsement Jim Cramer’s bullish remarks on Bitcoin once again ignited discussions about the “Inverse Cramer” effect, where market behavior often contradicts his predictions. His statement, coupled with Bitcoin’s immediate price reversal, exemplifies the phenomenon. Elon Musk’s commentary added fuel to the discussion. With a tweet featuring a laughing emoji and a 100% symbol, Musk humorously highlighted the influence of Cramer’s proclamations on market dynamics. This lighthearted reaction underscores the broader skepticism surrounding Cramer’s endorsements. – You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034  Don’t Miss Out: Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) Presale Nears Its End Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) is making waves in the crypto market, with its presale raising over $40 million and offering investors a unique opportunity to secure tokens before major exchange listings.

The platform uses crowdfunding to make Bitcoin-related investments accessible to a broader audience, including non-accredited investors. Timestamp Opens Doors: Can Everyday Investors Now Join the Bitcoin Startups Revolution? It is open to accredited and non-accredited investors and will provide an alternative to traditional venture capital financing. According to Timestamp, investors will receive ownership stakes in the startups they support, similar to traditional equity investing.  Today marks the beginning of a new era for bitcoin.Introducing Timestamp: a regulated investment platform for bitcoin and open-source companies.Together, we will build the bitcoin standard.Explore the frontier: https://t.co/xlVzInYDm9 pic.twitter.com/ixKCyHwqfW— Timestamp (@Timestamp_BTC) November 25, 2024  Dr. Arman Meguerian, CEO of Timestamp, emphasized the platform’s mission to open doors for everyday investors.  “We have entered a new era where highly coveted investment opportunities are no longer reserved for an exclusive network of insiders,” Meguerian said. Timestamp enables users to explore curated offerings, interact directly with startup founders, and invest with low financial barriers.  The platform eliminates membership fees, sets minimal investment thresholds, and streamlines the process of reviewing projects, signing documents, and securely transferring funds. For startups, Timestamp provides a simplified fundraising approach. Founders can promote their campaigns under crowdfunding regulations, increasing visibility while fostering a community of investors who are also supporters. The platform charges a 7% commission only on successful campaigns. Founders can “soft launch” campaigns to gauge initial interest before proceeding to a full public launch after completing legal requirements. “As a US-based platform registered with the SEC and FINRA, we operate within a clear regulatory framework while providing founders exposure to a global network of Bitcoin-focused investors,” Meguerian said.  Although the platform exclusively supports Bitcoin-based startups, investments are currently limited to fiat currency.  However, Timestamp plans to introduce Bitcoin payment options in 2025, pending regulatory approvals and collaboration with banking partners. Bitcoin Innovation Booms: Can Timestamp’s Crowdfunding Platform Transform Startup Funding? The Bitcoin space has seen rapid innovation since the introduction of the Ordinals protocol in 2023 and the approval of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024. These developments have fueled institutional interest and catalyzed a surge in startups building solutions around Bitcoin’s network. Its decentralized nature and limited supply continue to attract interest from individual and institutional investors.  Timestamp’s platform builds on this growing interest, offering investors tools and opportunities to back projects in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Five startups are live on the Timestamp platform, working on projects ranging from Bitcoin wallets and payment solutions to a Bitcoin-inspired augmented reality game. Some of them include CASCDR, an AI service suite accepting Bitcoin payments; Jippi, a Pokémon GO-inspired Bitcoin education app; Lightning Bounties, a platform rewarding developers with Bitcoin; Shopstr, a decentralized marketplace on Nostr; and Sovereign, a wallet designed for Bitcoin users. The launch comes amid a challenging fundraising environment for crypto startups.  According to a recent Galaxy Research, crypto ventures raised $2.4 billion from venture capital firms in Q3 2024, a 20% drop from the previous quarter.

Bitcoin Magazine,Will December Surpass November’s Record-Breaking Bitcoin Price Increase?,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/will-december-surpass-novembers-record-breaking-bitcoin-price-increase,From Historic Gains to Future Growth: What the November Bitcoin Price Breakthrough Means for Investors in December.,"Bitcoin is closing out one of its most remarkable months in history, surging over $30,000 in November and marking a renewed bullish sentiment in the market. As we look ahead to December and beyond, investors are eager to understand whether Bitcoin's momentum can sustain itself into 2025. With macroeconomic conditions, historical trends, and on-chain data aligning in Bitcoin’s favor, let’s analyze what’s happening and what it could mean for the future.November’s Record-Breaking PerformanceNovember 2024 wasn’t just any month for Bitcoin; it was historic. Bitcoin's price rose from around $67,000 to nearly $100,000, an approximate 50% peak-to-trough increase, making it the best-performing month ever in terms of dollar increase. This rally rewarded long-term holders who endured months of consolidation after Bitcoin's all-time high of $74,000 earlier in the year.  Figure 1: Bitcoin has rallied over $30,000 in November.  View Live Chart 🔍Historically, Q4 is Bitcoin’s strongest quarter, and November has often been a standout month. December, which has also performed well in past bull cycles, presents a promising outlook. But as with any rally, some short-term cooling might be expected.  Figure 2: Q4 has historically been Bitcoin’s best-performing period.  View Live Chart 🔍The Role of the Dollar and Global LiquidityInterestingly, Bitcoin’s rise occurred against the backdrop of a strengthening U.S. Dollar Strength Index (DXY), a scenario that typically sees Bitcoin underperforming. Historically, Bitcoin and the DXY have maintained an inverse relationship: when the dollar strengthens, Bitcoin weakens, and vice versa.  Figure 3: Bitcoin rallied even as the strength of USD increased.  View Live Chart 🔍Similarly, the Global M2 money supply, another key metric, has shown a slight contraction recently. Bitcoin has historically correlated positively with global liquidity; thus, its current performance defies expectations. If liquidity conditions improve in the coming months, this could act as a powerful tailwind for Bitcoin’s price.  Figure 4: Global M2 YoY chart showing liquidity contraction.  View Live Chart 🔍Parallels to Past Bull CyclesBitcoin’s current trajectory is strikingly similar to past bull markets, particularly the 2016–2017 cycle. That cycle began with gradual price increases before breaking key resistance levels and entering an exponential growth phase.In 2017, Bitcoin’s price broke out from a key technical level of around $1,000, leading to a parabolic rally that peaked at $20,000, a 20x increase. Similarly, the 2020-2021 cycle saw Bitcoin rise from $20,000 to nearly $70,000 after breaking above the crucial YoY Performance threshold.  Figure 5: Current BTC performance showing parallels to price prior to breaking previous major resistance levels.  View Live Chart 🔍If Bitcoin can break out decisively from this historic level and above the key $100,000 resistance, we may witness a repeat of these explosive price movements as BTC enters its exponential phase of bullish price action.Institutional Adoption and AccumulationA key factor underpinning Bitcoin’s strength is the continued accumulation by institutions. Bitcoin ETFs are adding billions of dollars worth of BTC to their holdings, and corporations like MicroStrategy have doubled down on their Bitcoin strategy, now holding close to 400,000 BTC. Even with BTC rallying to new all-time highs, ‘smart money’ is scrambling to accumulate as much as possible to ensure they’re not left behind.  Figure 6: Institutions are not waiting for a retracement to accumulate BTC.  View Live Chart 🔍This institutional demand indicates growing confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, even in volatile market conditions. Such accumulation also tightens the available supply, creating upward pressure on prices as demand increases.ConclusionWhile December has historically been a strong month for Bitcoin, short-term volatility could temper gains as the market digests November’s sharp rally. Although given the aggressive accumulation we’re witnessing from institutional participants anything is possible.Longer-term, however, the outlook remains exceptionally bullish. The obvious level to watch is $100,000 as the next major milestone, which, if breached, could pave the way for a much larger rally in 2025. Bitcoin is entering one of its most exciting phases yet, with the stars seemingly aligning across macroeconomic, technical, and on-chain metrics.For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out a recent YouTube video here: The BIGGEST Bitcoin Month EVER - So What Happens Next?🎁 Black Friday: Our Biggest Ever SaleThe BEST saving of the year is here.

Bitcoin Magazine,Then They Fight You: Bitcoin and the United States’ Fiscal Crossroads,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/bitcoin-magazine-books/then-they-fight-you-bitcoin-and-the-united-states-fiscal-crossroads,"In this chapter from The Satoshi Papers, Avik Roy explores the looming fiscal crisis and presents three potential responses from the United States: restriction, paralysis, or assimilation. Could Bitcoin emerge as a solution—or spark further conflict?","IntroductionScholars dispute whether it was Mahatma Gandhi who first said, “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.” What cannot be disputed is that advocates of bitcoin have adopted the aphorism as their own.Bitcoiners commonly prophesize that at some point, bitcoin will replace the US dollar as the world’s predominant store of value.[1] Less frequently discussed is the essential question of exactly how such a transition might take place and what risks may lie along the path, especially if the issuers of fiat currency choose to fight back against challenges to their monetary monopolies.Will the US government and other Western governments willingly adapt to an emerging bitcoin standard, or will they take restrictive measures to prevent the replacement of fiat currencies? If bitcoin does indeed surpass the dollar as the world’s most widely used medium of exchange, will a transition from the dollar to bitcoin be peaceful and benign, like the evolution from Blockbuster Video to Netflix? Or will it be violent and destructive, as with Weimar Germany and the Great Depression? Or somewhere in between?These questions are not merely of theoretical interest. If bitcoin is to emerge from the potentially turbulent times ahead, the bitcoin community will need to contemplate exactly how to make it resilient to these future scenarios and how best to bring about the most peaceful and least disruptive transition toward an economy based once again upon sound money.In particular, we must take into account the vulnerabilities of those whose incomes and wealth are below the rich-nation median—those who, at current and future bitcoin prices, may fail to save enough to protect themselves from the economic challenges to come. “Have fun staying poor,” some Bitcoiners retort to their skeptics on social media. But in a real economic crisis, the poor will not be having fun. The failure of fiat-based fiscal policy will inflict the most harm on those who most depend on government spending for their economic security. In democratic societies, populists across the political spectrum will have powerful incentives to harvest the resentment of the non-bitcoin-owning majority against bitcoin-owning elites.It is, of course, difficult to predict exactly how the US government will respond to a hypothetical fiscal and monetary collapse decades into the future. But it is possible to broadly group the potential scenarios in ways that are relatively negative, neutral, or positive for society as a whole. In this essay, I describe three such scenarios: A restrictive scenario, in which the US attempts to aggressively curtail economic liberties in an effort to suppress competition between the dollar and bitcoin; a palsied scenario, in which partisan, ideological, and special-interest conflicts paralyze the government and limit its ability to either improve America’s fiscal situation or prevent bitcoin’s rise; and a munificent scenario, in which the US assimilates bitcoin into its monetary system and returns to sound fiscal policy. I base these scenarios on the highly probable emergence of a fiscal and monetary crisis in the United States by 2044.While these scenarios may also play out in other Western nations, I focus on the US here because the US dollar is today the world’s reserve currency, and the US government’s response to bitcoin is therefore of particular importance.The Coming Fiscal and Monetary CrisisWe know enough about the fiscal trajectory of the United States to conclude that a major crisis is not merely possible but probable by 2044 if the federal government fails to change course. In 2024, for the first time in modern history, interest on the federal debt exceeded spending on national defense. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO)—the national legislature’s official, nonpartisan fiscal scorekeeper—predicts that by 2044, federal debt held by the public will be approximately $84 trillion, or 139 percent of gross domestic product. This represents an increase from $28 trillion, or 99 percent of GDP, in 2024.[2]The CBO estimate makes several optimistic assumptions about the country’s fiscal situation in 2044. In its most recent projections, at the time of this publication, CBO assumes that the US economy will grow at a robust 3.6 percent per year in perpetuity, that the US government will still be able to borrow at a favorable 3.6 percent in 2044, and that Congress will not pass any laws to worsen the fiscal picture (as it did, for example, during the COVID-19 pandemic).[3]The CBO understands that its projections are optimistic. In May 2024, it published an analysis of how several alternative economic scenarios would affect the debt-to-GDP ratio. One, in which interest rates increase annually by a rate of 5 basis points (0.05 percent) higher than the CBO’s baseline, would result in 2044 debt of $93 trillion, or 156 percent of GDP. Another scenario, in which federal tax revenue and spending rates as a share of GDP continue at historical levels (for example, as a result of the continuation of purportedly temporary tax breaks and spending programs), yields a 2044 debt of $118 trillion, or 203 percent of GDP.[4]But combining multiple factors makes clear how truly dire the future has become. If we take the CBO’s higher interest rate scenario, in which interest rate growth is 5 basis points higher each year, and then layer onto that a gradual reduction in the GDP growth rate, such that nominal GDP growth in 2044 is 2.8 percent instead of 3.6 percent, the 2044 debt reaches $156 trillion, or 288 percent of GDP. By 2054, the debt would reach $441 trillion, or 635 percent of GDP (see figure 1). View the original article to see embedded media. Figure 1. US debt-to-GDP ratio: Alternative scenariosCredit: Avik Roy, https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/18398503/.In this scenario of higher interest rate payments and lower economic growth, in 2044 the US government would pay $6.9 trillion in interest payments, representing nearly half of all federal tax revenue. But just as we cannot assume that economic growth will remain high over the next two decades, we cannot assume that the demand for US government debt will remain steady. At a certain point, the US will run out of other people’s money. Credit Suisse estimates that in 2022 there was $454 trillion of household wealth in the world, defined as the value of financial assets and real estate assets, net of debt.[5] Not all of that wealth is available to lend to the United States. Indeed, the share of US Treasury securities held by foreign and international investors has steadily declined since the 2008 financial crisis.[6] At the same time that demand for Treasuries is proportionally declining, the supply of Treasuries is steadily increasing (see figure 2).[7] View the original article to see embedded media. Figure 2. Ownership of US TreasuriesCredit: Avik Roy, https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7641395/.In an unregulated bond market, this decline in demand paired with an increase in supply should lead to lower bond prices, signifying higher interest rates. The Federal Reserve, however, has intervened in the Treasury market to ensure that interest rates remain lower than they otherwise would. The Fed does this by printing new US dollars out of thin air and using them to buy the Treasury bonds that the broader market declines to purchase.[8] In effect, the Fed has decided that monetary inflation (that is, rapidly increasing the quantity of US dollars in circulation) is a more acceptable outcome than allowing interest rates to rise as the nation’s creditworthiness decreases.This situation is not sustainable. Economist Paul Winfree, using a methodology developed by researchers at the International Monetary Fund,[9] estimates that “the federal government will begin running out of fiscal space, or its capacity to take on additional debt to deal with adverse events, within the next 15 years”—that is, by 2039. He further notes that “interest rates and potential [GDP] growth are the most important factors” that would affect his projections.[10]For the purposes of our exercise, let us assume that the US will experience a fiscal and monetary failure by 2044—that is, a major economic crisis featuring a combination of rising interest rates (brought about by the lack of market interest in buying Treasuries) and high consumer price inflation (brought about by rapid monetary inflation). Over this twenty-year period, let us also imagine that bitcoin gradually increases in value, such that the liquidity of bitcoin, measured by its total market capitalization, is competitive with that of US Treasuries. Competitive liquidity is important because it means that large institutions, such as governments and multinational banks, can buy bitcoin at scale without excessively disrupting its price. Based on the behavior of conventional financial markets, I estimate that bitcoin will reach a state of competitive liquidity with Treasuries when its market capitalization equals roughly one-fifth of federal debt held by the public. Based on my $156 trillion estimate of federal debt in 2044, this amounts to approximately $31 trillion of bitcoin market cap, representing a price of $1.5 million per bitcoin—roughly twenty times the peak price of bitcoin reached in the first half of 2024.This is far from an unrealistic scenario. Bitcoin appreciated by a comparable multiple from August 2017 to April 2021, a period of less than four years.[11] Bitcoin has appreciated by similar multiples on many other occasions previously.[12] And if anything, my projections of the growth of US federal debt are conservative. Let us, then, further imagine that by 2044, bitcoin is a well-understood, mainstream asset. A young man who turned eighteen in 2008 will celebrate his fifty-fourth birthday in 2044. By 2044, more than half of the US population will have coexisted with bitcoin for their entire adult lives. A robust ecosystem of financial products, including lending and borrowing, will by then likely have been well established atop the bitcoin base layer. Finally, let us speculate that in this scenario, inflation has reached 50 percent per annum. (This is somewhere between the over-100 percent inflation rates of Argentina and Turkey in 2023 and the nearly 15 percent inflation experienced by the US in 1980.)In 2044, under these conditions, the US government will be in crisis. The rapid depreciation in the value of the dollar will have led to a sudden drop in demand for Treasury bonds, and there will not be an obvious way out. If Congress engages in extreme fiscal austerity—for example, by cutting spending on welfare and entitlement programs—its members will likely be thrown out of office. If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates enough to retain investor demand—say, above 30 percent—financial markets will crash, along with the credit-fueled economy, much as they did in 1929. But if the Fed allows inflation to rise even further, it will only accelerate the exit from Treasuries and the US dollar.Under these circumstances, how might the US government respond? And how might it treat bitcoin? In what follows, I consider three scenarios. First, I contemplate a restrictive scenario, in which the US attempts to use coercive measures to prevent the use of bitcoin as a competitor to the dollar. Second, I discuss a palsied scenario, in which political divisions and economic weakness paralyze the US government, preventing it from taking meaningful steps for or against bitcoin. Finally, I consider a munificent scenario, in which the US eventually ties the value of the dollar to bitcoin, restoring the nation’s fiscal and monetary soundness. (See figure 3.)   Figure 3. Three US fiscal scenarios1. The Restrictive ScenarioThroughout history, the most common response of government to a weakening currency has been to force its citizens to use and hold that currency instead of sounder alternatives, a phenomenon called financial repression. Governments also commonly deploy other economic restrictions, such as price controls, capital controls, and confiscatory taxation to maintain unsound fiscal and monetary policies.[13] It is possible—even probable—that the United States will respond similarly to the crisis to come.Price ControlsIn AD 301, the Roman Emperor Diocletian issued his Edictum de Pretiis Rerum Venalium—the Edict Concerning the Sale Price of Goods—which sought to address inflation caused by the long-running debasement of the Roman currency, the denarius, over a five-hundred-year period. Diocletian’s edict imposed price caps on over 1,200 goods and services.[14] These included wages, food, clothing, and shipping rates. Diocletian blamed rising prices not on the Roman Empire’s extravagant spending but on “unprincipled and licentious persons [who] think greed has a certain sort of obligation . . . in ripping up the fortunes of all.”[15]Actions of this sort echo throughout history until the modern day. In 1971, US President Richard Nixon responded to the imminent collapse of US gold reserves by unilaterally destroying the dollar’s peg to one-thirty-fifth of an ounce of gold and by ordering a ninety-day freeze on “all prices and wages throughout the United States.”[16] Nixon, like Diocletian and so many other rulers in between, did not blame his government’s fiscal or monetary policies for his country’s predicament but rather the “international money speculators” who “have been waging an all-out war on the American dollar.”[17]Even mainstream economists have convincingly shown that price controls on goods and services do not work.[18] This is because producers cease production if they are forced to sell their goods and services at a loss, which leads to shortages. But price controls remain a constant temptation for politicians since many consumers believe that price controls will protect them from inflation (at least in the short term). Since 2008, the Federal Reserve has imposed an increasingly aggressive set of controls on what economic historian James Grant calls “the most important price in capital markets”—that is, the price of money as reflected by interest rates.[19] As explained above, the Federal Reserve can effectively control interest rates on Treasury securities by acting as the dominant buyer and seller of those securities on the open market. (When bond prices rise because of more buying than selling, the interest rates implied by their prices decline, and vice versa.) The interest rates used by financial institutions and consumers, in turn, are heavily influenced by the interest rates on Treasury bonds, bills, and notes. Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed used this power narrowly, on a subset of short-term Treasury securities. But afterward, under Chairman Ben Bernanke, the Fed became far more aggressive in using its power to control interest rates throughout the economy.[20]Capital ControlsPrice controls are only one tool used by governments to control monetary crises. Another is capital controls, which hamper the exchange of a local currency for another currency or reserve asset.In 1933, during the Great Depression, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (popularly known as FDR) deployed a First World War–era statute to prohibit Americans from fleeing the dollar for gold. His Executive Order 6102 prohibited Americans from holding gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates and required people to surrender their gold to the US government in exchange for $20.67 per troy ounce.[21] Nine months later, Congress devalued the dollar by changing the price of a troy ounce to $35.00, effectively forcing Americans to accept an immediate 41 percent devaluation of their savings while preventing them from escaping that devaluation by using a superior store of value.[22]Capital controls are far from a historical relic. Argentina has historically prohibited its citizens from exchanging more than $200 worth of Argentine pesos for dollars per month, ostensibly to slow the decline of the value of the peso.[23] China imposes strict capital controls on its citizens—essentially requiring government approval for any exchange of foreign currency—to prevent capital from leaving China for other jurisdictions.[24]Increasingly, mainstream economists see these modern examples of capital controls as a success. The International Monetary Fund, born out of the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement, had long expressed opposition to capital controls, largely at the behest of the United States, which benefits from global use of the US dollar. But in 2022, the International Monetary Fund revised its “institutional view” of capital controls, declaring them an appropriate tool for “managing . . . risks in a way that preserves macroeconomic and financial stability.”[25]In my restrictive 2044 scenario, the US uses capital controls to prevent Americans from fleeing the dollar for bitcoin. The federal government could achieve this in several ways:Announcing a purportedly temporary, but ultimately permanent, suspension of the exchange of dollars for bitcoin and forcing the conversion of all bitcoin assets held in cryptocurrency exchanges into dollars at a fixed exchange rate. (Based on my predicted market price at which bitcoin’s liquidity is competitive with Treasuries, that would be approximately $1.5 million per bitcoin, but there is no guarantee that a forced conversion would occur at market rates.)Barring businesses under US jurisdiction from holding bitcoin on their balance sheets and from accepting bitcoin as payment.Liquidating bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by forcing them to convert their holdings to US dollars at a fixed exchange rate.Requiring bitcoin custodians to sell their bitcoin to the US government at a fixed exchange rate.Requiring those who self-custody their bitcoin to sell it to the government at a fixed exchange rate.Introducing a central bank digital currency to fully surveil all US dollar transactions and ensure that none are used to purchase bitcoin.The US government would be unlikely to execute all of these strategies successfully. In particular, the US will be unable to force all those who self-custody bitcoin to surrender their private keys. But many law-abiding citizens would likely comply with such a directive. This would be a pyrrhic victory for the government, however: The imposition of capital controls would lead to a further decline in confidence in the US dollar, and the cost to the US government of purchasing all the bitcoin custodied by American citizens and residents could exceed $10 trillion, further weakening the US fiscal situation. Nonetheless, the government in the restrictive scenario will have concluded that these are the least bad options.Confiscatory TaxationThe US government could also use tax policy to restrict the utility of bitcoin and thereby curtail its adoption.In a world where one bitcoin equals $1.5 million, many of the wealthiest people in the United States will be early bitcoin adopters. Technology entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan has estimated that at a price of $1 million per bitcoin, the number of bitcoin billionaires will begin to exceed the number of fiat billionaires.[26] This does not imply, however, that the distribution of wealth among bitcoin owners would be more equal than the distribution of wealth among owners of fiat currency today.Fewer than 2 percent of all bitcoin addresses contain more than one bitcoin, and fewer than 0.3 percent contain more than ten bitcoin. Addresses within that top 0.3 percent own more than 82 percent of all the bitcoin in existence.[27] (See figure 4.) Given that many individuals control multiple wallets, and even allowing for the fact that some of the largest bitcoin addresses belong to cryptocurrency exchanges, these figures likely underestimate the amount of bitcoin wealth concentration. They compare unfavorably to US fiat wealth distribution; in 2019, the top 1 percent held merely 34 percent of all fiat-denominated wealth in the United States.[28]If bitcoin ownership remains similarly distributed in 2044, those left behind by this monetary revolution—including disenfranchised elites from the previous era—will not go down quietly. Many will decry bitcoin wealth inequality as driven by anti-American speculators and seek to enact policies that restrict the economic power of bitcoin owners.

Distribution of bitcoin ownershipCredit: Avik Roy, https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/18651414/.In 2021, rumors circulated that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had proposed to President Joe Biden the institution of an 80 percent tax on cryptocurrency capital gains, a steep increase from the current top long-term capital gains tax rate of 23.8 percent.[29] In 2022, President Biden, building on a proposal by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, suggested taxing unrealized capital gains—that is, on-paper increases in the value of assets that the holder has not yet sold.[30] This would be an unprecedented move since it would require people to pay taxes on earnings they have not yet realized.It has long been argued that taxing unrealized capital gains would violate the US Constitution because unrealized gains do not meet the legal definition of income, and Article I of the Constitution requires that non-income taxes must be levied in proportion to states’ respective populations.[31] A recent case before the Supreme Court, Moore v. United States, gave the court the opportunity to make clear its position on the question; it declined to do so.[32] As a result, it remains eminently possible that a future Congress, supported by a future Supreme Court, will assent to the taxing of unrealized capital gains, and cryptocurrency gains specifically.Moreover, a presidential administration that does not like the constitutional interpretations of an existing Supreme Court could simply pack the court to ensure more favorable rulings. The FDR administration threatened to do precisely that during the 1930s. The conservative Supreme Court of that era had routinely ruled that FDR’s economically interventionist policies violated the Constitution. In 1937, Roosevelt responded by threatening to appoint six new justices to the Supreme Court in addition to the existing nine. While he was ultimately forced to withdraw his court-packing proposal, the Supreme Court was sufficiently intimidated and began approving New Deal legislation at a rapid pace thereafter.[33]A unique feature of US tax policy is that US citizens who live abroad are still required to pay US income and capital gains taxes, along with the taxes they pay in the country of their residence. (In all other advanced economies, expatriates only pay taxes once, based on where they live. For example, a French national living and working in Belgium pays Belgian tax rates, not French tax rates, whereas an American in Belgium pays both Belgian and US taxes.) This creates a perverse incentive for Americans living abroad to renounce their US citizenship. Every year, a few thousand Americans do so. However, they must first seek approval from a US embassy on foreign soil and pay taxes on all unrealized capital gains. In a restrictive scenario, in which the US Treasury is starved for revenue, it is easy to imagine the government suspending the ability of Americans to renounce their citizenship, ensuring that expatriates’ income remains taxable regardless of where they live.Right-Wing Financial RestrictionsWhile many of the restrictive policies described above have been proposed by politicians affiliated with the Democratic Party, Republican Party officials and representatives in 2044 may be just as willing to amplify populist resentment of the bitcoin elite. The United States is already home to a vocal movement of both American and European intellectuals building a new ideology broadly known as national conservatism, in which the suppression of individual rights is acceptable in the name of the national interest.[34] For example, some national conservatives advocate monetary and tax policies that protect the US dollar against bitcoin, even at the expense of individual property rights.[35]The USA PATRIOT Act was passed by overwhelming bipartisan congressional majorities weeks after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. It was signed into law by Republican President George W. Bush and included numerous provisions designed to combat the financing of international terrorism and criminal activity, especially by strengthening anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer rules, as well as reporting requirements for foreign bank account holders.[36]The PATRIOT Act may have helped reduce the risk of terrorism against the US, but it has achieved this at a significant cost to economic freedom, especially for American expatriates and others who use non-US bank accounts for personal or business reasons. Just as FDR used a law from the First World War to confiscate Americans’ gold holdings, in 2044 a restrictive government of either party will find many of the PATRIOT Act’s tools useful to clamp down on bitcoin ownership and usage.   The End of America’s Exorbitant PrivilegeBitcoin is remarkably resilient in its design; its decentralized network will likely continue to function well despite restrictive measures adopted by governments against its use. Today, for instance, a considerable amount of bitcoin trading volume and mining activity occurs in China, despite that country’s prohibition of it, because of the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) and other tools that disguise a user’s geographic location.[37]If we assume that half of the world’s bitcoin is owned by Americans and further assume that 80 percent of American bitcoin is held by early adopters and other large holders, it is likely that most of that 80 percent is already protected against confiscation through self-custody and offshore contingency planning. Capital controls and restrictions could collapse institutional bitcoin trading volume in the US, but most of this volume would likely move to decentralized exchanges or to jurisdictions outside of the US with less restrictive policies.A fiscal failure of the US in 2044 will be necessarily accompanied by a reduction in US military power because such power is predicated on enormous levels of deficit-financed defense spending. Hence, the US government will not be as capable in 2044 as it is today of imposing its economic will on other countries. Smaller nations, such as Singapore and El Salvador, could choose to welcome the bitcoin-based capital that the US turns away.[38] The mass departure of bitcoin-based wealth from the US would, of course, make America poorer and further reduce the ability of the US government to fund its spending obligations.Furthermore, US restriction of bitcoin’s utility will not be enough to convince foreign investors that US Treasuries are worth holding. The main way the US government could make investing in US bonds more attractive would be for the Federal Reserve to dramatically raise interest rates because higher interest rates equate to higher yields on Treasury securities. But this would in turn raise the cost of financing the federal debt, accelerating the US fiscal crisis.Eventually, foreign investors may require the US to denominate its bonds in bitcoin, or in a foreign currency backed by bitcoin, as a precondition for further investment. This momentous change would end what former French Finance Minister and President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing famously called America’s privilège exorbitant: Its long-standing ability to borrow in its own currency, which has enabled the US to decrease the value of its debts by decreasing the value of the dollar.[39]If and when US bonds are denominated in bitcoin, the United States will be forced to borrow money the way other countries do: In a currency not of its own making. Under a bitcoin standard, future devaluations of the US dollar would increase, rather than decrease, the value of America’s obligations to its creditors. America’s creditors—holders of US government bonds—would then be in a position to demand various austerity measures, such as requiring that the US close its budget deficits through a combination of large tax increases and spending cuts to Medicare, Social Security, national defense, and other federal programs.A substantial decline in America’s ability to fund its military would have profound geopolitical implications. A century ago, when the United States eclipsed the United Kingdom as the world’s leading power, the transition was relatively benign. We have no assurances that a future transition will work the same way. Historically, multipolar environments with competing great powers are frequently recipes for world wars.[40]2. The Palsied ScenarioIn medicine, a palsy is a form of paralysis accompanied by involuntary tremors. This term accurately describes my second scenario, in which the macroeconomic tremors accompanying bitcoin’s rise are paired in the US with partisan polarization, bureaucratic conflict, and diminishing American power. In the palsied scenario, the US is unable to act aggressively against bitcoin, but neither is it able to get its fiscal house in order.Today, partisan polarization in the US is at a modern high.[41] Republicans and Democrats are increasingly sorted by cultural factors: Republicans are disproportionately rural, high school–educated, and white; Democrats are more urban, college-educated, and nonwhite. Independents, who now make up a plurality of the electorate, are forced to choose among the candidates selected for general elections by Republican and Democratic base voters in partisan primaries.[42]While we can hope that these trends reverse over time, there are reasons to believe they will not. Among other factors, the accelerating development of software capabilities that manipulate behavior at scale, including artificial intelligence—for all of their promise—brings substantial risks in the political sphere. The potential for deepfakes and other forms of mass deception could reduce trust in political parties, elections, and government institutions while further fragmenting the US political environment into smaller subcultural communities. The cumulative effect of this fragmentation may be the inability to achieve consensus on most issues, let alone controversial ones such as reducing federal entitlement spending.In the palsied scenario, the US government is unable in 2044 to enact most of the restrictive measures described in the previous section. For example, paralysis could prevent Congress and the Federal Reserve from developing a central bank digital currency because of adamant opposition from activists but especially from depository banking institutions, who correctly view such a currency as a mortal threat to their business models. (A retail central bank digital currency obviates the need for individuals and businesses to deposit their money at banks because they could instead hold accounts directly at the Federal Reserve.)[43]Similarly, in the palsied scenario, Congress would be unable in 2044 to enact confiscatory taxes against bitcoin holders and the wealthy more broadly. Congress would fail to enact these policies for the same reasons it has failed to date: Concerns about such taxes’ constitutionality; opposition from powerful economic interests; and recognition that direct attacks on bitcoin-based capital will drive that capital offshore to the detriment of the United States.The palsied scenario is no libertarian utopia, however. In such a scenario, the federal government would retain the ability to regulate centralized exchanges, ETFs, and other financial services that facilitate the conversion of US dollars to bitcoin. If a majority of US-held bitcoin becomes owned through ETFs, the federal regulatory agencies would maintain the ability to limit the conversion of bitcoin ETF securities into actual bitcoin, heavily restricting the movement of capital out of US-controlled products.Most importantly, however, partisan paralysis means that Congress will be unable to solve America’s fiscal crisis. Congress will lack the votes for entitlement reform or other spending cuts. And by 2044, federal spending will continue to increase at such a rapid clip that no amount of tax revenue will be able to keep pace.Under the palsied scenario, Americans who hold bitcoin will be better able to protect their savings from government intrusion than under the restrictive scenario. They will not have to flee the country to own bitcoin, for example. This suggests that a significant proportion of the bitcoin community—both individuals and entrepreneurs—will remain in the United States and likely emerge as an economically powerful constituency. But the institutional environment in which they live and work will be frozen in dysfunction. Anti-bitcoin policy makers and pro-bitcoin political donors may end up in a stalemate.As in the restrictive scenario, in the palsied scenario the failure of the dollar-denominated Treasury bond market could force the United States to eventually get its fiscal house in order. In both cases, creditors may very well demand that the Treasury Department issue debt securities that are collateralized by hard assets. By 2044, bitcoin will have over three decades of validation as a preeminent store of value, and the American bitcoin community will be well positioned to help the US adapt to its new circumstances.3. The Munificent ScenarioThe munificent scenario is both the least intuitive and the most optimistic scenario for America in 2044. In the munificent scenario, US policy makers respond to the fiscal and monetary crisis of 2044 by actively moving to remain ahead of events, instead of being compelled to react to forces ostensibly outside of their control.The munificent scenario involves the US doing in 2044 something similar to what El Salvador did in 2019 or Argentina did in 2023 when those countries elected Nayib Bukele and Javier Milei to their presidencies, respectively. Though Bukele and Milei are different leaders with somewhat differing philosophies, they have both explicitly expressed support for bitcoin, with Bukele establishing bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador[44] and Milei pledging to replace the Argentine peso with the dollar[45] while legalizing bitcoin.[46] Milei has also used his presidential authority to significantly reduce Argentine public expenditures in inflation-adjusted terms, thereby achieving a primary budget surplus.[47]Imagine that in November 2044, the US elects a dynamic, pro-bitcoin president who pledges to adopt bitcoin as legal tender alongside the dollar (à la Bukele) and works with Treasury bondholders to reduce the US debt burden (à la Milei). One could imagine a grand fiscal bargain in which Treasury bondholders accept a one-time, partial default in exchange for Medicare and Social Security reform and an agreement to back the US dollar with bitcoin going forward, at a peg of sixty-seven satoshis to the dollar (that is, $1.5 million per bitcoin). Bondholders will likely be glad to accept a partial default in exchange for significant reforms that put the US on a sustainable fiscal and monetary footing for the future.Such reforms need not punish the elderly and other vulnerable populations. A growing body of research suggests that fiscal solvency need not be at odds with social welfare. For example, the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity published a health care reform plan that was introduced by Arkansas Rep. Bruce Westerman and Indiana Sen. Mike Braun in 2020 as the Fair Care Act. The plan would reduce the deficit by over $10 trillion in a thirty-year period and make the health care system fiscally solvent while achieving universal coverage.[48] The bill achieves this in two primary ways: First, it means-tests health care subsidies so that taxpayers are only funding the cost of care for the poor and the middle class, not the wealthy. Second, it reduces the cost of subsidizing health care by incentivizing competition and innovation. In these ways, the proposal increases the economic security of lower-income Americans while also increasing the fiscal sustainability of the federal government.   Similarly, the US could reform Social Security by transitioning the Social Security trust fund from Treasury bonds to bitcoin (or bitcoin-denominated Treasury bonds).[49] Such an idea is less practical in the era of high volatility that has characterized bitcoin’s early history, but by 2044 the bitcoin-dollar exchange rate is likely to be more stable. The post-ETF maturation of bitcoin trading, as large financial institutions introduce traditional hedging practices to the asset, has significantly reduced bitcoin’s dollar-denominated price volatility. Soon, bitcoin’s price volatility may resemble that of a stable asset such as gold. By collateralizing Social Security with bitcoin, the US could ensure that Social Security lives up to its name, providing actual economic security to American retirees in their golden years.The munificent scenario has additional benefits. The US government, by directly aligning itself with bitcoin’s monetary principles, could help make the twenty-first century another American one. It is highly unlikely that America’s primary geopolitical rival, China, will legalize a currency such as bitcoin that it cannot control. America’s culture of entrepreneurship, married with sound money, could lead to an unprecedented era of economic growth and prosperity for the United States. But this would require US leaders to place the nation’s long-term interests ahead of short-term political temptations.The Satoshi Papers is now available for pre-order in the Bitcoin Magazine Store.[1] A widely held view among academic economists is that for something to be considered money, it must serve as a store of value, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account. These features of money are not binary, but rather reside on a continuum; some forms of money are better stores of value, and others might be more widely used in trade and commerce. Bitcoin’s emergence as the premier store of value is the most significant development because this is what fiat currencies do most poorly. See Friedrich Hayek, Denationalisation of Money, 2nd ed.

Bitcoin Magazine,Will The Bitcoin Price Repeat the November 28 ATH Pattern of 2013 and 2017 in 2024?,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/will-the-bitcoin-price-repeat-the-november-28-ath-pattern-of-2013-and-2017-in-2024,"Historically, Bitcoin has achieved all-time highs (ATH) on November 28 in both 2013 and 2017. With November 28, 2024, imminent, investors are speculating whether Bitcoin could reach the $100,000 mark on this significant date.","Bitcoin consistently captures headlines, and over the years, November 28 has emerged as a pivotal date in its history. On this day in 2013 and 2017, Bitcoin surged to new ATHs, sparking global interest and investor enthusiasm. As we approach November 28, 2024, the question arises: Can Bitcoin replicate its past performance and soar beyond $100,000?You heard it here first... 🤞Nov 28, 2012 - First BTC Halving EventNov 28, 2013 - Bitcoin price breaks $1,000Nov 28, 2017 - Bitcoin price breaks $10,000 Nov 28, 2024 - Bitcoin price breaks $100,000? 👀@DavidFBailey send it! 💪🔥— Mark Mason | markmason.btc (@MarkMoneyMason) November 27, 2024  A Look Back: November 28, 2013, and 2017November 28, 2013: Bitcoin celebrated its first ATH by surpassing $1,000. This milestone was the result of a rapid ascent fueled by growing awareness, increased adoption, and excitement surrounding the disruptive potential of Bitcoin. At the time, Bitcoin was still a niche asset, but crossing the $1,000 barrier established it as a serious contender in the financial landscape, akin to a digital gold rush.November 28, 2017: Four years later, Bitcoin shattered the $10,000 mark, a significant psychological and market-defining milestone. The 2017 rally was driven by broader adoption, the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom, and rising interest from retail investors. By December, Bitcoin's price peaked near $20,000, concluding an extraordinary year that left a lasting imprint on the market.These dates have become legendary in Bitcoin lore, symbolizing moments when Bitcoin exceeded expectations and overcame skeptics.Why November 28? Understanding the Historical ContextThe prominence of November 28 in Bitcoin’s history is no mere coincidence. This date is intrinsically linked to Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycle, an event where the block reward miners receive is reduced by half. The first halving occurred on November 28, 2012, initiating a pattern that correlates with Bitcoin’s price cycles. Halvings decrease the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation, enhancing scarcity and often sparking bullish price movements in subsequent years. The 2012 halving set the stage for the 2013 ATH, while the 2016 halving paved the way for the 2017 bull run.With the most recent halving having taken place in April 2024, similar market dynamics are expected to unfold, leading to speculation that November 28, 2024, could witness another ATH.What Makes 2024 Special?Several factors contribute to the optimism surrounding a potential ATH on November 28, 2024:Post-Halving MomentumHistorically, Bitcoin experiences significant price growth in the 12–18 months following a halving. With the April 2024 halving now behind us, the anticipated supply shock has already begun to influence the market. Early indicators suggest a steady increase in demand, setting the stage for a potential record-breaking rally as we approach the end of the year.Increased Institutional AdoptionSince 2017, the investment landscape has evolved with major institutional players like BlackRock and Fidelity entering the Bitcoin market. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has injected billions of dollars in new liquidity, potentially propelling prices to unprecedented levels. In 2024, continued institutional interest and the launch of additional financial products further drove Bitcoin’s adoption and price.Geopolitical and Economic FactorsIn an era marked by inflation, currency devaluation, and banking instability, Bitcoin’s appeal as a store of value has intensified. Enhanced global adoption could further amplify its upward trajectory, positioning Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainties. Recent geopolitical tensions and economic policies worldwide may also contribute to increased investor interest in Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset.Presidential SupportAdding to this momentum is the election of Donald Trump as the first pro-Bitcoin U.S. President. President Trump's administration has been notably supportive of Bitcoin, implementing policies that favor adoption and integration. His pro-Bitcoin stance has further legitimized Bitcoin in the eyes of many investors and institutions, fostering an environment conducive to Bitcoin's growth.Corporate Treasury AdoptionAnother pivotal development in 2024 is the increasing trend of corporations adopting Bitcoin as part of their treasury reserves. Leading companies across various industries are diversifying their assets by allocating a portion of their treasury to Bitcoin. This shift not only enhances corporate financial strategies but also drives demand for Bitcoin, contributing to its upward price trajectory. Corporate adoption serves as a strong endorsement of Bitcoin's viability as a long-term investment and store of value.Market SentimentBitcoin thrives on narratives and investor sentiment. The aspiration to reach $100,000 aligns with the prevailing optimism and excitement as November 28, 2024, approaches. Social media discussions, technical analysis, and psychological milestones all contribute to building momentum. The community’s belief in Bitcoin’s potential plays a crucial role in driving its price forward.Challenges to ConsiderDespite the promising factors, reaching $100,000 by November 28, 2024, is not assured. Potential hurdles include:Macroeconomic Uncertainties: Global economic instability could impact investor confidence and market dynamics.Regulatory Challenges: Increasing regulatory scrutiny and potential restrictions could hinder Bitcoin’s growth.Market Volatility: Bitcoin remains inherently volatile, and unforeseen market shifts could disrupt upward momentum.Past Performance Limitations: Historical trends do not guarantee future results, and the market remains unpredictable.Will History Repeat Itself?Bitcoin’s historical performance on November 28 highlights its cyclical nature, offering a tantalizing glimpse into potential future trends. However, whether the 2024 pattern will continue remains uncertain. Achieving a $100,000 ATH would not only demonstrate Bitcoin’s resilience but also reinforce its status as a global financial asset.As November 28, 2024, approaches, one thing is clear: Bitcoin’s journey is ongoing. Whether it reaches $100K or surpasses it, this date could once again become a landmark moment in the annals of the world’s first digital currency.What do you think? Will Bitcoin hit a new ATH on November 28, 2024?"
Bitcoin Magazine,Some Bitcoiners Need To Grow Up And Focus On Their Own Shit,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/some-bitcoiners-need-to-grow-up-and-focus-on-their-own-shit,"Stop worrying about what other Bitcoiners are doing with their own bitcoin, worry about how to accomplish what you want with your own.","      Too much of the discussions around Bitcoin in the last year have been focused on how to use it. Or how it should be used. The entire Ordinals/Inscriptions mania over the last year has created a mob of Bitcoiners essentially shrieking like children about how other users decide to make use of their own bitcoin. This is completely detached and disconnected from the entire philosophy of Bitcoin’s design in the first place: to be an open access permissionless system. To be something you can’t be stopped from using. So much of the “technical discussions” over the last year beyond the developer community have focused heavily on technical mechanisms that can be used to stop other Bitcoin users from using Bitcoin. It is mind boggling to me that so many people in this space have made such changes, which are ultimately impossible to make without also crippling the uses of Bitcoin they arbitrarily put on the “approved” list, such a massive focus of theirs. It’s insane. Bitcoiners are actively trying to figure out how to censor other Bitcoiners because they do not like the way they use Bitcoin. There are two primary rationalizations for this. 1) That inscriptions are hurting people’s ability to bootstrap a new full node. This is false, the bottleneck of initial node syncing is not bandwidth (where inscriptions have made small increases in the data needed), it is verification of the data. Inscriptions don’t need to be verified. The more inscriptions there are, the cheaper verification costs are, because nodes just download it and verify nothing involving the inscription data when validating those transactions. 2) That it is increasing fees. Increasing fees are inevitable, and a result of a finite blocksize cap. Here is what Satoshi said in 2010 to someone complaining about fees: “It's only when you're sending a really huge transaction that the transaction fee ever comes into play, and even then it only works out to something like 0.002% of the amount. It's not money sucked out of the system, it just goes to other nodes. If you're sad about paying the fee, you could always turn the tables and run a node yourself and maybe someday rake in a 0.44 fee yourself.”These arguments are just broken, and completely missing the point. If you can stop someone from using Bitcoin, then Bitcoin has failed in its core value proposition. There is nothing that can regulate the use of a Bitcoin that actually functions how it is supposed to except economic pressure from fees. If anything but that can stop you from using the system, it doesn’t work. It is not censorship resistant. It has failed. People upset about the externalities of use cases that affect their own should do something productive, like focus on how to adapt their own uses of Bitcoin in a way that they still function properly in the face of people using it for other purposes. Instead, many Bitcoiners are simply crying to mommy and daddy to make the bad men stop using Bitcoin. The fact that this is still to any degree an argument present in the conversation is just sad at this point. It’s also one of the contributing factors to improvements to Bitcoin that could adapt their use cases to function properly in the face of others stalling. It’s time to grow up and stop crying about what other people are doing with their own property, and focus instead on how to do what you want with your own. This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,"Bitcoin is Neither Racist, Xenophobic, nor Misogynistic: A Response to Ideological Stereotyping","Wed, 27 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-neither-racist-xenophobic-nor-misogynistic-a-response-to-ideological-stereotyping-,"Kamala Harris’s rejection of Bitcoin deprives a vital resource to those in need globally, while Trump’s ‘Number Go Up” approach, may jeopardize America's core humanitarian values, like the refugee resettlement program, and ignore Bitcoin’s potential to aid vulnerable populations globally.","Just hours after the U.S. election results were announced, I received messages from friends filled with striking assumptions. Some congratulated me, mockingly saying, “Congrats, your side won for Bitcoin.” Others expressed disapproval with remarks like, “It’s pathetic!” and “I’m shocked that Americans just voted for Hitler.” One friend said, “You were lucky to find safety in the U.S. as a refugee under Biden’s administration. Refugees and asylum seekers will now face a harder time here, but, hey, it’s still good for your Bitcoin.” Many of these friends work in high-level corporate jobs or are university students. As a Green Card holder, I was not eligible to vote, but I recognize their huge disappointment in seeing their preferred candidate lose. Their frustrations were directed at me because they know I support Bitcoin and work in the space. I understand that making me a scapegoat says less about me and more about their limited understanding of what Bitcoin’s value represents.I’m aware that in this highly polarized political landscape, ideological stereotyping becomes evident—not only during election season but also in spaces where innovative thinking should be encouraged. A prime example of this ideological bias occurred during the Ohio State University commencement, where Chris Pan’s speech on Bitcoin was largely booed by students attending their graduation ceremony. I admire the courage it took to stand firm in front of over 60,000 people and continue his speech. My guess is that most of these graduating students have never experienced hyperinflation or grown up under authoritarian regimes, which likely triggered an “auto-reject”' response to concepts beyond their personal experience. I’ve encountered similar resistance in my own unfinished academic journey; during my time at Georgetown, I had several unproductive conversations with professors and students who viewed Bitcoin as a far-right tool. Once a professor told me, “Win, just because cryptocurrency (he didn’t use the term Bitcoin) helped you and your people in your home country doesn’t make it a great tool—most people end up getting scammed in America and many parts of the world. I urge you to learn more about it.” The power dynamics in academic settings often discourage open-minded discourse, which is why I eventually refrained from discussing Bitcoin with my professors.I've learned to understand that freedom of expression is a core American value. Yet, I’ve observed that certain demographics or communities label anyone they disagree with as 'racist.' In more extreme cases, this reaction can escalate to using influence to have people fired, expelled from school, or subjected to coordinated cyberbullying. I’m not claiming that racism doesn’t exist in American society or elsewhere; I strongly believe both overt and subtle forms of racism still persist and are well alive today.Although bias and inequality remain widespread, Bitcoin operates on entirely different principles. Bitcoin is borderless, leaderless, and accepting of any nationality or skin color all while without requiring any form of ID to participate. People in war-torn countries convert their savings into Bitcoin to cross borders safely, human rights defenders receive donations in Bitcoin, and women living under the Taliban get paid through the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin is not racist because it is a tool of empowerment for anyone who is willing to participate. Bitcoin is not Xenophobic because it gives those forced to flee their homes the power to carry their hard-earned economic energy across borders and participate in another economy when every other option is closed. For activists, often branded as 'criminals' by authoritarian regimes, it supports them through frozen bank accounts and blocked resources. For women, enduring life under misogynistic rule, Bitcoin offers a rare chance for financial independence.Going back to the U.S. election context, Bitcoin not only levels the playing field for people in the world’s most forgotten places and darkest corners, but it also opens new avenues for U.S. presidential candidates to engage with this growing community. President-elect Donald Trump has made bold promises regarding Bitcoin, signaling a favorable policy. In contrast, Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign reportedly declined to support the Bitcoin community. Grant McCarty, co-founder of the Bitcoin Policy Institute, stated, ""Can confirm that the Harris campaign was offered MILLIONS of dollars from companies, PACs, and individuals who were looking for her to simply take meetings with key crypto stakeholders and put together a defined crypto policy plan. The campaign never took the industry seriously."" I believe this is something most people may be unaware of, and confirmation bias often leads to the assumption that all Bitcoin supporters back every policy of the other side, including potential drastic changes to America's humanitarian commitments such as refugee resettlement and asylum programs, anti-trafficking and protection of vulnerable populations, and foreign aid and disaster relief.Most people around the world lack a stable economic infrastructure or access to long-term mortgages; they live and earn with currencies more volatile than crypto gambling and, in some cases, holding their own fiat currency is as dangerous as casino chips, or worse. The Fiat experiment has failed the global majority. I believe that Bitcoin and Bitcoin advocates deserve to be evaluated on their merits and work on global impact, rather than through the binary lens of political bias, misappropriated terms, or factually flawed yet socially accepted diminutive categorizing, which allows them to opt out of learning and evaluating assumptions.This is a guest post by Win Ko Ko Aung.

Bitcoin Magazine,Here’s How To Talk About Bitcoin At The Thanksgiving Table,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/heres-how-to-talk-about-bitcoin-at-the-thanksgiving-table,Share Resources; Don't Give Advice,"     Follow Frank on X.  It’s that time again — time to sit around the Thanksgiving table and catch up with loved ones while you have Bitcoin on the mind thanks to its recent price action.Some see this time as an opportunity to convince said loved ones that they should get on the Bitcoin rocket ship because it’s headed towards the moon.My humble advice: Don’t be that person.As you’ve probably learned if you’ve been in the Bitcoin space for some time now, bitcoin’s volatility can be quite unsettling, and, therefore, it isn’t for everyone. In other words, convincing sweet Auntie Jane to ape into bitcoin probably isn’t going to end well.While you may have personally benefitted from holding bitcoin for some period of time, it doesn’t mean others will have the same experience. Without some understanding of bitcoin’s cycles, most will panic sell when bitcoin’s price inevitably drops again.With that said, if Uncle Bob asks you about Bitcoin because he's heard that its price has gone up recently and he knows that you’re familiar with it, you can still point him in the right direction as far as onboarding resources (a far better strategy than becoming his personal Bitcoin advisor).Below are some examples of such resources:Simple Bitcoin — This Bitcoin education app presents you with information on Bitcoin via digestible learning modules, and it rewards you with sats when you get a passing grade on the post-module quizzes. Uncle Bob will be grateful that you made learning Bitcoin so easy for him.Yzer — Yzer, another Bitcoin education app, goes much deeper into the technology and economic philosophy that underpins Bitcoin. Its curriculum is more extensive than Simple Bitcoin’s, but it also rewards you with sats for completing quizzes with passing scores the same way Simple Bitcoin does. Nerdy Cousin Linda will be pumped to learn who Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig Von Mises were thanks to this app.THNDR Games — With THNDR, you can earn bitcoin just for playing games. Whether it’s Solitaire, Snake or Tetro Tiles (a play on Sodoku), THNDR can help Auntie Katrina stack sats for doing little more than playing video games on her phone. Plus, THNDR teaches her how to use a Lightning wallet.Gemini Credit Card — If you have a family member that’s into credit card rewards, tell them that with the Gemini rewards card they can earn bitcoin for everyday purchases, including 4% back on EV charging and gas at the pump, 3% back on dining out and 2% back on groceries. The kicker here is that there’s no membership free. This is great for cheap Uncle Bruce who showed up to Thanksgiving dinner empty-handed yet again this year.Fold — Fold offers you a checking account through which you can make your monthly payments and earn bitcoin rewards in the process. Imagine doing nothing more than paying your electric bill and earning some bitcoin in the process. Fold’s annual membership fee is $100, or users can pay $10 per month to use the service. Sign up now and get three months free. Great for Black-Friday-deal-searching Aunt Crystal.So, best of luck tomorrow, and remember to think twice before launching into philosophical diatribe on how Bitcoin is going to change the world or offering some ill-suited bitcoin-related financial advice based on little more than tidbits of information you’ve picked up while scrolling X.Your family and loved ones likely don’t care about your magic internet money. If they do ask about it, they probably only care about using bitcoin to speculate so to get more U.S. dollars.If your intentions are to get them to understand Bitcoin better and to slowly accumulate some without having to spend their hard-earned money on it, suggest the resources above and trust that some will find their way down the rabbit hole on their own.Happy Thanksgiving!This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,"No, Michael Saylor Doesn't Control Bitcoin ","Wed, 27 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/no-michael-saylor-doesnt-control-bitcoin-,his notion that Michael Saylor can single-handedly decide Bitcoin's fate just because of MicroStrategy's stack is simply ridiculous. ,"      I have to call BS on this claim that Michael Saylor is now Bitcoin's overlord and can single-handedly decide its fate. That's just ridiculous.During some drama about whether MicroStrategy's valuation makes sense, Vinny Lingham declared Saylor is the second most powerful person in Bitcoin after Satoshi Nakamoto. He argued Saylor can dictate terms by threatening to dump MicroStrategy's giant bitcoin stash if he doesn't get his way.While questioning MicroStrategy is fair game, the notion Saylor controls Bitcoin's destiny is intellectually dishonest drama-baiting. Vinny knows better.Bitcoin is decentralized, permissionless, and based on consensus. No single entity, not even the largest holder, can dictate terms.If influence correlated to Bitcoin holdings, the asset would have failed long ago. Governments could easily acquire 10% of supply with their printing presses and control Bitcoin — but that's not how it works.Saylor can't force protocol changes on Bitcoin. Even if he demands certain features, node operators hold the real power by enforcing consensus rules. If Saylor forks Bitcoin to make unilateral changes, the main chain persists while his fork dies, assuming that would be a shittier version. We've already seen this play out when early influencers like Roger Ver disagreed with the community. Bitcoin kept on trucking while Ver's alternative chain became irrelevant.Bitcoin's entire value stems from no one party controlling it. If whales could centralise decision-making by buying large portions, the whole experiment would fail. Thankfully, that's impossible by design.So, while Saylor provides a valuable perspective, his influence has limits. He cannot compel developers or miners or nodes to follow his preferred roadmap. His Bitcoin stack buys him a voice at the table, not absolute authority.No matter how many satoshis Saylor accumulates, he cannot unilaterally impose changes on a decentralized, leaderless network. Bitcoin derives resilience precisely from preventing such dominance.So enough with this bogus narrative that Michael Saylor is now Bitcoin's dictator. He's an influential figure, sure — but he doesn't control Bitcoin's fate any more than you or I do. That power remains dispersed.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Maximizing Bitcoin Accumulation – Beyond the Benchmark ,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/maximizing-bitcoin-accumulation-beyond-the-benchmark-,"Bitcoin has redefined the digital asset landscape, outperforming traditional markets year after year. But how can investors and institutions maximize their Bitcoin holdings beyond simple buy-and-hold strategies?","Bitcoin has consistently outperformed all major asset classes over the past decade, solidifying its role as the benchmark for digital asset investors. For those committed to Bitcoin’s long-term vision, the ultimate financial goal often shifts from acquiring more dollars to maximizing their Bitcoin holdings.Bitcoin is the Hurdle RateBitcoin is to digital assets what treasury bonds are to the legacy financial system—a foundational benchmark. While no investment is without risk, Bitcoin held in self-custody eliminates counterparty risk, dilution risk, and other systemic risks common in traditional finance.With BTC outperforming every other asset class in 9 of the past 12 years (by orders of magnitude), it’s no surprise that it has usurped treasury bonds as the “risk free rate” in the minds of many investors – especially those knowledgeable about monetary history and thus the appeal of Bitcoin’s verifiable scarcity.   Another way to phrase this would be that the financial objective of digital asset investors is to acquire more BTC rather than acquire more dollars. All investments or spending are viewed through the lens of BTC being the opportunity cost.MicroStrategy has demonstrated what this looks like in the corporate world with their new KPI: BTC Yield. To quote from their September 20th, 8-K form: “The Company uses BTC Yield as a KPI to help assess the performance of its strategy of acquiring bitcoin in a manner the Company believes is accretive to shareholders.” MicroStrategy has taken full advantage of the tools available to them as a multi-billion dollar public company: access to low interest rate debt and the ability to issue new shares. This KPI shows that they are acquiring more BTC per outstanding share despite the fact that they are engaging in the traditionally dilutive activity of new share issuance.Mission accomplished: they are acquiring more bitcoin.   But MicroStrategy has an advantage that the average fund manager or retail investor does not: they are a publicly traded company with the ability to tap into capital markets at little to no relative cost. Individual holders are unable to issue shares into the public market in order to raise capital and acquire BTC. Nor can we issue convertible notes and borrow dollars at a near zero % interest rate.So that begs the question: how can we accumulate more bitcoin? How can we have a positive ‘BTC Yield’?Bitcoin MiningBitcoin miners acquire BTC by contributing computational power to the Bitcoin network, and receiving a greater amount of BTC than what it costs in electricity to operate their machine(s). Now this is easier said than done. The Bitcoin protocol enforces a predetermined supply schedule using “difficulty adjustments” – meaning that more computational power dedicated towards Bitcoin mining results in the finite block rewards getting split up into smaller pieces.   The most effective Bitcoin miners are those that maximize their computational power while minimizing their operational costs. This is accomplished by acquiring the latest, most-efficient Bitcoin mining hardware, and operating with the lowest possible electricity rate.   Under current market conditions (as of 11/21/2024), 1 bitcoin has a price of ~$98,000. However, an Antminer S21 Pro mining with an electricity rate of $0.078/kWh is able to produce 1 BTC for ~$40,000 in electricity. This is an operating margin of nearly 145%. A business is typically considered to have “healthy profit margins” if they are in the 5-10% range – mining beats this easily. This is in spite of the fact that as of the April 2024 Bitcoin halving, they earn half as much BTC per unit of compute.Price Growth Outpacing Difficulty GrowthThe price of a financial asset – specifically bitcoin – is set at the margin. This means that the asset’s price is determined by the most recent transactions between buyers and sellers. In other words, the price reflects what the last buyer is willing to pay and what the last seller is willing to accept.This, in part, is what enables BTC’s notoriously volatile price action. A lack of sellers at price X means buyers must bid the price higher than X in order to find the next marginal seller. Inversely, a lack of buyers at price X means a seller must lower their ask to find the next marginal buyer. BTC can quickly move up or down based on a lack of sellers or buyers in a specific range.Consequently, the velocity at which the Bitcoin price can move is much higher than that of network mining difficulty. Substantial growth in network mining difficulty is not achieved by marginal bid/ask spreads, it is achieved by the culmination of ASIC manufacturing, energy production, and mining infrastructure development. There is not shortcutting the time and human capital necessary to increase the total computational power on the Bitcoin network.This dynamic is what creates opportunities for Bitcoin miners to accumulate vast amounts of bitcoin.   The chart here illustrates the explosive growth of Bitcoin mining profitability that takes place during bull markets. “Hashprice” measures the amount of revenue that Bitcoin miners earn per unit of compute on a daily basis. On a year-over-year basis, hashprice has increased by more than 300% at the height of each bitcoin mining cycle. This means that miners have had their profit margins more than triple in a 12-month span.Over the long-run this metric trends down as more entities begin mining bitcoin, miners upgrade to more powerful & efficient machines, and the block subsidy is cut in half every four years. However, during bull markets, the combination of the forces that are a positive catalyst for mining difficulty (and thus net-negative for mining profitability) pale in comparison to the rapid growth in the price of bitcoin.Price Volatility in Bitcoin Mining HardwareIn addition to wider profit margins during bull markets, Bitcoin miners have the simultaneous benefit of the fact that ASIC prices tend to move in tandem with the Bitcoin price. During the 2020 - 2024 cycle, the Antminer S19 (most efficient ASIC at the time) began trading at ~$24/T. By November 2021 – when the BTC price was peaking – they began trading for north of $120/T.   Bitcoin mining hardware retaining resale value is becoming increasingly the case with each new generation of hardware. In the early days of Bitcoin mining, technological advancements were swift and forceful – to the point that new ASICs would make older models obsolete overnight. However, the marginal gains of new ASICs have diminished to the point that older models are able to remain competitive for multiple years after release.Since the S19 was launched in 2020 and retains a non-zero market price today, it is reasonable to expect that the S21 line of machines will be able to retain value for even longer. This gives miners a significant leg-up when it comes to accumulating bitcoin, because the upfront cost of purchasing machines is no longer “sunk"". Their machines have a price, one that is correlated to bitcoin, and there is a resource available to get liquidity.   Blockware MarketplaceBlockware developed this platform to enable any investor – institutional or retail – the opportunity to gain direct exposure to Bitcoin mining. Users of the marketplace are able to purchase Bitcoin mining rigs that are hosted at one of Blockware’s tier 1 data centers and have access to industrial power prices. These machines are online already, eliminating lengthy lead times that have historically caused some miners to miss out on those key months in the cycle in which price is outpacing network difficulty.Moreover, this platform is built by Bitcoiners, for Bitcoiners. Which means that machines are purchased using Bitcoin as the medium of exchange, and mining rewards are never held by Blockware – they are sent directly to the users own wallet.Lastly, this provides miners with the aforementioned opportunity, but not obligation, to sell their machines at any time and price. This enables miners to capitalize on volatility in ASIC prices, recoup the cost of their machines, and accumulate more BTC faster than they would with a traditional “pure play” approach.This innovation removes the obstacles that have historically made hosted mining difficult, enabling miners to concentrate on the mission: accumulating more Bitcoin.For institutional investors looking for bulk pricing on mining hardware, contact the Blockware team directly.

Bitcoin Magazine,"Bitcoin Script: Focus On The Building Blocks, Not The Wild Geese","Tue, 26 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/bitcoin-script-focus-on-the-building-blocks-not-the-wild-geese,"Conversations around script upgrades to Bitcoin have become unfocused, irrational, and lost all serious context in the public square.","      Everything built on top of Bitcoin that you are aware of today is because of the primitives that Bitcoin Script supports. What do I mean by primitives? The basic components of a programming language that you can use to build actual applications to do things. No programming language was ever designed specifically for a single application, i.e. to build one program. They are designed to support basic primitives, like mathematical operations to manipulate data, or creating basic data structures to store data in a certain way, or operations to iterate through data as you manipulate it. Basic primitives are designed in such a way that developers can decide how to use them in order to create an actual application or program. The core design of the language doesn’t necessarily focus on what people will do with it, just that the primitives of the language can’t be combined in a way that will either 1) fail to accomplish what the developer is trying to accomplish without them understanding why, or 2) accomplish what the developer is trying to do in a way that is detrimental to the end user. No one designs a programming language thinking from the outset “Oh, we want to enable developers to do A, B, and C, but completely prevent them from doing X, Y, and Z.” (For more technical readers here, what I’m referring to here is the goal of what the developer is building, not low level technical details like how primitives are combined). Bitcoin Script is no different than other programming languages except in one respect, what it means for a certain combination of primitives to be detrimental to end users. Bitcoin has two properties that general computer applications don’t, the blockchain and what is executed on it must be fully verified by all users running a full node, and the entire progression of the system is secured by financial incentives that must remain in balance. Other than these extra considerations, Script is like any other programming language, it should include any primitives that allow developers to build useful things for users that cannot be combined in ways that are detrimental to users. All of the conversations around softforks to add covenants (new primitives) have devolved, at least in the public square, to ridiculous demands of what they will be used for. That is both not a possible thing to do, and also not the important thing to focus on. What will be built with Script is tangential to the risks that need to be analyzed, how things built interact with the base layer is the major risk. What costs will it impose, and how can those be constrained? (This is a huge part of the Great Script Restoration proposal from Rusty). How can those costs on the base layer skew incentives? This is a big part of the risk of MEV. These questions can be analyzed without focusing obsessively over every possible thing that can be built with a primitive. Primitives can be constrained at the base layer in terms of verification cost and complexity. Most importantly, in terms of incentives, what new primitives enable can be compared with things that are already possible to build today. If new primitives simply improve the trust model for end users of systems that can already be built that have an influence on the system incentives, without materially worsening the influence they have on those incentives, then there is no real new risk introduced. These conversations need to start focusing on what really matters, new functionality versus end user harm. They have derailed almost completely, again in the public square, not technical circles, into arguments over whether end users should be allowed to do things or not. That is not the conversation that matters. What matters is providing valuable functionality to end users without creating detrimental consequences. People need to focus on the primitives, and not the wild geese they hear in the distance. This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Use Bitcoin Easily And Privately With Cake Wallet,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/use-bitcoin-easily-and-privately-with-cake-wallet,Cake Wallet founder Vik Sharma and his team have created not only one of the most usable noncustodial Bitcoin and crypto wallets on the market but perhaps the one that offers the most transactional privacy. ,"Company Name: Cake WalletFounders: Vik SharmaDate Founded: October 2017Location of Headquarters: Saint Kitts and Nevis (and staff is remote)Number of Employees: 14Website: https://cakewallet.com/Public or Private? PrivateWhen Vik Sharma isn’t serving as the CEO of Liberty Steel, he’s focused on making bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies easier and more private to use via Cake Wallet.Sharma believes that a product must be user-friendly if it is to be adopted widely, which is why usability is at the center of the Cake Wallet mission.“The very broad mission of Cake Wallet is to bring cryptocurrency to the masses, to enable people to easily send, receive, hold, swap, on-ramp, and off-ramp crypto like you would with Venmo or PayPal,” Sharma told Bitcoin Magazine.The other primary dimension of the Cake Wallet mission is privacy.Sharma is a staunch believer in the idea of transactional privacy, something he came to value after experiencing just how public bitcoin is by default.Prioritizing PrivacySharma first started acquiring and mining Bitcoin in November 2013. (The ASIC miners he purchased from eBay and ran in the basement of his office building back then were minting him a cool 0.2 bitcoin per day at the time.)By the mid-2010s, Sharma wanted to do more with his bitcoin than just HODL it. He wanted to use it, and, at that time, it was mostly only illicit online marketplaces that accepted bitcoin.“Back then, it was hard to find anyone that took bitcoin,” began Sharma. “You had Silk Road, and then AlphaBay and other darknet markets, and I thought, ‘Let me check this out.’”After attempting to make a purchase on one of those darknet sites, Sharma was promptly notified that he’d crossed a legal line.“I sent Bitcoin directly from my Coinbase account to the darknet address,” said Sharma. “And, I kid you not, within seconds, I got an email from Coinbase saying ‘Your account has been suspended or deleted or canceled because you’ve violated some terms of service and you need to move your assets ASAP. I was like, ‘What the heck? How did they find out? There must be millions of addresses out there. Are they tracking millions of addresses?’” he added.“That woke me up to the transparent nature of Bitcoin.”Not only did Sharma’s experience using bitcoin in a darknet marketplace enlighten him as to just how public a ledger Bitcoin actually is, but it also introduced him to Monero (XMR).“There was this other special coin on AlphaBay called Monero, and I thought ‘Why not Litecoin or Ethereum or whatever was big at that time — why only Bitcoin and Monero?’” said Sharma.It was in pursuing an answer to this question that Sharma went deep down the Monero rabbit hole. His research led him to embracing the concept of transacting privately with cryptocurrency.And so he created Cake Wallet — a Monero-only wallet at its inception.Cake Wallet And Silent PaymentsCake Wallet launched in January 2018. Approximately one year later, Sharma added Bitcoin functionality to the wallet, as well.However, for over five years, Cake Wallet users had little ability to transact privately with bitcoin using Cake Wallet. The wallet didn’t have a Lightning implementation (Lightning offers more privacy than the Bitcoin base chain), nor many other privacy-enhancing features (aside from letting users add or select the node they want to use within the wallet).If a user wanted to make a private payment, they were better suited using XMR.But transacting with Bitcoin via Cake Wallet became somewhat more private (though still not as private as using Monero) in September 2024, when Cake wallet became the first bitcoin wallet to implement Silent Payments.Silent Payments enable users to receive bitcoin payments without revealing their public Bitcoin address. They’re like a P.O. Boxes for public Bitcoin addresses — static addresses that allow users to receive bitcoin without having to reveal their actual Bitcoin address — and they’re great for anyone doing fundraising or accepting payments via a public Bitcoin address.“When I read about Silent Payments, I liked it right away,” said Sharma. “I wish the Bitcoin community was more enthusiastic about it, because I think it's a great feature, especially if you're posting an address publicly, whether for donations or payments.”Because one of Cake Wallet’s most notable features, Bird Pay, hinges on users posting their address publicly, Silent Payments is a game changer.Unveiled approximately one year ago, Bird Pay enables Cake Wallet users to send bitcoin (or other crypto assets) to a contact using nothing other than an X handle.The receiver simply has to add their bitcoin address, which can be a Silent Payments address, to either their bio or a pinned tweet, and Cake Wallet can fetch the information from there.“CakeWallet will use the Twitter API, pull the address and send the payment to you,” explained Sharma, also noting that this same feature can be used via Nostr or Mastodon.“There’s a place where you should put your Silent Payments address,” he added.Cause For ConcernWhile the Bitcoin and Monero communities have embraced the privacy that Cake Wallet offers, Sharma is concerned that the U.S. federal government could turn out to not be so keen on it.In an era in which the government is cracking down on privacy-enhancing Bitcoin and crypto services, including Bitcoin Fog, Tornado Cash and Samourai Wallet, it seems difficult for anyone who’s creating such privacy-preserving crypto technology to not think twice about what’s at stake.“It does worry me — and not because we're doing anything wrong,” said Sharma. “But something could be twisted or construed to make it seem as if we are doing something wrong.”As a precautionary measure, Sharma has moved the headquarters of Cake Wallet overseas, from Florida to Nevis and Saint Kitts, something that Roger Ver advised him to do.He also discusses all updates to Cake Wallet with the company’s general counsel to make sure that Cake Wallet isn’t breaking any laws. While his lawyers have assured him he isn’t, he’s aware that skewed interpretations of laws and legal guidelines could potentially cause problems for Cake Wallet.“If you dig deep enough into the way the laws are written, they might say, ‘No, you're a money transmitter business, even though we're not,’” explained Sharma.“We're not touching users’ funds. We don't have access to them. Even though we built the app, once that app is on the user's phone, it's being generated on their phone, not on our servers,” he added.“But they might come back and say, ‘But it connects to your node initially.’ Who knows? I'm just using that as an example — even though we give the option right up front for users to not connect to our node.”Staying On MissionDespite a concerning legal backdrop, Sharma and the Cake Wallet team plan to stay the course and to remain mission-driven, focused on making Bitcoin both easy and private to use. “We have stuck to our ethos,” said Sharma.“The team will call each other out like, ‘No, we shouldn’t put this feature in because it violates this privacy or that privacy or could in the future. We have those debates internally all the time,” he added.And because Sharma has never taken VC money for Cake Wallet, the only people that he and his team have to answer to, aside from themselves, is their users.“Since we’re not beholden to a VC, investment firm or an angel investor who's looking for a return, nobody’s on top of us. We're able to do what our users want, what our community wants.”"
Bitcoin Magazine,Remembering John McAfee's Bullish Bitcoin Price Bet as we near $100K Milestone,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/remembering-john-mcafees-bullish-bitcoin-price-bet-as-we-near-100k-milestone,"As Bitcoin teeters on the brink of $100,000, we revisit John McAfee's audacious $1 million prediction, exploring whether the maverick's wild foresight was sheer madness or a stroke of genius—and if his timing was the only thing he got wrong.","     Follow Mark on X.  Ah, Bitcoin—a digital enigma that dances between brilliance and bafflement, much like a British summer deciding whether to rain or shine. As we teeter on the brink of the $100,000 milestone, it's impossible not to cast our minds back to the late John McAfee: antivirus mogul, libertarian firebrand, and a man whose eccentricity made the Mad Hatter look like an accountant.In the distant, carefree days of 2017—when masks were for surgeons and Zoom was just an onomatopoeia—McAfee made a proclamation that would make even Nostradamus raise an eyebrow. He boldly wagered that Bitcoin would soar to $500,000 within three years. And if not? Well, let's just say he offered to partake in a culinary act so unspeakable, it would make a cannibal blush. National television executives must have been on standby, salivating at the potential ratings bonanza.By 2019, instead of backpedaling like any sensible person who'd had one too many at the pub, McAfee doubled down. He upped his prediction to a cool $1 million per Bitcoin, asserting that the $100,000 mark would merely be the opening act—the financial equivalent of a warm-up comedian before the headliner brings the house down.Let's not forget McAfee's infamous bullish proclamation: that once Bitcoin hits the $100,000 mark, it would be like unlocking the floodgates of a financial Hoover Dam. At that pivotal price point, he believed, Bitcoin wouldn't just stroll to $1 million—it would sprint. At the time, there were no Bitcoin ETFs gracing the portfolios of traditional investors, no nations like El Salvador adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, no corporate titans like MicroStrategy hoarding it like digital dragons atop golden hordes, and certainly no whispers of U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserves. John didn't have a crystal ball—though I wouldn't have been surprised if he'd claimed to—but he keenly understood the game theory behind Bitcoin's design. He grasped that the underlying security, the allure, and the network effect of its mathematical genius were not just revolutionary; they were inevitable. For McAfee, it was never a matter of ""if"" but ""when"" the world would catch on.Critics scoffed, economists guffawed, and the rest of us watched with the same morbid fascination we reserve for reality TV and train wrecks. Was McAfee a visionary or just a man who'd spent a bit too much time sampling his own supply of eccentricity?Now, as Bitcoin flirts coquettishly with the $100,000 threshold, perhaps it's time to reconsider. Maybe old John wasn't entirely off his rocker—perhaps just teetering on the edge with a cocktail in hand. His timing was about as precise as a broken sundial, but the essence of his prediction might yet hold water.You see, McAfee understood something fundamental about Bitcoin: its potential to disrupt, to redefine, to turn the financial world on its head like a particularly aggressive yoga instructor. He saw the floodgates that could open, unleashing a torrent of innovation and, yes, wealth.Of course, trusting McAfee's predictions was always a bit like trusting a fox to guard the henhouse—or perhaps more aptly, trusting a software tycoon with a penchant for tropical escapades to give sound financial advice. But even a broken clock is right twice a day, and perhaps a maverick is right once in a blue moon.As we stand on this precipice, wallet in one hand and skepticism in the other, let's tip our hats to John McAfee. Not because he was necessarily correct, but because he had the audacity to dream big, to stake his reputation (and other unmentionables) on a future that seemed ludicrous to many.In a world that often feels like it's been scripted by a committee of pessimists, McAfee was a wild card—a joker in the deck who reminded us that fortune favors the bold, or at least makes for an entertaining story.So here's to you, John. Your timing was off, your methods were unorthodox, and your promises were—thankfully—unfulfilled in certain respects. But as Bitcoin edges toward that $100,000 milestone, perhaps your spirit of defiant optimism wasn't so misplaced after all.In the end, maybe it's not about the destination or even the journey, but the colorful characters we meet along the way who make the whole saga worth following. And if nothing else, McAfee ensured that the tale of Bitcoin was never short of intrigue, humor, and a dash of the absurd.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Fidelity Investments Director Shares Bitcoin’s Adoption and Valuation Models,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/fidelity-investments-director-shares-bitcoins-adoption-and-valuation-models,"Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity Investments, recently shared Bitcoin valuation models based on adoption curves and monetary policy scenarios, offering his perspective on the asset’s maturing role as both a network and a monetary innovation.","Fidelity Investments’ Director of Global Macro, Jurrien Timmer, continues to provide insightful frameworks for understanding Bitcoin’s valuation and growth. In a recent update, Timmer shared his take on Bitcoin’s adoption and value trajectories, illustrated by detailed charts that reflect both historical trends and hypothetical scenarios.Timmer’s models aim to simplify Bitcoin’s complex growth dynamics, bridging the gap between network adoption and valuation. “While the supply is known, the demand is not,” he stated, emphasizing the critical role of adoption curves and macroeconomic variables such as real rates and monetary policy.Adoption Curves: Slowing But Consistent GrowthDespite a slowdown in Bitcoin’s network growth, as measured by the number of wallets with a non-zero balance, Timmer noted that the trend still aligns with the steep power curve shown in his updated adoption chart. While the internet adoption curve has a gentler slope, Bitcoin’s adoption trajectory remains steeper, signifying its rapid but maturing growth.   Importantly, Timmer highlighted a key limitation in the measurement of wallet growth: the understated wallet/address count due to Bitcoin ETFs, which consolidate holdings into just a few wallets. “It’s very likely that the wallet/address count is understated,” he said, pointing out that ETFs obscure the broader distribution of Bitcoin adoption.Monetary Policy Meets Adoption DynamicsBuilding on his previous models, Timmer added a new layer to his valuation framework by incorporating money supply growth alongside real interest rates. The updated charts compare two hypothetical paths for Bitcoin’s valuation: one driven by adoption curves and real rates, and another that includes monetary inflation as a factor.   “Again, these are not predictions,” Timmer clarified, “but merely attempts at visualizing the use case on the basis of adoption, real rates, and monetary inflation.” This layered approach underscores how external macroeconomic forces, like monetary policy, could influence Bitcoin’s adoption and valuation.Why This MattersTimmer’s updated models reinforce Bitcoin’s position as a maturing financial asset. By combining historical S-curves, Metcalfe’s Law, and macroeconomic factors, he offers a comprehensive view of Bitcoin’s unique blend of network utility and monetary features. His work highlights the importance of adoption in driving Bitcoin’s value, while also demonstrating how real-world monetary conditions could shape its future.For Bitcoin proponents and skeptics alike, Timmer’s insights serve as a valuable framework for understanding the asset’s dual nature as both a network and a form of money. The inclusion of monetary inflation in his models further underscores Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against fiat currency debasement.The Road AheadAs Bitcoin continues to evolve, Timmer’s models provide a critical lens for tracking its development. Whether it’s the flattening of the adoption curve or the interplay between monetary policy and valuation, his analysis underscores the asset’s growing complexity—and its enduring relevance in the financial world.For investors, analysts, and enthusiasts, these insights are a reminder of Bitcoin’s transformative potential, even as its growth curve matures."

Named TON Teleport BTC, the bridge aims to harness Bitcoin’s foundational principles to enhance connectivity and utility within the TON ecosystem and the Telegram audience. TON Teleport BTC enables Bitcoin to function on Telegram as a tokenized asset, tgBTC, allowing users to hold and transact Bitcoin within Web3 mini-apps like EVAA and STON.Fi. This development eliminates the need for exchanges or custodians, streamlining Bitcoin transactions on Telegram and within TON’s ecosystem. Boosting Bitcoin Finance (BTCFi) on TON This integration hopes to activate Bitcoin activities on TON by driving liquidity, scalability, and trading. The tokenized Bitcoin, tgBTC, creates arbitrage opportunities across platforms and promotes active trading. It combines Bitcoin’s liquidity with TON’s DeFi infrastructure, offering yield generation to holders through low-cost, trustless, and transparent transactions. So, by enabling Telegram users to send Bitcoin as quickly as messages—at significantly reduced costs—TON aims to unlock new possibilities in decentralized finance and enhance Bitcoin’s utility across its $1.8 trillion liquidity market. Users can mint and withdraw tgBTC through an automated two-step process involving peg-in and peg-out mechanisms. According to the whitepaper: “In the peg-in process, users send their BTC to a specialized Bitcoin blockchain address connected to the TON Teleport BTC system. Following the confirmation of the transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain, a corresponding amount of tgBTC is issued on the TON blockchain.” TON’s adoption soars TON, a blockchain platform tied to messaging giant Telegram, gained significant traction in 2024. Telegram utilizes TON to facilitate ad revenue payments for channel owners and other functions, strengthening the connection between the two platforms. Although Telegram initially developed TON, the project faced regulatory challenges and was discontinued in 2020. However, a dedicated community of developers took over and has since advanced its growth. This year, TON’s momentum has skyrocketed. Its token price surged as Telegram deepened its involvement with the network. Additionally, the rise of crypto gaming, particularly on Telegram, has fueled this growth. Popular games like Hamster Kombat have attracted attention, showcasing the platform’s potential in the gaming sector.

According to a Nov. 29 filing, the company said it converted 14,200 ETH into approximately 515 BTC in an open-market transaction valued at $49.48 million. The firm stated that it had acquired the original Ethereum holdings at an average price of $2,777 per ETH, amounting to $39.45 million. Following this move, Boyaa’s total Bitcoin holdings rose to 3,183 BTC, with an average acquisition cost of $57,724 per Bitcoin. This strategic conversion positions Boyaa as Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, surpassing Japan’s Metaplanet, known for its aggressive acquisition strategy. Boyaa’s focus on BTC follows its announcement last year that it will invest up to $100 million in cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. The company aimed to diversify its treasury management strategy by reallocating idle reserve funds into digital assets. Bitcoin adoption gains momentum Boyaa’s Bitcoin acquisition highlights a growing institutional shift toward the flagship digital asset. Over the past month, companies such as Thumzup Media, Solidion Technology, Genius Group, and Rumble have also integrated the top crypto into their treasury strategies. This institutional shift aligns with broader movements like the push for a national Bitcoin reserve in the United States. Advocates, including President-elect Donald Trump, view Bitcoin as a valuable addition to traditional reserves. Senator Cynthia Lummis has even suggested selling portions of US gold reserves to acquire BTC, believing it could strengthen the country’s financial stability. Globally, nations such as Brazil and Poland are also exploring BTC’s potential role in reserve management. All of these developments occur amid BTC’s stellar market performance. With its value more than doubling and nearing the $100,000 milestone, analysts anticipate it will surpass six figures before year-end, solidifying its appeal as a strategic asset.

Offshore exchanges, particularly in Asia, have consistently dominated global trading activity, with platforms like Binance and Huobi driving liquidity and volatility. However, the US has always held a unique position as the most influential force in the crypto industry. It has historically set the tone for the rest of the world, shaping the development and perception of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. This dominance can be observed through the pricing discrepancies and supply distribution metrics that reflect the behavior of US-based market participants. Two key indicators — the Coinbase Premium and the US to The Rest Reserve Ratio — offer a window into the evolving role of the United States in the global Bitcoin ecosystem. These metrics track the premium of US exchanges over offshore platforms and the proportion of Bitcoin held by US entities relative to the rest of the world, illustrating regional demand and supply distribution. The Coinbase Premium is a proxy for US demand, reflecting periods when US investors drive Bitcoin’s price higher than on offshore platforms. Conversely, a negative premium often indicates that offshore markets dominate price discovery. Meanwhile, the US to The Rest Reserve Ratio shows accumulation trends of US-based institutions, exchanges, and custodians compared to global counterparts. Together, these metrics reveal the interplay between US and offshore markets and the underlying shifts in sentiment, regulatory influence, and institutional adoption. The impact the US presidential elections had on the market is clearly visible in the Coinbase Premium and reserve ratio data. These changes show how regional sentiment responded to the prospect of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment in the US. The Coinbase Premium chart reveals significant volatility in US demand in the past three months. The premium remained negative in early September, suggesting weaker buying pressure from the US, which indicates that offshore exchanges drove Bitcoin’s price. However, as Bitcoin’s price began to rise at the end of the month, the premium shifted, occasionally turning positive. Graph showing the Coinbase Premium Index from Sep. 1 to Nov. 28, 2024 (Source: CryptoQuant) The deviation reflects intermittent periods of strong US demand, likely driven by speculation on the outcome of the elections. Bitcoin saw a sharp rally in mid-October, yet the Coinbase Premium turned decisively negative, indicating that offshore entities, particularly in Asia, were the primary drivers of this price increase. The negative premium during this rally also suggests that US-based traders were engaging in arbitrage by taking advantage of lower prices on Coinbase Pro compared to offshore platforms like Binance. The US to The Rest Reserve Ratio tells a parallel story of rising institutional accumulation in the US. Despite the negative premium during October’s price rally, the reserve ratio steadily climbed, indicating that US-based entities added to their Bitcoin holdings. By late October, the reserve ratio saw a sharp uptick, coinciding with speculation around the US election and expectations of a pro-crypto administration. Following Trump’s victory on Nov. 5, the reserve ratio surged even higher, reflecting increased accumulation by US-based institutions and custodians. Graph showing the US to the rest reserve ratio from Sep. 1 to Nov. 28, 2024 (Source: CryptoQuant) Interestingly, the Coinbase Premium turned positive in late November, aligning with a stabilization in the reserve ratio. This shift indicates that US retail traders re-entered the market, causing an uptick in demand on Coinbase Pro. The renewed buying interest from US traders came as Bitcoin’s price stabilized around $95,000, showing how the announcement of favorable crypto policies boosted sentiment and demand within the US market. While offshore exchanges dominated price movements in earlier months, the steady rise in the US reserve ratio demonstrates growing institutional confidence and accumulation within the US This trend was amplified following Trump’s election and talks of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, which signaled a renewed commitment to positioning the US as a leader in the crypto industry. US-based entities’ steady accumulation of Bitcoin suggests a long-term shift toward institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. Trump’s policy announcements have reinforced this trend, likely accelerating the US’s position as a dominant force in Bitcoin markets. However, the negative Coinbase Premium during key price rallies highlights the ongoing influence of offshore markets, particularly in driving short-term volatility.

Crypto News,Top Russian Lawmaker Rules Out Creating a National Bitcoin Reserve,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/top-russian-lawmaker-rules-out-creating-national-bitcoin-reserve/,Russia’s most senior crypto legislation architect has ruled out the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve.The postTop Russian Lawmaker Rules Out Creating a National Bitcoin Reserveappeared first onCryptonews.," Russia’s most senior crypto legislation architect has ruled out the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve. In an interview with the country’s Parliamentary Gazette, Anatoly Aksakov, the Chairman of the State Duma’s Committee on the Financial Markets, said that Bitcoin would only be used in the budget “in 100 years’ time.” National Bitcoin Reserve? Maybe in 100 Years, Says Lawmaker Aksakov said the State Duma believes that “cryptocurrency is incompatible” with the country’s reserves, which remain based on gold and foreign currency. Anatoly Aksakov, the Chairman of the Russian State Duma’s Committee on the Financial Markets, speaking during an interview this week. (Source: Parliamentary Gazette/Screenshot) Not everyone in Moscow appears to agree with Aksakov, as the gazette’s interviewer noted that “some” Russian “legislators” have suggested creating a “stash of” crypto in “the state Treasury.” However, the lawmaker voiced his disdain for these proposals, claiming that Moscow needed to exercise “caution” with crypto adoption.   “There are private individuals behind Bitcoin. And it is still unclear what procedures are used to issue it. The price of Bitcoin fluctuates greatly. Now it has really grown significantly, primarily due to [Donald Trump’s election in the United States]. I would be cautious about this. I do not consider it necessary to create any stashes, especially in the Russian state budget.” Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the Russian State Duma’s Committee on the Financial Markets  Russia's economy struggles to find workers as defence sector poaches staff https://t.co/Yyou609mU2 pic.twitter.com/3ltxfwXZkJ— Reuters (@Reuters) November 28, 2024  Regardless, Russian crypto adoption is continuing apace. Whereas Moscow once considered enacting a China-style crackdown on crypto, the Kremlin has in recent months pivoted toward Bitcoin and other coins. US, UK, and EU-led sanctions are part of the reason for this. The government has launched a sandbox that uses crypto as a cross-border payment tool in international trade.  China’s support for Russia has hurt its relations with Europe, say Nordic and Baltic states https://t.co/n1aEbyv6eL— Financial Times (@FT) November 28, 2024  Mining Industry Growing However, another reason lies in the rapid growth of the Russian Bitcoin mining industry. In his interview, Aksakov repeated industry and government claims that crypto mining was likely to boost the Treasury’s coffers to the tune of around $555 million per year in tax revenue. Aksakov said:  “We have legalized cryptocurrencies so that they can be used for international settlements. And I know that many companies are already doing this. If it lets firms solve economic problems […] then let them use [crypto].” Aksakov Crypto Credit Cards Are Interesting, Askakov Explains The lawmaker also spoke favorably about “crypto credit cards,” which he said he had seen in operation in Asian nations.   UK pension scheme under fire for Bitcoin investment, sparking concerns about gambling with retirees' futures.#PensionFunds #Bitcoin https://t.co/7SYg8WGMQh— Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 28, 2024  He said he was “interested in the idea” of launching cards that let users pay in crypto, while merchants could receive rubles, instead of coins. In many nations, these cards are operated by crypto exchanges, which are yet to be regulated in Russia. The lawmaker said:  “I have even suggested implementing [crypto credit cards] in the framework of the sandbox. [But] the Central Bank regulates everything in that space. […] It is quite possible that a system like this would work. As such, our citizens will be able to use payment cards that are linked to a regular bank account, and to a distributed registry where cryptocurrencies are circulated.” Aksakov However, he quickly added that “currently, we are far from” using BTC in the Russian economic system.  “As things stand, I do not see – even in the distant future – a way for Bitcoin to become a popular currency that circulates domestically. Let me remind you that it is illegal to purchase goods and services in Russia using cryptocurrencies.” Aksakov Sanctions Sticking-points However, with US-EU-UK-Russia tensions only intensifying, Russian policymakers are continuing to explore the potential uses of crypto in sanctions evasion.  Russia targets Ukraine’s power system in a new air assault, the second large-scale barrage this month https://t.co/vlvnibkPIN— Bloomberg (@business) November 28, 2024  Aksakov concluded:  “Cryptocurrencies use a distributed registry, not the banking system. This also has certain advantages. It removes the risks associated with the supervision and control of the banking sector by countries unfriendly to Russia.”  The post Top Russian Lawmaker Rules Out Creating a National Bitcoin Reserve appeared first on Cryptonews.

Crypto News,Swiss Lawmakers to Study Bitcoin for Power Grid Upgrade,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/swiss-lawmakers-study-bitcoin-for-power-grid-upgrade/,"Swiss lawmakers in the Canton of Bern have approved a motion to study Bitcoin mining's potential to stabilize the energy grid and utilize surplus energy, aiming to enhance renewable energy systems and create job opportunities.The postSwiss Lawmakers to Study Bitcoin for Power Grid Upgradeappeared first onCryptonews."," In a groundbreaking decision, the Grand Council of Switzerland’s Canton of Bern has approved a motion to evaluate the potential of Bitcoin mining to stabilize the local energy grid and utilize surplus energy.  This legislative move was spearheaded by Swiss lawmaker Samuel Kullmann and supported by a cross-party group, “Parliamentary Group Bitcoin.”  The motion passed with an 85–46 majority despite resistance from the canton’s government council, which had previously dismissed the proposal, citing energy concerns and international implications.    With a clear verdict of 85 to 46 votes the parliament of @kanton_bern demands a report on the potential of #Bitcoin mining to stabilize our #energygrid and the use of otherwise wasted #energy.

The study will analyze the compatibility of Bitcoin mining with Bern’s energy policies and its potential role in job creation, grid stability, and environmental sustainability. Switzerland Lawmakers Approved Bitcoin Mining Motion: Could This Study Come Out Well? The motion, introduced in March 2024 by the Parliamentary Group Bitcoin—a coalition of 23 lawmakers from various political parties—called for a comprehensive study to identify opportunities for Bitcoin mining within the canton. The lawmakers drew inspiration from global examples, particularly the state of Texas in the U.S., where Bitcoin mining has been effectively integrated into energy policies.  Texas has demonstrated how mining operations can act as flexible electricity consumers, absorbing excess power during periods of overproduction and reducing consumption during shortages.   The motion emphasized that Bitcoin mining, often misunderstood as an energy-intensive activity, has evolved into one of the most sustainable and adaptable industries.  Bitcoin miners’ flexibility allows them to act as stabilizing agents in electricity markets.  This particular trait aligns with Switzerland’s goals of expanding renewable energy sources and improving grid reliability.  MASSIVE BREAKING: After speaking with a lawmaker in Switzerland, I can confirm he has officially passed legislation to study Bitcoin mining with a sweeping majority of votes.The study will focus on how Bitcoin mining can balance the grid and utilize wasted energy. pic.twitter.com/y6V2D3yXCY— Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) November 28, 2024  Government Opposition and Key Debates The Canton of Bern’s government council initially opposed the motion, arguing that Bitcoin mining’s energy consumption is primarily an international issue and does not significantly impact local energy production.  The council also cited concerns over competing demands for electricity from data centers, electric vehicles, and other sectors, which could strain Switzerland’s energy grid.   Additionally, the government council questioned the financial and regulatory implications of promoting Bitcoin mining.  They pointed out that Bitcoin is not legal tender and operates outside central banks’ control, raising issues related to price stability, money supply management, and potential criminal activity.  The council suggested that energy storage technologies, rather than Bitcoin mining, would be a more effective solution for managing overproduction and grid stability.   Despite these objections, the Grand Council’s overwhelming support for the motion reflects a shifting narrative around Bitcoin’s role in energy policy.  Lawmakers argued that ignoring Bitcoin’s potential could mean missing out on opportunities to attract investments, create jobs, and enhance energy efficiency.  Kullmann argued otherwise, that the study is not a commitment to adopting Bitcoin mining but a necessary step in evaluating its feasibility and benefits. If the study yields positive results, Bitcoin mining could become an integral part of Bern’s energy strategy, contributing to the canton’s goals of reducing energy wastage and stabilizing its electricity grid.  The initiative also has the potential to attract Bitcoin mining companies to Switzerland, boosting the local economy and fostering innovation in renewable energy integration.   This development aligns with broader trends in global Bitcoin adoption.  Countries like the United States and Brazil have proposed creating strategic Bitcoin reserves, while jurisdictions like Texas have demonstrated the practical benefits of integrating Bitcoin mining into energy policies.

This is more than 7X its all-time high (ATH) of $3.92, posted on November 17 this year. The bullish forecast was tweeted by “madness.sui” (X handle @lfgmadness). While their claim may be biased, several technical indicators potentially support their argument.  $SUI Price Prediction– Assuming it ranks 8th in market cap– Bitcoin reaches $150k:Low: $21.05Medium: $24.56High: $28.07$BTC $SOL $ETH @SuiNetwork @_StudioMirai pic.twitter.com/bexSxBEGjF— madness.sui  (@lfgmadness) November 28, 2024  Their prediction is based on two assumptions. Firstly, that Bitcoin will hit $150,000, and secondly, that $SUI will rise to become the eighth largest cryptocurrency by market cap. As of this writing, each $BTC is worth about $97,050 and there are 19,788,918 Bitcoins in circulation. When we multiply these two figures together, we arrive at Bitcoin’s market capitalization, which currently stands just north of $1.9 trillion.  So, assuming Bitcoin’s supply remains relatively level, which it has since this year’s “halving” update halved the issuance of new supply, then if Bitcoin’s price rises to $150,000 within a year, its market cap would be just north of $3 trillion. Source: Statista Various analysts this year have predicted Bitcoin’s price could rise to $150k next year, including brokerage firm Bernstein, independent analyst Elja and prominent commodity trader Peter Brandt.  Given Bitcoin’s historical tendency to enter a bull run after every halving, this year’s halving could easily spur on the requisite level of growth.  So, assuming this year’s supply halving rallies the price into a bull run, let’s take Brandt’s estimate of Bitcoin reaching $150k by August 2025 to see where Sui Network could reach. According to the chart below, by August 2025, Sui Network will have a circulating supply of ballpark 3.5 billion.  Source: TradingView So, where’s SUI Heading Next? Like Solana and Ethereum, Sui Network deploys high-functionality smart contracts, enabling developers to build a world of decentralized applications (dApps) offering services from finance to gaming. While Ethereum has a maximum theoretical throughput of 119 transactions per second (tps), Sui’s developers say it is capable of achieving a staggering 297,000, thanks to its ability to process multiple transactions simultaneously. These fundamentals have made Sui a potential “Ethereum killer”. But to reach a high of $28, the token would need to 7X. Given the fact that it achieved 4X in the space of just over three months (between September 12 and November 18), a market-wide post-halving bull run could easily bootstrap it to $28 by August next year.  Should that happen, Sui will have a market cap of $98 billion. Remember, the circulating supply at this point will be 3.5 billion $SUI. So, multiply that by $28 to arrive at $98 billion, a figure which would make $SUI the fifth largest coin in the world today, just one place behind the $114 billion cap Solana.  It’s also worth noting that the market cap of meme coins on Sui Network blew up by 30% in the space of 24 hours just yesterday. This pivot to meme coins could provide Sui’s blockchain with a driving narrative next year, much like Solana’s meme coin launchpad Pump.fun did this year.  In conclusion, Sui could reach $28 if Bitcoin hits $150k. It is a perfectly grounded and believable prediction, but a lot changes very fast in crypto and the market is volatile, so all estimates, no matter how technical, are educated guesses.  Additionally, after frequent rallies, Sui’s price has moved double the distance Bitcoin’s this month. Bitcoin rose 34.5%, while Sui rose 68.9%, making $SUI one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy in November. While Sui and Bitcoin Rally to New Highs, Catslap Explodes onto the Scene While Sui and Bitcoin have been setting new high watermarks, over in the weird and wonderful world of meme coins, one new project has its sights on becoming the biggest cat meme coin in the world.

The coin is still down by 2.5% in the past week, but remains up by 9% in a fortnight and 33% in a month, with its medium-term momentum still strong as it tries to climb higher. Recent analysis has shown that BTC was always likely to hit strong resistance at the $100,000 level, given that this price aligns with a long-term Fibonacci channel that has rejected earlier highs in 2013, 2019 and May 2024. But these same Fibonacci channels suggest that the Bitcoin price could even top $200,000 by the middle of next year, assuming continuity with historical data. Analyst Reveals Bitcoin Fibonacci Channel Resistance Levels and BTC Price Target Over $100k Posting on TradingView, the TradingShot account observed that Bitcoin hit its first “real resistance” of the current bull cycle when it neared $100,000 last Friday. Source: TradingView/TradingShot There are a couple of key things to take from the above chart, which displays Bitcoin’s price since 2013 and sets it against seven Fibonacci channels. The first is that the current bull cycle hasn’t hit its absolute peak, which would be somewhere close to the 0 Fibonacci channel (the one at the top). The second is that it shows how previous bull cycles – long-term moves from a bottom to a top – had lasted around 1,050 days, which implies a peak at some point in September or October of 2025. The 50-period (blue) and 200-period (orange) moving averages on the chart also support the claim that the current bull market still has plenty of time left to run, given that the 50-period climbed over its longer term counterpart only in August. And looking at the fundamental picture, it’s likely that the inauguration of Donald Trump in January will result in the steady flow of very positive news for Bitcoin and crypto.

As for the near term, its one-hour chart shows it on an upwards trajectory, implying that it could make further gains over the weekend. Its RSI (purple) is rising towards 70 in a sign of growing buying pressure, while its 30-period average (orange) overtook the 200-period (blue) only a few days ago.

What’s also bullish that, because of the platform’s scalability, it will provide double the staking rewards it would have as a layer-one coin. This will provide a greater incentive to hold PEPU, as will the fact that users will need the coin to pay for the layer-two’s transaction fees. It seems that many investors are already sold on Pepe Unchained’s plans, with the project’s official X account boasting over 65,000 followers. Read More: Pepe Unchained Price Prediction    This gives a strong indication of how big PEPU could bee once it launches, with investors still able to join its sale by visiting the coin’s official website. The sale will end in 14 days, with the coin now at its final sale price of $0.01295. Based on its early success, it could rise much higher than this once it lists in the just over a fortnight.

Crypto News,XRP Jumps 8% as Bitcoin Recovers to $96K Amid Broader Market Uptick ,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-jumps-8-amid-broader-market-uptick/,"XRP token soared more than 8% in the last 24 hours, outperforming major altcoins as the market saw a slight broader uptick.The postXRP Jumps 8% as Bitcoin Recovers to $96K Amid Broader Market Uptickappeared first onCryptonews."," XRP token surged over 8% in the last 24 hours, trading at $1.67, outperforming Bitcoin and other major altcoins. The leading cryptocurrency also settled above $96,000 after a correction to $91,000 earlier this week.  Meanwhile, Ether (ETH), Solana’s SOL, and BNB showed minimal movement, while Cardano’s ADA rose by 3.5%, and Dogecoin (DOGE) slipped 1.2%. Alogrand (ALGO) and Worldcoin (WLD) rose more than 15% in the last 24 hours, as per Coingecko data.  Source: CoinGecko  XRP Sees Renewed Optimism XRP has been witnessing renewed optimism since Donald Trump’s victory in the US elections. The US SEC chair Gary Gensler, who led the charge against Ripple, is set to leave office, boosting the community’s hope. The lawsuit against Ripple could finally come to an end with the US SEC set to be led by a more pro-crypto chairman under Trump’s presidency.  Global asset manager WisdomTree, with over $113 billion in assets under management (AUM), registered an XRP ETF in Delaware on Monday. Following the registration, the asset manager is expected to file an S-1 with the US SEC, giving a boost to the XRP price this week.As reported earlier, Ripple announced the rollout of a tokenized money market fund on the XRP Ledger in collaboration with UK digital asset exchange Archax and asset manager Abrdn plc. XRP Ledger meme coins have also become increasingly popular, due to the blockchain’s low fees, scalability, speed, and environmentally friendly infrastructure. Bitcoin $100K Rally Stalls After Traders Lock-In Profits  Bitcoin faced some profit-taking last week after falling short of the much-anticipated $100,000 mark. However, losses were tempered by optimism surrounding Trump’s key regulatory appointments, which signal a potentially more industry-friendly approach.  As reported earlier, Trump could potentially move the regulatory oversight of crypto from the SEC to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Trump also announced to nominate pro crypto hedge fund executive Scott Bessent as his Treasury Secretary.

Bitcoin was last trading just under $97,000, a solid recovery from Tuesday’s dip back below $91,000.  10x Research founder and CEO Markus Thielen is optimistic that a breakout above $100,000 will likely occur in the near future, he told members of the crypto press earlier this week.  Bitcoin came within a few hundred dollars of hitting $100,000 last week, and Thielen noted that the recent pullback has helped to “alleviate its overbought technical condition”.  Weakness towards the end of the month is also normal for BTC, Thielen said. He also warned that a surprise decision by the US Federal Reserve to hold rates steady in December could be a short-term headwind.  However, “despite these short-term headwinds, we remain confident that Bitcoin will surpass the $100,000 milestone within the coming weeks, maintaining a bullish outlook for 2025”, Thielen concluded.   How High Can Bitcoin Go as New Crypto Golden Age Beckons? Since President-elect Trump’s November election victory, Bitcoin has been riding a wave of optimism surrounding the likelihood of accelerated global adoption in the coming years under a pro-crypto Trump administration.  Trump has promised to establish a national bitcoin stockpile and to never sell the US government’s BTC holdings.Polymarket’s betting market are also currently pricing a 29% chance that Trump goes a step further and establishes a national Bitcoin reserve in his first 90 days.

Senator Cynthia Lummis recently put forward a bill saying the US government should sell gold to fund the purchase of 1 million BTC, while Trump ally and Healthy Secretary pick RFK Junior has advocated for buying up to 4 million BTC.  Meanwhile, a pro-crypto Republican controlled Congress is expected to pass pro-Bitcoin/crypto legislation in the coming session.   US #Bitcoin Reserve of 4,000,000 $BTC Unreal  pic.twitter.com/YIbbla1cLC— Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) July 26, 2024  It’s no wonder then that at the dawn of a new golden age for crypto in the USA (and globally), Bitcoin continues to test $100,000. And if the US actually started buying BTC, this would presumably kickstart a global race to accumulate the asset.  That could fast-track Bitcoin’s market cap towards that of gold, last around $17 trillion. Given Bitcoin’s current market cap around $1.9 trillion, that could mean gains of 10x are still possible in this scenario.  Of course, that would still likely take many years and there would be many major drawdown events.  Bitcoin Investment Strategy to Consider Assuming Bitcoin is on the fast track to supplant gold as the world’s most important reserve asset in the decades ahead, investors with a long-term vision ought to get started accumulating as much as possible as soon as possible.  One strategy to consider is “dollar cost averaging” (DCAing). This is where investors allocate a set amount of their monthly savings to Bitcoin every week/month, regardless of its price.  They continue to buy regardless of market conditions and aim to hold indefinitely, but at least for 8 years.  Over time, they should secure a very favorable average price as they buy both market peaks and troughs.    This is one of the most conservative investment strategies in crypto. Riskier strategies include investing in alt-coins and meme coins, which are more volatile than BTC.  Whilst DCAing into BTC over the next 8 years is highly likely to bring strong returns, traders may be able to make the same returns over a very short time period in the coming months should alt-season really get going.  Of course, they should bear in mind that they run a much higher risk of losing everything.  One of the alt-coin sectors that is most likely to deliver strong gains is meme coins – indeed, these have led the gains in crypto in 2024.  Established meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE) and Brett (BRETT) could easily deliver 10x gains.  But newer, lesser-known meme coins with smaller market caps could deliver even bigger gains, potentially of as much as 100x.  One new meme coin that analysts at cryptonews.com have been watching and think has massive potential is Pepe Unchained (PEPU).  Pepe Unchained, set to launch in just 15 days, has raised a whopping more than $60 million so far in its presale, one of the biggest raises so far this year of any crypto project.  Investors have been piling money into the new meme coin because Pepe Unchained is way more than just your average meme token.  Pepe Unchained is a layer-2 Ethereum scaling blockchain that has been busily building out entire meme-focused trading and DeFi ecosystem.

These funds, which allow investors to invest in Bitcoin (BTC) without actually holding the digital currency, have attracted a record $6.2 billion in new inflows this month (as of Nov. 27). This surpasses the previous record set in February when inflows reached $6 billion.  Spot btc ETFs set to break monthly inflow record… $6.2bil so far in November. Previous high was $6bil in February. via @markets pic.twitter.com/u8WvDHwoSM — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) November 29, 2024  BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continues to lead the pack, with net inflows of 5.4 billion in November and year-to-date inflows of 31.6 billion.  On Nov. 11, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of $1.11 billion. This was followed by another surge on Nov. 21, with $1 billion flowing into these funds, according to SoSoValue data. Total Bitcoin ETF net inflows (Nov. 1 – Nov. 27). Source: SoSoValue Trump Promises Pro-Crypto Agenda The surge in investments in Bitcoin ETFs is being fueled by Bitcoin’s rise toward the $100,000 mark, driven in part by President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. Bitcoin briefly flirted with the $100,000 milestone last week, propelled by Trump’ promises to dismantle existing crypto regulations and foster a more favorable environment for digital assets.  The incoming president pledged to make the United States the crypto capital of the world, create a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” and establish a crypto advisory council tasked with designing transparent regulatory guidance to benefit the digital asset industry. Bitcoin’s Stellar YTD Performance Outshines Traditional Assets While Bitcoin’s rally has cooled slightly this week, currently settling around $97,300, its year-to-date performance (+151.5%) remains stellar, outshining traditional assets like stocks and gold. The surge follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s reluctant approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January after a court ruling.  With the departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a known crypto critic, on Jan 20, the path is cleared for a more crypto-friendly successor and potentially a wave of new ETFs for other digital tokens.

In total, MicroStrategy now owns over $38 billion in bitcoin.Other companies are now starting to copy the Microstrategy play book and run their strategy of accumulating bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Saylor even presented to Microsoft’s CEO and board of directors on why they should adopt a bitcoin standard. Microsoft is the third largest company in the world by market cap, and is voting on whether or not they should add bitcoin to their balance sheet. Insane!Publicly traded bitcoin miner MARA is also copying MicroStrategy’s playbook and announced today that they’re raising up to $805 million in debt to buy more bitcoin.Do you get it yet?This is not going to stop any time soon. We have officially entered a new era of bitcoin accumulation that is being led by these large corporations. Saylor, MicroStrategy, and other companies are going to scoop up every available coin they can get their hands on. And if they’re as convicted as MicroStrategy is — they’re not selling. That’s not even to mention the other big players now (BlackRock, Fidelity, ARK, etc) buying up coins for their ETFs. The amount of demand for bitcoin today is surreal.

I’m not saying or advising anyone to take on debt to buy bitcoin, but rather adopt it as your primary savings account and sit back and take in all the benefits of holding bitcoin — especially in regards to holding your own private keys.The plan is simple: buy bitcoin, secure it safely, and hold it for the long term. If you sell, you will be selling directly into the hands of MicroStrategy and every other company running this playbook. This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Debanked: The Financial Suppression of Bitcoin Businesses Must End,"Mon, 02 Dec 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/debanked-the-financial-suppression-of-bitcoin-businesses-must-end,Why regulators must be held accountable for the consequences of Operation Chokepoint 2.0.,"We can't live in a world where somebody starts a company that's a completely legal thing, and then they literally [] get sanctioned [] and embargoed by the United States government through a completely unaccountable [process] by the way. No due process. None of this is written down. There's no rules. There's no court, there's no decision process. There's no appeal. Who do you appeal to, right? [] Who do you go to to get your bank account back? — Marc Andreessen, speaking to Joe Rogan, published on 11/26/2024In yet another troubling manifestation of ""Chokepoint 2.0,"" a Wyoming company was summarily debanked in early November, 2024, by Mercury, a banking platform operated with Evolve Bank (and other banking partners). After years of seamless operations and exemplary service, Mercury abruptly terminated the account without clear cause. The excuse? A vague nod to ""internal factors"" that remain as opaque as the regulatory pressures likely behind them.Let’s be clear: The company's banking activity was uncontroversial. The only potential offense is that the company accepts a sizable portion of its customer payments in Bitcoin. Aside from monthly wires from Kraken (a regulated crypto exchange), its transactions included rent, utility payments, hardware store purchases, and subcontractor invoices.The termination couldn't have had anything to do with risky behavior or financial misconduct. Instead, the closure is emblematic of a systemic effort to hobble Bitcoin businesses by exploiting the centralized banking choke points regulators have turned into tools of suppression.This is Chokepoint 2.0 in action. Regulators have found new ways to suppress industries they disfavor—this time, targeting Bitcoin miners and businesses. Instead of legislative debate or due process, unelected bureaucrats leverage their oversight of banks to nudge them into “de-risking” clients that engage in entirely legal activities. The company was simply collateral damage in the campaign to isolate Bitcoin from the traditional financial system.This is a chilling echo of Operation Chokepoint 1.0, where federal regulators illegally pressured banks to cut off services to lawful but disfavored industries, such as firearms dealers and payday lenders. That campaign ended in disgrace when the FDIC was forced to settle a lawsuit in 2019. The settlement affirmed what should have been obvious: weaponizing the financial system against legal businesses is unconstitutional. Regulators know this—and yet here we are again.Why This MattersDebanking isn’t just an inconvenience. For businesses, it’s existential. Operating without a reliable banking partner in today's economy is like trying to breathe without air. When banks are coerced into severing ties with Bitcoin-related companies, it sends a chilling message: engage in this industry at your peril. It also stifles innovation, a dangerous precedent for a country founded on economic freedom.Moreover, this practice undermines the core tenet of fairness in financial services. The American banking system isn’t a private fiefdom. It operates under public charters and with public trust, and its gatekeepers should not act as arbiters of political or ideological purity.The harm extends beyond Bitcoin. If regulators can throttle this industry, what stops them from targeting others? What happens when innovation, dissent, or inconvenient truths are deemed “too risky” for the comfort of entrenched powers? This is about more than Bitcoin—it’s about the integrity of the financial system and the preservation of free markets.A Call to Action: Accountability for RegulatorsThe new Congress and Trump administration must seize this moment to hold the architects of Chokepoint 2.0 accountable. This isn’t a partisan issue; it’s a constitutional one. Regulators acting as de facto lawmakers, imposing policies that would never survive public scrutiny, must be reigned in.Investigations into Regulatory Overreach Congress must launch comprehensive investigations into the agencies pressuring banks to sever ties with Bitcoin businesses. Who issued these directives? Under what authority? The American people deserve answers, and the offending parties deserve consequences.Personal Accountability for RegulatorsBureaucrats who abuse their power should not be shielded by the anonymity of the regulatory machine. Those responsible for weaponizing the financial system against lawful businesses must be named, shamed, and removed from their positions, permanently lose any security clearances they may have, and potentially lose their government pensions and retirement benefits.Restoration of Due ProcessAny decisions to restrict banking access should require clear, codified standards and a transparent appeals process. No more shadow rules. If a business is to be debanked, the reasons should be public, defensible, clearly articulated & defined, grounded in law, and appealable.Legislation to Protect Financial AccessCongress should pass laws prohibiting banks from discriminating against lawful industries based on political or ideological reasons. The free market thrives on neutrality; it withers under bias.Decentralization of Financial SystemsBitcoin exists as a hedge against precisely this kind of overreach. Policymakers should embrace and encourage its growth, not fight it. America cannot afford to fall behind in the global race for financial innovation.Much of the above could be addressed through Section 10 of the SAFER Banking Act, which directly limits undue regulatory influence over banking services. Specifically, it prohibits federal banking agencies from pressuring financial institutions to terminate relationships with lawful businesses, including those in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency industry, based on reputational risks or political motivations. This provision reinforces the principle that decisions about financial services should rely on risk-based analysis of individual accounts rather than blanket biases against entire industries. By codifying such protections, the SAFER Banking Act would promote fairness and transparency in financial services, ensuring that regulators adhere to their duties of impartial oversight while respecting the rights of businesses operating legally under state or federal law.In addition to legislative solutions, the presence of even one bank with the willingness and capability to resist undue regulatory pressure could dramatically reshape the financial landscape for Bitcoin businesses. Caitlin Long’s Custodia Bank, based in Wyoming, exemplifies this potential. Custodia has consistently demonstrated its commitment to operating within the law while challenging the overreach of federal regulators, as seen in its lawsuit against the Federal Reserve.A bank with this level of resolve, direct access to the Federal Reserve itself, and a proven track record of standing up to regulators will provide a lifeline for Bitcoin (and other) businesses seeking reliable financial services. By fostering an ecosystem where lawful businesses can thrive without fear of arbitrary debanking, Custodia Bank offers a template for how other institutions might follow suit, ensuring that innovation and economic freedom remain protected.1Taken together, the SAFER Banking Act and the perseverance of institutions like Custodia Bank represent two critical fronts in the fight against financial discrimination. While the SAFER Act provides a legislative framework to curtail regulatory overreach and protect lawful businesses from debanking, it has faced significant resistance, having been introduced multiple times in Congress only to be repeatedly blocked. Meanwhile, Custodia Bank's struggle underscores the severity of institutional hostility; the Federal Reserve's refusal to grant Custodia access to the banking system forced the bank to file a federal lawsuit just to claim its rightful place in the financial ecosystem. These challenges highlight the entrenched opposition to reform, but they also emphasize the urgent need for a multi-pronged strategy—legislative, judicial, and entrepreneurial—to ensure fair and impartial access to banking services for all lawful businesses.Bitcoiners: The Frontline of FreedomBitcoin isn’t just money; it’s an idea—an idea that money and power belong to the people, not the state. This is why we’re here. This is why Bitcoin exists. The legacy financial system is crumbling under its own corruption, and every act of suppression only underscores the need for decentralized alternatives.To be clear, I don't fully blame Mercury and Evolve for this. They're likely being forced into it by their regulators.2 Indeed, due to the Orwellian Bank Secrecy Act, the banks aren't allowed to disclose the reasons for these matters to the affected customers. Banks like Mercury, and any others who have willingly cooperated with Chokepoint 2.0 should be subject to Congressional Subpoenas to explain themselves, and also name-and-shame the regulators who coopted them.The future of Bitcoin—and America’s role as a leader in innovation—depends on exposing and dismantling Chokepoint 2.0, and holding all those who participated in it accountable.1 Of course, Custodia Bank having a master account doesn’t eliminate the possibility of governmental censorship, but it does force it to be direct and open, rather than the indirect, hidden, and unappealable route the regulators can take now. See this x-post by Caitlin Long.2 Another reason to believe that, in the case of Mercury and Evolve, the regulators are responsible, is that Evolve Bank was penalized in June 2024 by the Federal Reserve, and likely forced into these actions by their overreaching and overreactive regulators as part of that penalty.This is a guest post by Colin Crossman.

Despite a sharp 8.64% intra-week pullback over the past few days, Bitcoin’s price surged to a record monthly close of $96,506 by the end of November. The recovery came after Bitcoin dipped to $90,911 on Nov. 26, the largest decline since a pre-election sell-off in October. Despite the brief pullback, November saw Bitcoin gain 37.3%, the second-best monthly performance of the year. Bitcoin’s strong momentum heading into December is seen as a positive signal. The report forecasted a continuation of the upward trend, particularly given BTC’s historical performance during halving years.  In the past, halving years have seen exceptional price growth, with Bitcoin typically seeing an average increase of 38.86%. However, the report also suggests that December may see heightened volatility, especially as it coincides with the most significant options expiry of the year. Additionally, recent Bitcoin supply and demand trends suggest that the market could experience a temporary pullback before reaching new highs. Supply trends While the medium-term outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish, concerns about a short-term pullback persist. The report highlighted the sustained distribution of Bitcoin from long-term holders (LTHs) as a critical factor influencing price conditions.  Over the past two weeks, LTHs have capitalized on the increased demand by resuming large-scale distribution of their holdings. Since the peak in LTH supply in September, approximately 508,990 BTC has been distributed. This distribution level, while substantial, is still smaller than the 934,000 BTC sold during the rally leading to the March high of $73,666. Yet, it remains a critical factor in the short-term outlook.  If the demand from short-term holders (STHs) and marginal buyers does not match the supply being offloaded by LTHs, Bitcoin could experience further price volatility and a deeper pullback before continuing its ascent. STH supply is nearing its cycle high of 3,282,000 BTC, with just over 3.25 million BTC held by short-term buyers. Historically, the final leg of Bitcoin’s bull market is triggered when STH supply surpasses pre-halving cycle highs.  If STH demand can meet or exceed the supply from LTHs, Bitcoin could see continued upward momentum. The Long-Term Holder SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio), which tracks the profit margin at which LTHs sell their Bitcoin, currently sits at 2.6.  Notably, market tops have occurred when the SOPR is above 3, indicating a more significant profit-taking phase. The current level suggests that while LTHs are still selling, they have yet to reach the peak of their distribution, leaving room for further upward movement if STH demand remains strong. Outlook for December If the market can absorb the supply from LTHs, the path to $100,000 becomes increasingly likely. The report noted that while typically volatile, Bitcoin’s performance in December could remain neutral to positive due to the strong momentum from November, combined with the halving-year effects that often boost Bitcoin’s price. However, the volatility expected in the latter part of the month — due to options expiring and the potential for profit-taking — could create short-term price fluctuations.  The report cautioned that traders and investors must remain vigilant in the coming weeks, monitoring both the supply trends and the demand from short-term holders to gauge Bitcoin’s next move. With LTHs continuing to distribute, the key scenario for Bitcoin in the short term is whether enough new demand can enter the market to support the continued upward momentum. If the balance tips favor short-term holders, the $100,000 threshold may not be far off — but until then, volatility will likely remain a fixture in Bitcoin’s price action.

In a Dec. 2 statement, the company revealed that its BTC production rose by 26% month-over-month to 907 BTC. Additionally, its energized hash rate surged 15% to reach 46.1 EH/s, marking significant growth since October. The miner also reported the highest number of blocks mined in a single month, 254 blocks—an increase of 27% from October. Marathon’s CEO Fred Thiel attributed these results to the successful deployment of new miners and improvements in operational efficiency. He emphasized that these achievements underscore the company’s leadership in the industry. Bitcoin acquisitions In a separate announcement, Marathon Digital disclosed plans to raise $700 million through a private offering of unsecured convertible senior notes due 2031. The company explained that the notes would be converted into cash, MARA stock, or a combination of both. It added that it plans to allocate up to $50 million of the proceeds to repurchase part of its existing 2026 convertible notes, with the remainder directed toward acquiring more Bitcoin and supporting general corporate activities. This follows Marathon’s $1 billion fundraising through a similar offering in mid-November, which enabled the purchase of 6,474 BTC, valued at approximately $615 million. Thiel said that Marathon’s dual mining and acquiring Bitcoin strategy provides significant flexibility, allowing the company to capitalize on favorable market conditions. He added that this approach optimizes acquisition costs by buying during price declines and strengthens Marathon’s competitive edge by mining BTC at lower costs than the prevailing spot price. As of Nov. 30, Marathon had acquired 12,965 BTC year-to-date at an average price of $77,692. In total, the company has mined 8,563 BTC, bringing its year-to-date BTC yield per share to 37.2%. Overall, the company holds 34,959 BTC, valued at $3.3 billion. According to Bitcoin Treasuries data, Marathon is the second-largest public Bitcoin holder, behind only MicroStrategy.

MicroStrategy purchased 15,400 BTC for approximately $1.5 billion in cash, according to a Form 8-K, which public companies use to announce unexpected material events or corporate changes, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Dec. 2.  The business intelligence company paid an average price of $95,976 per Bitcoin, including fees and expenses.  This purchase brings MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin return to 38.7% for the quarter and 63.3% year-to-date.

Between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1, MicroStrategy sold approximately 3.7 million shares, generating net proceeds of around $1.48 billion after deducting sales commissions. This sale is part of a broader plan under the sales agreement with various financial institutions, which allows for the issuance and sale of up to $21 billion worth of shares.  As of Dec. 1, MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings stand at 402,100 BTC, acquired at an aggregate purchase price of roughly $23.4 Billion. This equates to an average price of $58,263 per Bitcoin, including associated fees and costs. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings and share dilution. Source: MicroStrategy The sales agreement, initiated on Oct. 30 with TD Securities (USA) LLC and other sales agents, has facilitated the sale of shares, leaving the company with approximately $11.3 billion worth of shares available for future transactions. 2025 Will Become the “Year of the Crypto Renaissance” MicroStrategy continues to actively accumulate Bitcoin. To fund these purchases, the company is strategically issuing shares to expand its cryptocurrency holdings.  This strategy aligns with CEO Michael Saylor’s vocal support for Bitcoin, further solidifying MicroStrategy’s position as a leading institutional holder of the cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy calls Bitcoin as “the highest performing uncorrelated asset that a corporation can hold on its balance sheet” in its recent presentation about the company’s Bitcoin strategy.  In the presentation, MicroStrategy predicts that 2025 will be the “year of the crypto renaissance.” This prediction is based on anticipated developments such as Wall Street’s embrace of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), widespread adoption of fair value accounting for digital assets, and a pro-Bitcoin stance from the next U.S. president and cabinet.  Further supporting this “renaissance” are MicroStrategy’s expectations of growing congressional support for crypto, the establishment of a “Bitcoin Strategic Reserve”, and a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in the U.S. MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) is closely tied to Bitcoin’s performance, but with amplified swings. While Bitcoin is up 150% this year, MSTR has surged by 513%. This heightened volatility was clear in November when MSTR soared 58%, exceeding Bitcoin’s 37% gain for the month.  $MSTR November 2024 Returns: +58.47% December will be very interesting to see how we close out this amazing quarter and year.

A growing number of companies are adding the cryptocurrency to their balance sheets as a potential hedge against inflation. Artificial intelligence firm Genius Group also joined the trend on Nov. 18, purchasing 110 Bitcoin for $10 million and outlining its intention to hold up to 90% of its reserves in Bitcoin in the future.  Additionally, tech solution provider Semler Scientific increased its Bitcoin holdings to 1,570 BTC by purchasing 297 coins for $29.1 million between Nov. 18 and 22 at an average price of $75,039 per coin. Adding to this trend, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet plans to raise over $62 million through a stock acquisition plan to buy more Bitcoin, adding to its current holdings of 1,142 Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Magazine,Why Trump Must End Capital Gains Tax On Bitcoin,"Sat, 07 Dec 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/why-trump-must-end-capital-gains-tax-on-bitcoin,"By eliminating capital gains taxes on Bitcoin, the Trump administration can spur U.S. innovation, strengthen the nation’s economic sovereignty, and ensure everyday Americans gain equal footing in the world’s rapidly evolving digital economy.","In a world where digital assets are quickly becoming a cornerstone of global finance, the United States stands at a crossroads. The Trump administration has repeatedly emphasized its dedication to making everyday Americans more prosperous. From pledging to restore economic strength on the campaign trail to appointing forward-thinking advisors, the White House seems poised to usher in a new era of financial freedom. But if President Trump truly wants to supercharge wealth creation for average citizens—and establish the U.S. as the world’s leading “Bitcoin Superpower”—his administration must embrace a bold, transformative policy: eliminate capital gains taxes on Bitcoin.  This global map shows how various countries tax (or don’t tax) Bitcoin after one year. Many green jurisdictions, including those in parts of Europe, the Caribbean, and Asia, have chosen to exempt long-term Bitcoin holdings from capital gains tax.  The Winds of Change: Lessons from AbroadThe Czech Republic recently made headlines when its Parliament overwhelmingly voted to exempt capital gains from Bitcoin and other crypto-asset sales from personal income tax—provided they’re held for more than three years and meet certain income thresholds. This is not an isolated event. Countries like Switzerland, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, El Salvador, Hong Kong, and parts of the Caribbean have long recognized that zero or minimal capital gains taxation on Bitcoin can help spur adoption, financial innovation, and consumer confidence.As John F. Kennedy famously said, “A rising tide lifts all boats.” If we apply that logic to economic growth through Bitcoin, the tide is global—and it’s rising fast. In a sea awash with global liquidity and debt, America’s economic ship must navigate these digital currents. These nations’ policy choices—and their citizens’ increasing prosperity—send a powerful signal: The U.S. can and should leverage Bitcoin as a tool for growth, not burden it with outdated taxation models.Trump’s Own Words: A Path to ProsperityPresident Trump himself has indicated a willingness to rethink Bitcoin taxation. “They have them paying tax on crypto, and I don’t think that’s right,” he said in a recent interview, echoing the frustrations of millions of Americans who find it absurd to pay capital gains taxes after using Bitcoin to purchase something as small as a cup of coffee. “Bitcoin is money, and you have to pay capital gains tax if you use it to buy a coffee?” he asked rhetorically, highlighting how current laws discourage everyday transactions. He added, “Maybe we get rid of taxes on crypto and replace it with tariffs.”This sentiment isn’t just rhetorical flourish. Trump, who spoke at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville, proclaimed his vision for America to become the world’s “Bitcoin Superpower.” He’s also pledged to “Make Bitcoin in America,” turning the U.S. into a leading hub of Bitcoin innovation. Moreover, he appointed former PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as his 'White House A.I. & Crypto Czar' on December 5—a move widely seen as a step toward implementing forward-looking crypto policies.The BITCOIN Act of 2024: A Strategic Reserve for the PeopleThe U.S. has already taken monumental steps in this direction. The BITCOIN Act of 2024 mandates that all Bitcoin held by any federal agency be transferred to the Treasury to be held in a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Over five years, the Treasury must purchase one million Bitcoins, holding them in trust for the United States. This government-level accumulation shows a long-term vision for incorporating Bitcoin into national financial strategy. But why stop there? Eliminating capital gains tax on Bitcoin would create a positive feedback loop between national policy and personal prosperity. As the federal government invests and holds Bitcoin, private citizens could do the same without facing punitive tax obligations.Serving the Everyday AmericanFor everyday Americans, the cost of living and the sting of inflation were focal points of President Trump’s reelection campaign. Traditional strategies—interest rate manipulations, quantitative easing—often amount to rearranging deck chairs on a sinking ship when confronted with truly systemic economic challenges. Bitcoin offers a life raft—dare we say, a digital Noah’s Ark—for Americans trying to preserve and grow their wealth against the erosive forces of inflation. Removing capital gains taxes on Bitcoin would allow citizens to transact, invest, and save in a stable, finite asset without the drain of federal taxes on every incremental gain.The ripple effect here is clear: More people adopting Bitcoin as a store of value and medium of exchange means stronger demand, which could further buttress the U.S. Treasury’s strategic holdings. It’s a virtuous cycle, a positive feedback loop. As Bitcoin’s value grows, so does the nation’s wealth base—helping pay down national debt, bolstering the dollar’s hegemony in global trade, and genuinely making Americans richer and more secure.Why America Needs BitcoinBitcoin is no longer a niche experiment reserved for a small band of enthusiasts. It has evolved into a mainstream, urgent priority for everyday Americans—especially the rising generation that will shape our nation’s future economy. This is not some ideological plea; it’s a practical, data-backed reality. According to the Stand With Crypto Alliance, a non-profit dedicated to transparent blockchain policies, more than 52 million Americans now own some form of cryptocurrency. Nearly nine in ten Americans believe the financial system needs updating, and 45% say they would not support candidates who stand in the way of crypto innovation. These numbers represent a sweeping, cross-partisan groundswell: Stand With Crypto’s research shows that 18% of Republicans, 22% of Democrats, and 22% of Independents hold crypto. This cuts through the usual tribal politics and points to a fundamental truth—Bitcoin is now a national policy talking point, not a side note on a fringe agenda.The demand for America to lead is clear. 53% of Americans want crypto companies to be U.S.-based, ensuring that technological innovation and the wealth it generates remain on home soil. Among Fortune 500 executives, 73% prefer U.S.-based partners for their crypto and Web3 initiatives, signaling a corporate desire to keep America at the forefront of global financial progress.Failing to act now risks a replay of past mistakes. America once led the world in advanced manufacturing, yet today 92% of the most sophisticated semiconductor production sits in Taiwan and South Korea. We cannot afford to cede the future financial landscape to other regions. Bitcoin isn’t just another investment class; it is the digital backbone of a rapidly evolving monetary system. If the U.S. wants to preserve its economic hegemony, maintain innovation leadership, and ensure everyday Americans have access to a stable, growth-oriented financial future, it must embrace Bitcoin wholeheartedly. In doing so, the nation can secure its place as the global Bitcoin superpower—uplifting our citizens, strengthening our economic base, and safeguarding our strategic interests in the 21st-century digital economy.America, Charting the CourseBy aligning with global best practices and enacting forward-thinking policies, the U.S. can position itself as a beacon of financial liberty and technical innovation. Eliminating capital gains tax on Bitcoin would signal to investors, entrepreneurs, and everyday citizens that America is serious about leading in the 21st century’s digital economy. It’s not just about being “Bitcoin-friendly”; it’s about ensuring that average Americans have the tools they need to navigate turbulent economic waters.The complexity and inefficiency of taxing every digital transaction is an unnecessary burden on innovation and everyday life. Americans deserve better—they deserve the freedom to transact in a digital world without punitive oversight.In essence, this is America’s chance to do what it has always done best: innovate, adapt, and lead. Removing capital gains taxes on Bitcoin wouldn’t just fulfill a campaign promise; it would set the stage for long-term prosperity, empower citizens to secure their financial futures, and cement the United States as the world’s foremost Bitcoin champion. A rising tide, indeed, lifts all boats—and what better vessel to embark upon than a Bitcoin Ark, captained by a visionary administration determined to truly Make America Great Again?

Bitcoin Magazine,The Joule Paradox: Energy sets the value of bitcoin and bitcoin sets the value of energy,"Fri, 06 Dec 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-joule-paradox-energy-sets-the-value-of-bitcoin-and-bitcoin-sets-the-value-of-energy,"Energy is the fundamental, base commodity upon which everything of value is produced and bitcoin is the most pure embodiment of energy in a monetary form.","Early in our thinking about the interaction between bitcoin and energy it became obvious to me that the value of bitcoin was fundamentally underpinned by the amount of energy that went into producing the bitcoin. As with any free market system, the value of a widget (in this case bitcoin) is determined by the cost of producing the widget plus the various levels of profit margin needed to get from manufacturing to the consumer. If someone has an innovative ability to supply something that no one else can and there is a large demand for this product then they have the ability to extract more profit based upon the scarcity of the supply relative to the demand. If the innovation is not sufficiently proprietary then others will recognise this arbitrage opportunity and seek to satisfy some or all of the demand. Over some period of time, we expect the ecosystem of producers to compete with each other for demand until a point is reached where the price of the product reflects the minimally acceptable level of profit margin for all participants in the production, supply, and sales chain. Additional innovations in production technique, material sourcing, or labour costs may give a temporary advantage to one producer over others and they can enjoy a period of greater profitability – that is until the other producers implement similar advantages and the overall price for the product gets driven lower. This is what Adam Smith called the invisible hand or more modern economic thinkers call the economic equilibrium principle. If actors in a truly free market system (something we seldom actually achieve) act in their own interests by chasing profits, these actions will ultimately lead to a societal benefit through the satisfaction of demand at the point of optimum economic value. While we may never reach a truly optimal point of economic exchange of value, we certainly see the benefit of decreasing prices and increasing quality (especially in technical terms) in industries ranging from transportation to computing. My father bought an IBM PS/2 Model 25 with a 16 colour display and 10MB of storage space in the late 1980’s for around $7,000. Today, forty years later, a $70 Asian smartphone exceeds every capability of that IBM by many orders of magnitude for 1% of the cost. This is one aspect of the deflationary effect of technology that Jeff Booth discusses in his book The Price of Tomorrow.While a computing device can increase in capabilities by 100,000% while decreasing in cost by 99% in the space of 40 years, why can’t we say the same thing of the automobile?    I drive a 1977 Range Rover that cost around $14,000 when it was new. Nearly 50 years later, the current model of Range Rover costs about 10 times that amount but delivers only marginally increased capabilities. Why did automobiles not experience the same technological deflationary effect as computers? In large part because the cost of the raw materials to produce a car including steel, aluminium, copper have all increased in that same time frame. In addition, the cost of running a factory to produce cars and the cost of transporting a 2 tonne vehicle from manufacturing to the point of sale have all gone up significantly in that period of time. While you can’t get a comparable Asian SUV brand new for $14,000 today, you can get a very capable SUV for about twice that amount with significantly greater comfort and technical features versus my spartan 70’s off roader. In 1977 the most basic VW Beetle cost around $3,000. Similar low-end cars today from Asian manufactures with similarly sparse specifications tend to be around the $6,000 price point. What is hard to see with these numbers is the inflationary effect of the devaluation of currency – in this case the US dollar. A dollar in 1977 effectively had the spending power of $5.19 today or, said another way, a 2024 dollar has the same spending power of $0.19 in 1977. That is an 80% reduction in spending power. This means that a $6,000 basic car in 2024 would be priced at $1,140 in 1977 dollars. By the way, the $7,000 dollar IBM would have cost over $35,000 in 2024 dollars making the $70 smartphone an absolute steal! What is it about a computer that allowed its technical deflationary effect to so far outpace inflation while the automobile could not achieve the same result? In short, the reason is twofold: energy and the scarcity of resources. It takes about 278kWh of energy and 120g of raw materials to produce one smartphone. A car takes around 17,000kWh of energy and 5,000,000g of raw materials to be produced (according to MDPI). Both products will end up with a similar profit margin for the manufacturer of roughly 10%. While technology can solve a lot of challenges of efficiency or miniaturisation, it cannot fundamentally reduce the quantity of physical and energy commodities that need to go into the production of something the size of a car. In the same way, bitcoin has a fundamental cost of production that is driven by the amount of energy required to produce one bitcoin. While we are continually making progress with respect to the efficiency of the machines we use to convert energy into bitcoin (we have seen an increase in efficiency of around 83% from 2019-2024), the growth of the network hashrate has still driven up the amount of energy needed to produce 1 bitcoin to around 800,000kWh. That sets the intrinsic value of a Bitcoin produced in late 2024 at around $66,000 including a profit margin of roughly 10% for the average producer. Does that mean that the current price of bitcoin is determined solely by the cost of producing a bitcoin? Of course not; but it does play a critical role in setting the value of a bitcoin. The cost of production and the current market price have reached a point of equilibrium where the producer is able to make enough margin to continue to produce in their own self interests while the market is able to benefit from a fairly priced product. The amazing thing about the bitcoin network is that it is one of the only true free-markets in existence. Absent the ability for an actor to monopolise or governments to exert control over the market, the invisible hand will continue to push these two forces towards this state of equilibrium. This means that we can understand the true value of a bitcoin by understanding the cost of the energy required to produce a bitcoin. In this way, energy effectively values bitcoin.Since I have already brought you into my worldview of thinking about most things from the perspective of a Land Rover, let me continue with that approach as we consider the other side of this Joule Paradox. As I said, I drive a 1977 Range Rover (what is now referred to as a Range Rover Classic Suffix D). I bought the truck here in Kenya about 5 years ago for right around $5,000. It was completely intact, unmolested, and 100% rust free. It was the equivalent of what is often referred to as a barn find – a perfect specimen for a functional restoration. In the Kenyan market I paid a bit above the going rate for a similar car due to its condition. If I were to attempt to purchase a similar vehicle in the UK market (assuming you can find a rust-free example still) it would have cost me significantly more. Fully restored in original condition in Kenya the truck might be worth $15,000 on the best day, a perfectly restored example in the UK would likely cost 10 times that amount. Why is there such a disparity in the value of two essentially identical things? In short, it is because of the isolation of economies. The economic pool that I have to work within here in Kenya does not value this vehicle the same way that the economic pool in the UK does. If I could just send the truck across my Starlink connection to the UK, I could make a lot of money from this arbitrage opportunity. However, vehicle shipping doesn’t work like that. For me to move this truck from my Kenyan economic pool to the UK economic pool would require a tremendous amount of time (dealing with government paperwork on both ends), transportation expense, and a multitude of unforeseen expensive issues in making sure that the quality of my Kenyan-performed work would meet the far more rigorous requirements to operate a vehicle in the UK. Would it make financial sense? Possibly. Is it economically worth the effort for me? Definitely not. Plus, I really love the truck so I emotionally over value it.Energy suffers from this same isolation of economies. If a natural gas producer in West Texas is trying to sell electricity into their regional pool at the same time that the wind is blowing and the sun is shining across the state, the value for their unit of energy can actually go negative. This means that they would have to pay someone to take their energy. At the very same point in time, someone charging their electric car in California may be paying a peak-demand surcharge for electricity that doubles their cost of energy. The Californian Tesla owner would very much love to have cheaper energy from Texas and the Texas producer would love to charge even a few cents for their power to anyone that would buy it. Unfortunately, these two energy pools operate in isolation. You can’t move a joule of energy from the Texas pool to the California pool without a lot of government paperwork and transportation costs. The arbitrage opportunity can’t be realised.   Rural power station with bitcoin mining in Zambia.   The same is true for a small hydro energy producer in Northwestern Zambia, they are isolated in a very small economic pool. They can produce more energy than they can sell to the local community but there is no one else other than the community to buy their electricity. Even if they offered it for $0.01, no one would take it. Meanwhile, 100km away, another village is being charged nearly $1.00 per kWh to get electricity from a solar mini-grid. Those villagers would love to have some cheap electricity. Unfortunately, you can’t move a joule of energy across 100km of bumpy, dusty African roads. The arbitrage opportunity is lost due to economic isolation.Although I doubt that Satoshi thought about it this way, the bitcoin mining network is effectively an adapter to connect any isolated energy pool into a global marketplace. By simply plugging in a mining machine and connecting it to the internet, you can now sell your electricity to an always willing buyer. These two simple pieces of technology allow for energy pools to be linked in a way that hasn’t really existed before. Bitcoin is a non-government-controlled, internet-enabled, real-time energy market that is open 24/7, 365 days a year.At any point in time, the invisible hand of the market will determine what is the going hashprice. This is the amount of bitcoin paid to a miner for submitting 1TH/s of compute power for 1 day. This value represents how much a miner can earn from running their machines and – thanks to mining pools – this amount is payable in very small units of work. If you run a 100TH/s machine for 1 hour then you will earn 1/24th of the hashprice paid directly to your bitcoin wallet. This is true anytime of the day and from anywhere on earth. Using this hashprice and knowing the efficiency of your mining machine, you can know with absolute certainty how much the bitcoin network is willing to pay you for any kWh of electricity that you want to sell. As an example, as of 7:34am East Africa Time on October 5th, 2024, the bitcoin network will pay you $0.078 per kWh if you are using a 24J/T Whatsminer M50s and $0.103 per kWh if you are using a 18J/T Antminer S21. Those numbers will fluctuate with the change in bitcoin price, but then it is up to you to decide if you can get a better offer from your local economic pool. Willing buyer, willing seller as they say.   By acting as the real-time marketplace for internet-enabled energy, the bitcoin network allows us to complete the Joule Paradox: energy sets the value of bitcoin and bitcoin sets the value of energy. Notice that I said value and not price. An old friend of mine used to frequently say that price is what you pay and value is what you get. The same is true here. The value of a bitcoin is based upon the energy inputs and production costs but the market determines the price. Similarly, bitcoin determines what the minimum value for a unit of electricity is but the seller determines whether they will accept that price or sell to someone else for more. In thinking about the relationship between bitcoin and energy within this paradox, we start to see why the proof-of-work model that Satoshi chose to implement and the system of automated market regulation through the difficulty adjustment is so genius. If either of these features was missing from bitcoin then we would not have the highly valuable asset that we have today. It all comes back to this simple realisation, energy is the fundamental, base commodity upon which everything of value is produced and bitcoin is the most pure embodiment of energy in a monetary form. If we took the energy out of bitcoin then bitcoin would be no better than any other fiat system of money. Remember that when someone tries to tell you that ethereum is the more environmentally friendly cryptocurrency. Energy is the true source of value and no other monetary system is built on energy.This is a guest post by Philip Walton.

Bitcoin Magazine,The Money Isn't Fixed Yet,"Thu, 05 Dec 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/the-money-isnt-fixed-yet,"A finite supply cap is not the only think necessary to fix the monetary system, money seizure and surveillance are fundamentally much bigger problems to solve.","      Well we did it, 100k Bitcoin is here. I’m sure quite a lot of you are quite happy with where your net worth is at right now, and all of you in that situation have had to exert a large amount of self control in order to hold onto your coins in order to get to that position in the first place. All of you are here because you initially got lucky, you found Bitcoin at the right time, you had someone you trust introduce you to it, the right confluence of events coalesced at the right time to get you to take it seriously. That’s not why you stayed, why you held through everything. That took your own effort and choice. But the reason you wound up here in the first place is luck. I think it’s important to keep that in mind. It’s a combination of luck and your own effort that got you this far, it’s not exclusively just you and your brilliance or iron will. It’s the confluence of both.This really is a point of no return, and a big shift in what is going to happen going forward. Problems are going to get harder, they aren’t going away just because we are all that much wealthier now. With more money come more difficulties, more challenges we are going to have to face. And more money is going to bring in even more people, all of which are going to have to be convinced that these problems exist. Convinced that the solutions to them are things we have to act on. Fix The Money, Fix The World. That phrase does have a kernel of truth to it, but the reality is the money isn’t fixed yet. A finite supply cap is not the only problem with money. There is the ability for your wealth to be seized, surveiled, controlled. Those problems are not fixed simply because Bitcoin exists with its finite supply. To fix those problems, Bitcoin actually has to scale. We need the network to be accessible to enough people that it prevents coins from accumulating in a handful of massive custodians that are trivially capturable by regulation. Without that, your money will be seizable. It will be surveillable. None of those problems will be fixed. So don’t let this price landmark distract you from that. Check your ego, and keep a realistic perspective. Things are not fixed yet just because of a number on a screen, not even close. There is a lot more to do before these fundamental problems with money are a thing of the past. This article is a Take.

A cypherpunk experiment started as magic internet money is now the 7th largest asset globally, surpassing a $2 trillion market cap. But make no mistake — we're just getting started. 2025 will be the year of Bitcoin. $100K feels like the mere beginning.This is my 3rd Bitcoin bull market after entering in 2016. From experience, the party is still early. Here's why I think $100K Bitcoin is just the tip of the iceberg:Trump hasn't taken office yet. The next couple years, especially his first year, will likely bring very pro-Bitcoin and crypto regulations.The US hasn't started stockpiling BTC yet. When it does, it will put every country on notice to adopt bitcoin ASAP.Historically, the year after the halving pumps the most as supply shrinks. We're now post-2024 halving. You do the math.More public companies are adopting bitcoin treasuries. This trend will accelerate exponentially in 2025.Some US states have presented legislation to hold bitcoin in reserves. More are expected to follow.Putin is now actively talking about Bitcoin, passing pro-crypto laws in Russia and allowing national Bitcoin and crypto mining. Global adoption is brewing.With a pro-Bitcoin US President aiming to make America the global Bitcoin capital, you better believe we're going past the moon. Game theory says other nations must compete and buy BTC or risk irrelevance.So no, $100K isn't the ceiling. I'd be shocked if we don't surpass historical multiples this cycle, especially as nation-state adoption kicks into high gear. The show's just getting started.Happy $100K, but remember this is only the beginning, my friends. 2025 will be Bitcoin's breakout year as it cements itself as the global reserve asset.

(Author's note: In this Take, I offer an interpretation of recent events in Guatemala through the lens of someone on the ground in the country.)On November 10, the X account for El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office posted the following meme:  The meme that spread like wildfire in Guatemala.  It seemed harmless enough. I know I didn’t think too much about it when I came across it. I remember laughing when I saw it and then just going about my day.However, a week ago, a colleague of mine, a prominent Guatemalan Bitcoiner, shared with me that the meme went viral in Guatemala. And not just a bunch of retweets-type viral — more like wildfire viral.Many Guatemalans, particularly Guatemalan Bitcoiners, are fans of Bukele. So, when the Bitcoin Office jokingly signaled that Bukele is thinking of buying Guatemala, the reaction from many in the country was essentially “good.”This put the powers that be in the country on their heels, catalyzing higher ups in the Guatemalan government and at Guatemala's central bank to start researching Bitcoin.My source tells me it's possible that this could result in the Guatemalan government and central bank acknowledging bitcoin's value and offering proper guidance for banks and other institutions that may want to hold the asset on their balance sheets.I plan to speak with more people on the ground in the coming weeks to provide more substantial reporting.This article is a Take.

It was literally worth $0.The price of bitcoin first broke over $100 in April of 2013 and was captured on film as it rose to an all time high of $111. Later that year in December, BTC rose dramatically higher hitting a new all time high over $1,000.

It is now no longer a question of if Bitcoin will achieve this, but when. When it comes to Bitcoin as a store of value, it has won. It’s off to the races from here, any price action is now possible. And one can only assume that going from $100,000 to $1,000,000 is going to be a lot easier than going from $0 to $100,000.During this rise to $100,000, Bitcoin has cemented itself as a legitimate asset, and everyone who has taken any meaningful amount of time to research and understand it is buying more. Everyday people around the world have adopted it for savings, payments, and financial privacy, nation states have adopted it as legal tender and are passing very pro-Bitcoin legislation, and now Wall Street firms are joining in. For someone who has been around for 7 years in the Bitcoin world, it feels unreal.Congratulations to all the bitcoin holders, old and new, on achieving this milestone. For those who have been HODLing through the bear markets, educating themselves on why Bitcoin is so important, accumulating BTC and ignoring the FUD, and onboarding new Bitcoiners — I salute you. You deserve this and all the gains that have been made on this journey. This was not easy, you did not get lucky. It takes conviction and strength to be able to buy and hold this extremely volatile asset long term.

Bitcoin Magazine,"Fed Chair Jerome Powell Is Correct: Bitcoin Is In Competition With Gold, Not The Dollar","Wed, 04 Dec 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/fed-chair-jerome-powell-is-correct-bitcoin-is-in-competition-with-gold-not-the-dollar,Powell said bitcoin is digital gold.,"     Follow Nikolaus On 𝕏 Here For Daily Posts  Today, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, said in an exclusive interview with CNBC that Bitcoin is in competition with gold, not the U.S. dollar.BREAKING: 🇺🇸 Fed Chair Jerome Powell says #Bitcoin is a competitor to gold, not the US dollar. pic.twitter.com/YQHFiThTBo— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 4, 2024  “People use bitcoin as a speculative asset — it’s like gold,” Powell said. “It’s just like gold, only it’s virtual, it’s digital. People are not using it as a form of payment or as a store of value. It’s highly volatile. It's not a competitor for the dollar, it's really a competitor for gold,” he added. While it sounds like he may have stumbled on his own words, saying no one uses bitcoin as a store of value when that is literally one of its most prominent use cases for it today, I agree with his overall position.As an American living in America, I do not feel that BTC is in competition with the U.S. dollar today. Myself, along with many other Bitcoiners I know, are trying to stockpile as much bitcoin as we can, using it as a store of value. When I do spend bitcoin, which I do every weekend when I buy beef at the farmers market) it’s not the bitcoin from my long term savings that I’m spending. I’m taking dollars from my bank account, buying bitcoin on Cash App, and directly sending that bitcoin to the farmer using the Lightning Network. I feel like I’m basically spending the dollars in my bank rather than bitcoin that I hoard.I prefer to spend my dollars, a depreciating asset, and save in bitcoin, an appreciating asset. Because BTC is not widely accepted where I live, I need dollars in my daily life. I am also incentivized to spend my dollars instead because I can earn more bitcoin too by using bitcoin-back rewards apps like Fold and Lolli. I also prefer to store my wealth in bitcoin as compared to gold. I don’t need gold, as I can’t spend it anywhere, and while it maintains value vs the dollar, it continues to lose value against bitcoin year after year. It makes no sense for me to hold gold. When it comes to price appreciation, why would I choose to hold a loser when I know the winner is going to continue to outperform it?I would predict that the overwhelming majority of Americans would choose the dollar over bitcoin today when it comes to a medium of exchange. Bitcoin is not in competition with the dollar today. But when it comes to choosing a store of value, gold or bitcoin, I think bitcoin is the clear winner. Although bitcoin’s market cap is still only a fraction of gold's, I believe bitcoin will continue to be seen as superior to gold. Whether Powell is aware of all of Bitcoin's properties, he's right that bitcoin is strongly viewed much more like a digital form of gold than a new monetary mechanism for payments in the United States.This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Developers Move to Gauge Consensus on Covenants Soft Forks,"Wed, 04 Dec 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-developers-gauge-consensus-covenants-soft-forks,Bitcoin has taken a notable step in its often contentious software upgrade process.,"A small, but significant development in Bitcoin’s much-debated decentralized consensus process is taking place, with some developers moving to publicly gauge sentiment of warring soft fork proposals that would augment the software rule set.  Follow Rizzo on X.https://x.com/pete_rizzo_/  More specifically, the effort began today with the creation of a page on the Bitcoin Wiki website called “Covenants Support,” whereon the network’s pseudonymous developers are able to attest as to their interest in no less than nine proposals, with a six option rating system.The effort is not affiliated with Bitcoin Core, the network’s major software implementation.Yet, it’s notable, as the process has been evoked in past Bitcoin consensus upgrades, dating back to the first soft fork, P2SH, in 2012, and continuing through the fabled Fork Wars, with SegWit, the most contested change to date, both having dedicated Wiki pages.Covenants, a method of restricting the spending conditions of specific UTXOs, has been gaining mindshare since 2021, with the introduction of OP_CTV, authored by developer Jeremy Rubin, though opinions differed at the time on the strength of the proposal and its promotion.Among those being gauged for developer sentiment are OP_VAULT, a covenants scheme aimed more specifically at custody, and OP_CAT, an alteration that would bring back Satoshi-era capabilities, like the ability to perform complex code queries. Already weighing in with their opinions are Luke Dashjr, one of the network’s longest-standing contributors, alongside newer entrants such as Jon Attack, Brandon Black, and MoonSettler. Should the effort gain traction, the page could emerge as one to watch. Bitcoin’s governance process, though much debated, has seldom conformed to a dedicated process, with some long-time contributors arguing against the necessity of a process at all. Still, the move is indicative of an overall interest among the development community in moving forward with code updates that improve Bitcoin for users, though there will likely remain debate as to the preferred update, as well as the activation method that would enable it. This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Heat Your Home While Earning Bitcoin With Heatbit,"Wed, 04 Dec 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/heat-your-home-while-earning-bitcoin-with-heatbit,Heatbit’s founder Alex Busarov has created a device that not only lets people increase their bitcoin stack while keeping their home warm but that also contributes to the decentralization of the Bitcoin hashrate.,"Company Name: HeatbitFounder: Alex BusarovDate Founded: April 2020Location of Headquarters: RemoteNumber of Employees: 25Website: https://heatbit.com/Public or Private? PrivateIn early 2020, Alex Busarov was stuck in his Shanghai apartment during COVID. To quell his boredom, he ordered an Antminer S9, a Bitcoin mining machine, to toy around with.After plugging it in, he quickly learned two things: Bitcoin miners are noisy and they run hot.While Busarov saw the prior byproduct as an annoyance, he viewed the latter as an opportunity.Fast-forward to the present day and Busarov and his team are preparing holiday shipments of bitcoin miners that run quietly and double as space heaters (as well as air purifiers) — the flagship product for his company, Heatbit.What is more, Busarov has created a product that helps to decentralize Bitcoin’s hashrate, which has become dangerously centralized.“The first kind of value that I saw in this was how to use energy for heating your home and mining Bitcoin at the same time, but then the mission started evolving as I realized the importance of the decentralization of Bitcoin mining,” Busarov told Bitcoin Magazine. “I think we’re enabling the most resilient infrastructure for Bitcoin to run on.”How Heatbit Devices WorkHeatbit devices stand at 24 inches in height and 8 inches in diameter. They’re cylindrical in shape and have a sleek finish.  Heatbit's flagship device.  Getting started with a Heatbit device is “as difficult as it is to plug in a Dyson device,” according to Busarov.After doing so, users need only download the Heatbit app and connect the device to WiFi to begin mining bitcoin.Once the device is running, using no more energy than a Dyson space heater and making no more noise than a whirring sound at the volume of whisper, it points the hash power that it produces to a default mining pool, which is currently NiceHash and soon to be Luxor. Users will eventually also be able to choose their own mining pool or search for Bitcoin blocks without being part of a pool if they please.“Basically, you can start without even knowing what a mining pool is,” explained Busarov. “But once you learn a little more or if you already know about mining pools, you just plug in the details for the mining pool you want to join, or solo mine.”Busarov clarified that the functionality to choose your mining pool or to mine solo hasn’t been enabled for all users yet, but it will be in the near future.“We don’t have any intention to lock users into a particular pool,” he said.If the device runs 24/7, it mines approximately 700 sats per day, which equates to approximately 20,000 sats per month — about $20 per month as per bitcoin’s price at the time of writing.The sats earned are held in a smart contract until the amount reaches a certain threshold (which is currently between $10 and $20 worth of bitcoin) before they’re deposited into the user’s wallet address on the Bitcoin base chain.Busarov is aware that some users are concerned with Bitcoin fees rising, which is why he and his team are working on implementing Lightning.“Lightning is definitely coming,” said Busarov. “It's not enabled yet, but it's coming.”Decentralizing The HashrateAs Busarov mentioned, it wasn’t his original intention in creating Heatbit devices to contribute to the decentralization of the Bitcoin hashrate. However, once he began considering just how centralized it is in some regards, he acknowledged this deeper dimension of Heatbit’s value proposition.“When you have five big mining companies and 20 well-known mining locations, if you want to damage Bitcoin, you know those 20 locations, right?” cautioned Busarov.“Also, if the price of Bitcoin goes down a lot, which happens sometimes, and the mining companies are overleveraged, they might not exist anymore,” added Busarov regarding the risk of major mining companies going bankrupt.“But people will still use the heaters, because they're not spending any extra money to mine this way. They will still use their miners because they're not losing any money, which makes it the cheapest way to mine.”At first thought, Busarov’s claim that the home miners he’s built can play a legitimate role in supporting the Bitcoin network seems a bit hyperbolic, especially considering the fact that the amount of hashrate Heatbit devices currently produce is infinitesimal compared to the amount that major mining companies produce.However, when one considers the size of the home heater market, Busarov’s assertion seems a bit more believable.“There's about 200 million electric heaters being sold every year,” said Busarov, referring to the market Heatbit is looking to capture in the long run.In the short term, though, Busarov understands that the buyers in that market don’t necessarily have the money for a space heater like a Heatbit, which retails for $799.“Most people wouldn't buy an $800 heater,” he explained. “We're looking into making a more affordable version so that we can sell more.”Prioritizing affordability has taken a back seat to focusing on quality and timeliness, however. Busarov and his team have been putting all of their efforts into making a durable and dependable device that they can ship with haste.Built To Last, Ready To ShipThe current iteration of Heatbit devices is the product of a tremendous amount of R&D as well as the sourcing of quality parts from over 70 different suppliers.In other words, Busarov and his team have built a device that can take a beating. (Not that you should beat your Heatbit device; we don’t condone home Bitcoin miner / home heater abuse here at Bitcoin Magazine.)“Today, I was doing some testing of the devices for the latest batch,” said Busarov.“I put one into the box and was literally throwing it around. I was throwing it like UPS or FedEx might, and I took it out to find that it didn’t break,” he added.Busarov shared this information with a smile, one seemingly half born from my reaction to his account of how he tests the resiliency of his products and half derived from the faith that many in the Bitcoin community have come to have in him.“When we started building, it was taking longer than expected,” explained Busarov, adding that he and his team were operating under pressure as customers had preordered devices.“Some people would complain about a delay in shipping and ask for refunds, and we refunded the money, but then a lot of people said, ‘Hey, guys, you're doing a great thing. We believe in you. Keep going,” he added.“When people say something like that to you, you can't stop. When there’s so much faith and trust that people place in you, that gives you so much energy and motivation to keep going.”Keep going Busarov and his team did, eventually creating a dependable product that’s now ready to ship en masse.The Future Of HeatbitBusarov hopes that when major household appliance companies see what Heatbit has created, they become interested in building similar products.“I think once we show that this is possible, more companies will come to it,” he said. “It will start getting really interesting when companies like Dyson and Samsung and the major electronics companies start looking into this,” he added.“Imagine Samsung starts producing home devices — not necessarily space heaters — but other home devices that do mine at scale.”Busarov has also been keeping an eye on developments in the open source Bitcoin mining movement, and has been in touch with one of its leaders: Skot, the founder of Bitaxe. He’s looking at what he might be able to incorporate from that movement, while staying conscious of the fact that he’s building a consumer product for which safety is paramount.“I really like the open source Bitcoin mining movement, and I hope we'll be able to contribute to it,” said Busarov.“That being said, we need to be careful, because heaters use a lot of power and it can be dangerous for people to just play with them,” he added.As a final thought, Busarov reiterated that he doesn’t believe he’s simply building an innovative product for the average consumer, but that Heatbit is playing a role in shaping the future of Bitcoin mining.“Bitcoin mining is not going to be about these huge warehouses using loads of energy and then these big companies having to sell the bitcoin they mine to pay for the energy they use and their operational costs,” he explained. “With home mining, you don’t have to sell any of the bitcoin you earn.”"
Bitcoin Magazine,Want Another Bitcoin Country? Do Something About It.,"Tue, 03 Dec 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/want-another-bitcoin-country-do-something-about-it,"For the first time in history, you have the opportunity to support a presidential candidate who wants to put her country on a bitcoin standard.","     Follow Frank on X.  Bitcoin is its own network state, to borrow a term from Balaji Srinivasan. That is, while Bitcoin proponents aren’t bound to one geographical region (quite the opposite, actually) they have collective power and can enact change.We just saw some version of this power exercised in the U.S. political sphere, as the Bitcoin (and crypto) lobby fiercely supported pro-Bitcoin candidates in the recent U.S. election cycle. Because this lobby was so strong, many pro-Bitcoin candidates were elected or re-elected into positions of power.One could argue that Trump won the election because he embraced Bitcoin, while Harris could only seem to muster up the ability to make lukewarm, offbeat statements about being pro-crypto (statements that some at Bitcoin Magazine found inauthentic and even borderline offensive).Now, there's another opportunity for the Bitcoin community to rally behind a candidate. For the first time in the history, a country has a presidential nominee who’s running on the notion of putting her country on a bitcoin standard. That country is Suriname and that candidate is Maya Parbhoe.Parbhoe understands the transformative power of bitcoin and believes that making it legal tender can help get Suriname’s 600,000 citizens out of “survival mode,” as she puts it.So, my question to you as a Bitcoin enthusiast is this: Do you want to watch as Parbhoe attempts to make history or do you want to play a role in helping her make it?In other words, are you going to contribute to her campaign — as Bitcoin allows you to do from anywhere in the world permissionlessly — or are you going to be a spectator?🚨 Corruption has no place in our future!We can't keep trusting a system that deceives us.It's time to act!Verifying every action is the key to a Suriname free of corruption.Your support is crucial. https://t.co/rBQxhqq7zm #maya2025 #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/hkXZislsAl— Maya Parbhoe (@MayaPar25) November 23, 2024  (You can track how donations are spent here.)You can also reach out to Parbhoe's campaign via hello@maya2025.com to offer support in other ways if you feel so inclined.The election takes place in May 2025, and Parbhoe and her team are currently gearing up for campaign season (including obtaining the funds to campaign). It’s hard to say just yet how much of a shot she has at winning, but she'll likely have less of one without your support.So, if you’d like to see the Bitcoin network state include another nation state, you have the opportunity here to play a part in potentially making that happen.(Author's note: Please keep in mind that this piece is not necessarily an endorsement of Parbhoe but a call to action for those who support her.)This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Why Bother Trying To Scale Bitcoin?,"Tue, 03 Dec 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/why-bother-trying-to-scale-bitcoin,"Bitcoiners need to find a balance between pessimism and optimism when looking at Bitcoin's future, rather than embracing one or the other to an extreme.","      The public discussion around scaling in the last few years has become poisoned and captured by an incredibly toxic and defeatist attitude: “Why bother?”“Why bother trying to scale? Basic napkin math shows it's impossible no matter what we do for everyone to self custody.”“Why bother trying to scale? People are stupid and lazy anyway, even if we did people would just use a custodian anyways.”“Why bother trying to scale? I’ve got mine, I’ll be rich enough for self custody, who cares about the stupid and lazy plebs anyways?”This attitude is permeating the entire space more and more as time goes on, with a plethora of different rationalizations and reasons for it depending on who you talk to. It is a completely defeatist, dystopian, and pessimistic view of the future. I say that as someone who is incredibly pessimistic about a large number of issues that I see in this ecosystem. Talking yourself into losing is one of the fastest ways to wind up losing. Bitcoin as a distributed system depends on being dispersed enough, and having enough independent system participants, that it can resist the coercive or malicious influence of larger participants. This is critical to it continuing to function as a decentralized and censorship resistant system. If it cannot remain dispersed enough in its distribution then natural tendencies in networks will likely gravitate towards larger and more dense participants until they effectively have an outsized control over the whole network. That will ultimately very likely spell the end for Bitcoin’s most important property: censorship resistance. What is mind boggling to me is, even though we aren’t in a perfect place, we have made massive progress in the last decade. Ten years ago we had people screaming about raising the blocksize. Now we have the Lightning Network, Statechains, and now Ark. We have people experimenting with wildly improved federated custodial models using BitVM. We even have a vague inkling of ways to implement covenants without a softfork if some new cryptographic assumptions pan out and prove practical to implement in a usable way. Even if we do bump into a ceiling eventually we can’t get around, every bit of ground we gain means room for more people to self custody. It means more room for more custodians, allowing more numerous small scale ones to enable people to custody with people they trust more than disconnected corporations, for that more numerous herd to impose greater competitive pressure for custodians in general. To maintain that wide dispersion of entities directly interacting with the network that it needs to maintain its decentralization. Why are so many Bitcoiners willing to throw up their hands and give in to defeatist sentiment? Yes, we have more problems to solve than we did ten years ago, but we have also covered a massive amount of ground in expanding scalability in that ten years. This isn’t a binary situation, this isn’t a game where you win or lose with no middle ground. Every improvement to scalability we can make gives Bitcoin a higher chance of success. It entrenches and defends Bitcoin’s censorship resistance that much more. I’m not saying that people should naively buy into every promised solution or hyped thing, there are definitely problems and limitations we should remain cognizant of. But that doesn’t mean throw in the towel and give up this early. There is so much potential here to actually reshape the world in a meaningful way, but that won’t happen overnight. It won’t happen at all if everyone just gives up and kicks back expecting to get rich and apathetically stops caring about it. Blind pessimism and blind optimism are both poison, it’s time to start looking for a balance between the two rather than picking your drug of choice and sinking into delusion. This article is a Take.

Bitcoin Magazine,Is Bitcoin Self-Custody Under Threat in Europe?,"Tue, 03 Dec 2024",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/is-bitcoin-self-custody-under-threat-in-europe-,A look at current regulation changes taking shape in Europe that could threaten Bitcoiners' ability and right to self custody.,"For centuries, self-custody has symbolized financial autonomy, enabling individuals to secure their wealth—from gold to cash—without intermediaries. Bitcoin extends this principle into the digital realm, offering a censorship-resistant, decentralized way to hold assets. Yet, upcoming European regulations under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) and the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) threaten to complicate self-custody for Bitcoin users.A New Regulatory EraMiCA, adopted in April 2023, aims to regulate crypto-assets comprehensively in the EU. The revised TFR applies the “Travel Rule” to Bitcoin transactions, requiring detailed sender and recipient information for compliance. These changes will come into effect in 2025, making it harder for Europeans to interact with Bitcoin self-custody wallets without cryptographic proof of ownership.One proposed solution is the “Satoshi Test,” where users verify wallet ownership by sending a small amount of Bitcoin (e.g., one satoshi) from their wallet to the exchange. While simple for existing holders, this process creates a paradox for new users: they need Bitcoin to verify ownership but cannot acquire Bitcoin without passing the test. This “catch-22” risks alienating new adopters, steering them toward custodial solutions that compromise Bitcoin’s ethos of decentralization and financial sovereignty.Privacy and Security RisksIn an effort to comply with the new regulations, some exchanges are exploring alternatives to the Satoshi Test; These involve using end-to-end encrypted messages signed using the private key to confirm ownership of the wallet cryptographically for example via the WalletConnect Network. This preserves privacy and yet helps institutions to be compliant.The core ethos of Bitcoin technology and cryptocurrencies is decentralization and privacy. Centralizing sensitive user data not only creates attractive targets for cybercriminals but also contradicts the principles that have driven the adoption of cryptocurrencies. The recent history of data breaches in the financial sector underscores the dangers of storing large amounts of personal data in centralized repositories.“Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins”The adage ""Not your keys, not your coins"" serves as a reminder of Bitcoin’s core philosophy: control over private keys equals control over assets. Users must carefully evaluate exchanges' self-custody support, as cumbersome processes or centralized data storage undermine Bitcoin’s promise of financial freedom.The TFR is only the beginning. Future legislation, like the proposed Payment Services Directive 3 (PSD3), signals growing regulatory scrutiny of Bitcoin self-custody. To preserve Bitcoin’s core values, the industry must proactively develop solutions that comply with regulations while protecting user privacy.This is a pivotal moment for Bitcoin in Europe. Users should advocate for exchanges that prioritize self-custody and privacy-preserving measures. Exchanges, in turn, must innovate to comply with regulations while staying true to Bitcoin’s decentralized principles.As Europe tightens its regulatory framework, the choices made by Bitcoin users, exchanges, and regulators will determine whether Bitcoin continues to empower individuals or becomes entangled in centralized systems. By championing privacy and self-custody, we can ensure Bitcoin remains a tool for financial sovereignty and freedom.This is a guest post by Jess Houlgrave.

So far, that hasn’t really been any of the soft fork proposals.","     Follow Aaron on Nostr or X.  As I explained in a Take two weeks ago, I think the threat (or promise, depending on your perspective) of protocol ossification is somewhat exaggerated, at least at this point in time.Yes, the rate of soft forks has slowed down significantly over the years, the last one having been Taproot in 2021. But it seems this has more to do with a lack of interest in the potential upgrades that’ve been proposed since then, rather than it being due to the lack of a good process for deploying protocol upgrades. (Although that is not exactly a solved problem either.)Bitcoin Core developers are generally funded on a no-strings-attached basis or outright volunteers, meaning they’re not required to work on any specific part of the codebase. As such, their time and energy will be dedicated to whatever they find most interesting or important to work on. So far, that hasn’t really been any of the soft fork proposals: the various covenant-style opcodes aren’t unequivocally perceived to offer the type of groundbreaking use cases that deserve prioritization, and while Drivechains sound great in theory, their major downside is still that miners can ultimately steal coins from them.But even if Bitcoin Core developers aren’t interested, that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to upgrade Bitcoin. For better or worse, anyone with the right skillset (admittedly not a very low bar) can always deploy a soft fork through an alternative client, even as a user activated soft fork (UASF). Yet, despite some rumblings from time to time, no one has done this yet.I suspect this is at least in part because the proponents of these soft forks aren't convinced a UASF would actually be successful. And if a UASF wouldn’t be successful, maybe the upgrade is not worth doing in the first place...This article is a Take.

Donald Trump’s re-election victory and the massive success of the Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year have been major catalysts behind Bitcoin’s ascent towards $100,000. Gains over the last few weeks have been driven by the anticipation of Trump 2.0 making the US the ‘crypto capital of the world’ and a financial services industry getting its first real taste of ‘number go up’.  While the full details are yet to emerge, the number of Bitcoiners in Trump’s inner circle – including D.O.G.E. head Elon Musk – suggest Trump could come good on his crypto election promises. Fostering a more accommodative approach to banking, self-custody, and digital assets could have massive global knock-on effects. The success of the Bitcoin ETFs did much to destigmatize Bitcoin amongst institutional investors; US government support would likely do the same thing amongst governments.   A pro-Bitcoin administration will almost certainly drive prices higher and result in more countries following suit. In my Bitcoin pitch, I always avoided the end game to people in suits—institutional investors, regulators, and policymakers—but suddenly, hyperbitcoinzation and hash wars look entirely possible.  What does this mean for Bitcoin first movers like El Salvador? Or the Bitcoin curious like Argentina? It’s hard to say. On the one hand, as the largest contributor and shareholder in the IMF, a more accommodative US stance on Bitcoin would likely end the IMF’s opposition to things like El Salvador’s 2021 Bitcoin law. On the other hand, it could steal a lot of thunder from smaller economies, leveraging Bitcoin to attract human and financial capital.  Capital markets, though, are a different game. I’ve often said that the opportunity to monetize Bitcoin-based capital markets is naturally skewed to small to mid-sized economies. Bitfinex Securities is registered and licensed not in New York, London, or even Singapore but in El Salvador and Kazkahstan’s Astana International Financial Center. Two jurisdictions that not only have buy-in from the highest echelons of their respective governments, but maybe even more importantly, are places where financial services account for a very small proportion of GDP. There are fewer moats and less pushback from entrenched players in legacy markets.  It’s a good bet.  Lots of upside and minimal downside.  The tokenization we have seen in financial hubs and by major financial institutions to date looks to me like token tokenization. Earlier this month, UBS Asset Management launched a USD Money Market Investment Fund built on Ethereum. The fund “seeks to open the door to the world of decentralized finance, reduce barriers and provide access to products and services to a broader range of market participants, bringing them closer together”, but is also only available through authorized distribution partners. This seems like corporate buzzwordery. More smoke and mirrors.  Authorized distribution partners sound like the antithesis of decentralized finance.  A number of the big banks have built proprietary tokenization technology. HSBC, for example, has Orion. UBS has Tokenize. Goldman’s has the Goldman Sachs Digital Asset Platform. Most (maybe all) of these solutions limit participation to institutional and/or accredited investors, settle either in fiat or a CBDC, offer no integration with Bitcoin or Tether, and rely on the usual host of conventional capital market participants like transfer agents, custodians, and depositories with no effort at disintermediation. The future of finance looks a lot like the past.   This, I think, is the opportunity for El Salvador and other countries like it: streamline capital markets, disintermediate technologically unnecessary roles, support self-custody and peer-to-peer trading between whitelisted counterparties, allow for broad market participation and encourage links between conventional and digital asset markets through Tether and Bitcoin. This could yield an alternative to conventional capital markets that allows issuers and investors to interact much more directly and is cheaper, faster, and more inclusive.  Wall Street’s approach seems to focus almost exclusively on the efficiencies of tokenized securities while overlooking the opportunity to streamline markets, return more control to investors, or encourage participation in capital markets from a broader range of investors and issuers.  I think it’s mostly about firing the back office and improving margins. Regardless of Trump’s Bitcoin strategy, it’s difficult to imagine tokenization in major markets, weighed down by layers of incumbents and vested interests, following the El Salvador model. They seem to want innovation without change. I think a race between the competing approaches to tokenization will emerge in the coming years, fuelled in part by a more digital-assets-friendly US administration: developed vs. developing economies, open source vs. permissioned chains, inclusion vs. institutional only, Bitcoin and Tether vs. CBDCs and fiat. It’s much too early to say which path will emerge as the dominant approach, but I think there’s a good chance that freer, cheaper, lower friction markets can come out on top.

Onchain data reveals that loans against Runes accounted for 57% of Liquidium’s daily volume, contributing 12 BTC, while Ordinals accounted for the remaining 43%, contributing 9 BTC. These numbers reflect a year-long upward trend for Liquidium, which has facilitated over 63,000 loans totaling more than 3,378 BTC. Runes dominate the platform, comprising over half of all collateral. Liquidium enables users to borrow Bitcoin against assets like Runes, Ordinals, Inscriptions, and BRC-20 tokens. Its non-custodial model employs Discreet Log Contracts (DLC) for secure escrow, ensuring that lenders’ returns are protected, even in default cases. The rise in Liquidium’s activity mirrors Bitcoin’s increasing mainstream adoption. Analysts point to BTC’s price rally above $100,000 and the introduction of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as key factors driving institutional interest in the ecosystem. Additionally, market sentiment has dramatically improved with expectations of crypto-friendly regulations under a Donald Trump-led US administration, fueling optimism for broader industry growth. Moreover, the platform’s native LIQUIDIUM token is also enjoying an uptrend, according to CoinMarketCap data, which has pushed its value up over 25% during the past week. New features Looking ahead, Liquidium is set to launch features designed to streamline user experience. A new instant loans feature will allow borrowers to access funds without requiring lender countersignatures, simplifying the process for loans of any size. The upcoming Custom Loan V2 upgrade will introduce a gallery-like interface, enabling borrowers and lenders to create and customize loan offers. This shift from the traditional model — where only lenders could initiate offers — will make the platform more dynamic and accessible. The intuitive design promises an engaging experience where users can explore loan opportunities as effortlessly as browsing a curated collection.

There is no reason other than to pander to generous special interest campaign contributors.” His remarks follow reports that President-elect Donald Trump’s Crypto Advisory Council is expected to establish the “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” The idea of a national Bitcoin reserve surfaced during the Bitcoin 2024 conference earlier this year, where both Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made keynote speeches, along with several lawmakers, including Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), who introduced the “Bitcoin Act” legislation proposing the creation of such an institute at the event. Bitcoin reserve idea gaining traction The idea of creating Bitcoin reserves is gaining traction beyond institutions now, with lawmakers and politicians around the world warming to the concept.  Satoshi Act Fund founder Dennis Porter recently revealed he is in discussions with Texas state officials to introduce legislation for a strategic Bitcoin fund. Additionally, on Nov. 14, Representative Mike Cabell introduced a bill to create a BTC reserve in Pennsylvania using the state’s $7 billion fund. Porter said Texas and Pennsylvania are the first of many and claimed that up to 10 more US states will likely follow suit before the year ends in an attempt to front-run the Trump administration’s plans for a federal Bitcoin reserve. The examples in the US are motivating politicians in other countries. A Brazilian lawmaker pushed for a Bitcoin reserve in the country through legislation introduced on Nov. 26, which would allocate up to nearly $19 billion in BTC. Meanwhile, Poland’s libertarian presidential candidate, Sławomir Mentzen, wants to allow the country to hold BTC as a strategic reserve.

In its latest report, the bank attributed Bitcoin’s surge past $100,000 this year to unprecedented institutional inflows and projected a clear path for further growth. Growing interest StanChart’s head of digital assets research, Geoffrey Kendrick, highlighted that institutions acquired 683,000 BTC in 2024, with a significant amount — 245,000 BTC — purchased in the weeks following the US election, a period marked by heightened optimism about regulatory reform under the incoming Trump administration. MicroStrategy alone accounted for 213,000 BTC, significantly exceeding its annual target, while US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) added 470,000 BTC to their portfolios. According to Kendrick: “MicroStrategy’s pace of accumulation has exceeded expectations, and its commitment to raising $42 billion over three years indicates further significant inflows in 2025.” Kendrick said he anticipates regulatory changes in early 2025, including a repeal of SAB 121, the passage of stablecoin legislation, and leadership changes at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as pivotal for unlocking additional institutional participation. These reforms are expected to enable retirement funds and pension accounts — representing a $40 trillion market — to allocate a fraction of their assets to Bitcoin. The report noted that even a 1% allocation could drive inflows worth $400 billion, with transformative effects on Bitcoin’s price. Additionally, the report highlighted the role of sovereign wealth funds, such as Norway’s NBIM, which indirectly holds 7,000 BTC through its investment in MicroStrategy. The report also floated the possibility of a US strategic Bitcoin reserve fund, a move that could catalyze broader adoption by other global sovereign wealth funds. Lower market volatility Standard Chartered noted that the launch of Bitcoin ETF options in November has further reduced market volatility, a factor likely to attract more traditional finance players. The growing appeal of Bitcoin as a portfolio asset is reflected in metrics such as MicroStrategy’s market cap-to-Bitcoin holdings ratio, which has tripled this year, signaling excess demand. Additionally, the potential for corporate treasuries and global investors to deepen their Bitcoin exposure has increased with the success experienced by companies like Japan’s Metaplanet and Germany’s Acurx Pharmaceuticals. Both firms have made recent Bitcoin investments, while Microsoft’s board is set to vote on a similar move this month. While challenges remain, including the speed of regulatory implementation and broader adoption among conservative asset managers, Standard Chartered reaffirmed its confidence in Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. According to the lender: “Bitcoin’s limited market capitalization, relative to potential institutional demand, positions it uniquely for outsized growth.” The post StanChart updates Bitcoin price projection to $200k by 2025-end appeared first on CryptoSlate.

Crypto News,“Bitcoin Price Will Even Reach Seven Figures” – Bitcoin Suisse Founder,"Fri, 06 Dec 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-will-reach-seven-figures-bitcoin-suisse-founder/,"Bitcoin Suisse founder Niklas Nikolajsen predicts Bitcoin will hit a seven-figure price, driven by the US election and Bitcoin halving.The post“Bitcoin Price Will Even Reach Seven Figures” – Bitcoin Suisse Founderappeared first onCryptonews."," Niklas Nikolajsen, founder of Bitcoin Suisse, one of the oldest crypto companies specializing in asset storage, predicts a continued rise in the price of Bitcoin, even suggesting it could reach “seven figures.” In an interview with the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, Nikolajsen also criticized crypto regulation and politics in Switzerland and praised the US under incoming President Trump as a pioneer. US Election and Bitcoin Halving Fueling Current Bull Run According to Nikolajsen, whose fortune is estimated at 200 to 300 million Swiss francs, Bitcoin (BTC) price will continue to rise.  “The highest Bitcoin price is in the future,” Nikolajsen said, adding:   “I was one of the few who bought a lot of Bitcoin under a dollar. When it hit one dollar, my friends told me to sell. I didn’t. And I’m still saying: we are in a bull market that will last until spring. Of course there will be setbacks, but the Bitcoin price will one day even reach seven figures.” Nikolajsen explained that the US election accelerated the current bull run but pointed out that in a “halving” year, which creates scarcity in the market due to the halving of newly issued Bitcoins, a price spike towards the end of the year is typical. Nikolajsen also referred to the increasing acceptance of institutional investors and Trump’s announcement that he would buy Bitcoin as a currency reserve if re-elected.   Senator Lummis Hints at U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Echoing Trump’s Crypto PromisesSenator Lummis proposes a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the U.S. to acquire 1 million BTC to strengthen dollar and reduce the national debt.— Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 8, 2024  “If the US actually managed to buy one million Bitcoin, all players would come under pressure,” said Nikolajsen. There would be a gold rush, he predicted, not only among small investors but also among companies and governments. “The Chinese would be forced to act, as would other countries that had failed to establish their own Bitcoin reserves.” “Switzerland Is No Longer the Right Place To Start a Crypto Company” According to Nikolajsen, Switzerland should also hold Bitcoin as a currency reserve.  “It is not in Switzerland’s interest to have an institution that buys all kinds of debt instruments in the EU and loses so much money over such a long period of time,” he argued with regard to the Swiss National Bank (SNB). Instead, the SNB should hold “good assets” such as Bitcoin. Switzerland has lost ground in the area of crypto regulation, Nikolajsen said, adding that “Switzerland is still better at regulation than many EU countries, but it is certainly not a global leader”. The vision of making Switzerland a leading location for the global crypto industry “died with the personnel changes in the Federal Council”.  The Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) has lost its nerve, according to Nikolajsen, and no longer grants crypto companies banking licenses. “The authority doesn’t want crypto banks, but rather banks that “do crypto”. Unfortunately, Switzerland is no longer the right place to start a crypto company,” he added. Switzerland Still Attracts Crypto Investors Though no longer active in the industry since the end of 2021, Niklas Nikolajsen is still one of Switzerland’s most well-known crypto entrepreneurs.  In November, he became president of the Bitcoin Association Switzerland, an industry group aiming to strengthen Switzerland’s position as a leading hub for Bitcoin innovation. However, not all Bitcoin investors share Nikolajsen’s pessimistic opinion. In September, Billionaire investor Christian Angermayer reportedly left the United Kingdom for Switzerland’s Bitcoin hub, Lugano. With about 1,000 stores accepting Bitcoin, Lugano – a small town in an Italian-speaking region of Switzerland – is a real-world example of crypto in action. This is partly thanks to a partnership with Tether, which makes using crypto for everyday purchases easy. Since 2022, Lugano has also hosted the Bitcoin-themed conference “Plan ₿ Forum” annually.

This new rule, which takes effect on January 1, 2025, introduces a favorable tax framework for crypto investors and marks a notable shift in the country’s approach to digital assets.  No capital gains tax on bitcoin has just been passed in The Czech Republic with all members of the parliament voting for it  pic.twitter.com/i7E8aZHC2W— Kristian Csepcsar (@KristianCsep) December 6, 2024  The amendment allows individuals to exclude income from personal taxation if their annual crypto earnings are below CZK 100,000 or if their Bitcoin and other digital assets are held for over three years before being sold.  However, the exemption excludes electronic cash tokens and applies only to assets not part of business holdings for at least three years after self-employment ends. Hold Your Bitcoin Longer, Pay Less Tax: Czech Republic’s New Crypto Rules Explained These changes align Bitcoin taxation with traditional financial instruments like stocks.  Consulting firm BDO highlighted that the amendment mirrors existing exemptions for securities transfers, imposing an aggregate limit of CZK 40 million on gains from securities, business shares, and crypto transactions. Under the current tax system, Bitcoin transactions are taxed at a flat rate of 15% for individuals and 19% for businesses.  Higher-income individuals—those earning above CZK 1,935,552 (approximately $81,579)—face a steeper 23% rate.  Without transitional provisions, assets acquired before 2025 may qualify for these exemptions when sold under the new rules. Despite these clarifications, questions remain about how taxpayers can confirm the duration of ownership and whether all types of digital assets fall under the scope of the exemptions.  The Income Tax Act currently lacks a precise definition for digital assets, leaving room for interpretation. Experts Praise Czech Bitcoin Tax Reform but Call for Clarity Crypto experts, including KPMG, noted that the amendment builds on principles already familiar in securities taxation.  BTC Prague reported unanimous support for the law, emphasizing its potential to encourage long-term Bitcoin investments.

Stakeholders have also urged Czech authorities to issue further guidance to eliminate uncertainties surrounding the new framework.

Crypto News,Bitcoin Reserve a “Bad Deal for Americans”: Bill Dudley,"Fri, 06 Dec 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-reserve-a-bad-deal-for-americans-bill-dudley/,"Former NY Fed President Bill Dudley cautions that creating a federal Bitcoin reserve could strain public finances, drive up inflation, and provide limited benefits to most Americans. He highlights Bitcoin's volatility, capped supply, and economic risks, urging policymakers to focus on regulation instead.The postBitcoin Reserve a “Bad Deal for Americans”: Bill Dudleyappeared first onCryptonews."," Bill Dudley has raised concerns about the potential creation of a federal Bitcoin reserve, warning of financial and economic risks tied to such an initiative. In a recent opinion piece published in Bloomberg, Dudley, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 2009 to 2018, highlighted challenges with a government-backed Bitcoin reserve. Limited Benefits, Significant Drawbacks “Bitcoin has some positive attributes,” said Dudley. “It can be transferred to anyone, anywhere without relying on government-regulated banks or other traditional financial intermediaries. And adding it to a portfolio of stocks and bonds might provide some diversification benefit.”  Should the US government buy 1 million Bitcoin? Absolutely not, says former New York Fed President Bill Dudley https://t.co/i2Zr7asRn6— Bloomberg Opinion (@opinion) December 6, 2024  Despite these merits, Dudley argued that creating a federal Bitcoin reserve would likely cause prices to skyrocket, benefiting current Bitcoin holders rather than the broader economy.  He emphasized Bitcoin’s capped supply and absence of income generation, describing it as a speculative and volatile asset. Dudley further explained that funding such an initiative would come at a high cost.  Financing Bitcoin purchases through debt or money creation would either increase the national debt or exacerbate inflation.  He compared this to monetizing debt, an approach that carries serious economic risks. He also questioned Bitcoin’s practicality as a government asset, citing its slow transaction speeds, high energy costs, and lack of guaranteed acceptance as major drawbacks.  Instead of pursuing a Bitcoin reserve, Dudley urged policymakers to focus on regulatory frameworks that address issues in the cryptocurrency market.  He advocated for measures to protect consumers, prevent illicit activities, and promote the safe development of blockchain technology. Florida Could Launch Bitcoin Reserve in Q1 2025 While Dudley criticized the concept of a federal Bitcoin reserve, some states appear to be moving in a different direction. According to Samuel Armes, President of the Florida Blockchain Business Association (FBBA), the State of Florida could launch its own Bitcoin reserve as early as the first quarter of 2025.   @samuelarmes of the Florida Blockchain Business Association says Florida could establish a Bitcoin reserve by Q1 2025. #USCrypto #FloridaCrypto #BitcoinReservehttps://t.co/P1RINJQEPK— Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 6, 2024  Armes suggested that Florida’s pro-crypto leadership, including Governor Ron DeSantis and lawmakers Danny Perez and Ben Albritton, may explore using the state’s pension fund and budget surplus to invest in Bitcoin.

Samuel Armes Pushes for Florida Bitcoin Reserve in 2025 In a December 3 X post, Armes proposed that allocating just one percent of Florida’s $185.7 billion pension fund into Bitcoin could yield a $1.857 billion reserve.

Armes further suggested that Florida could allocate one percent of its $116.5 billion budget surplus—equivalent to $1.165 billion—toward Bitcoin investments.  He expressed confidence in the state’s legislative landscape, stating, “My organization will advocate strongly for this, alongside three additional pro-Bitcoin bills in the upcoming legislative session.” Pro-Bitcoin Leadership and Market Momentum Florida currently possesses a number of key state leaders who are pro-Bitcoin and could help push a Bitcoin reserve bill into reality, including Speaker of the House Danny Perez and Senate President Bill Albritton. Governor Ron DeSantis has also been a staunch defender of Bitcoin, particularly against the prospect of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). “Unaccountable institutions cannot impose a CBDC on Americans,” he said in an April 2023 X post. “They will tell us that CBDC won’t be abused but we are wise enough to know better.” Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), a long-time advocate for a national Bitcoin reserve, appeared to endorse Florida’s potential initiative.   States are the incubators of great ideas. It’s a race to the top and welcome the friendly competition.  https://t.co/7eqN9JlQq8— Cynthia Lummis  (@CynthiaMLummis) December 4, 2024  “States are the incubators of great ideas,” Lummis said in a December 4 X post. “It’s a race to the top, and we welcome the friendly competition.” Bitcoin’s recent market performance has added momentum to the conversation.  The cryptocurrency surpassed the $100,000 mark this week, buoyed by growing mainstream adoption and the approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year. President-elect Donald Trump has also contributed to Bitcoin’s rising prominence, having pledged to establish a national Bitcoin stockpile over the summer.  However, states like Florida may move ahead first, setting the stage for decentralized adoption at the state level. As Bitcoin continues to gain traction, Florida’s efforts to establish a cryptocurrency reserve could serve as a blueprint for other states considering similar initiatives.  Whether through pension funds, budget surpluses, or legislative support, the Sunshine State is positioning itself as a key player in the growing Bitcoin economy.

Crypto News,WikiLeaks’ Afghan War Logs to Be Permanently Archived on Bitcoin Blockchain,"Fri, 06 Dec 2024",https://cryptonews.com/news/wikileaks-afghan-war-logs-to-be-permanently-archived-on-bitcoin-blockchain/,"WikiLeaks is launching Project Spartacus to permanently inscribe 76,911 Afghan War Logs onto the Bitcoin blockchain, ensuring accessibility and protection against censorship using the Ordinals protocol, starting December 12, 2024.The postWikiLeaks’ Afghan War Logs to Be Permanently Archived on Bitcoin Blockchainappeared first onCryptonews."," Julian Assange’s monumental 2010 release of the Afghan War Logs marked a turning point in transparency, revealing classified details of US military operations during the Afghanistan War. According to a recent report by The Block, a new initiative now aims to ensure these records remain permanently accessible by inscribing them onto the Bitcoin blockchain via Project Spartacus. This ambitious effort involves encoding 76,911 files from the Afghan War Diary into Bitcoin’s decentralized ledger, utilizing the Ordinals protocol to safeguard the data against censorship or loss.  Assange’s supporters and family spearheaded the move as part of WikiLeaks’ mission and its long-standing relationship with Bitcoin as a tool for resilience. WikiLeaks’ Afghan War Logs: How Can Bitcoin Blockchain Guarantee Immortability? Source: Screenshot from WikiLeaks The Afghan War Logs, first released by WikiLeaks in 2010, provide a detailed account of military operations between 2004 and 2010.  They expose troubling aspects of the war, including civilian casualties and controversial interrogation practices. Despite public availability, there remains a persistent risk of suppression or erasure due to the politically sensitive nature of the content. To address this, Project Spartacus will inscribe the logs onto the Bitcoin blockchain using OrdinalsBot to ensure permanence.  Unlike traditional digital storage, which relies on centralized servers, Bitcoin’s decentralized network distributes data across thousands of nodes globally, making it nearly impossible to alter or delete.   Gabriel Shipton, Assange’s brother and chair of the Assange Campaign, remarked: “This information should last forever.”  The minting process, set to begin on December 12, 2024, will be free for participants via ProjectSpartacus.org and later continue on the OrdinalsBot marketplace, Trio.  Given the volume of data, the mint is expected to span multiple Bitcoin blocks, creating one of the most extensive and technically complex blockchain projects to date. A Symbol of Resistance and Legacy Bitcoin played a crucial role in supporting WikiLeaks during its financial blockade, during which major payment processors denied service to the organization.  Donations in BTC kept WikiLeaks operational and proved decentralized systems’ resilience in the face of state-level suppression.   Assange’s early engagement with Bitcoin even drew attention from Satoshi Nakamoto, the cryptocurrency’s enigmatic creator. In 2010, Nakamoto expressed concern over WikiLeaks’ use of Bitcoin, fearing it could bring unwelcome scrutiny to the nascent technology.    Nakamoto wrote in a Bitcointalk forum post: “WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet’s nest, and the swarm is headed towards us.”   Despite this initial hesitancy, Bitcoin became a lifeline for WikiLeaks as a tool for censorship-resistant currency. A “Forever Iconic” Endeavor Using the Ordinals protocol makes it easy and the best option to permanently archive the logs. Ordinals allow data to be inscribed onto individual satoshis—the smallest unit of Bitcoin—creating immutable records directly tied to the network’s ledger.   Toby Lewis, founder of OrdinalsBot, described the project as a “forever iconic” endeavor. However, he acknowledged the challenges posed by the scale of the mint, which involves tens of thousands of files.  Lewis noted: “This isn’t a 10K collection.” He added that the infrastructure is designed for large-scale mints but still anticipates some delays.   While the initiative is not intended to raise funds for Assange—who continues to seek a full pardon from U.S. President Joe Biden—it provides a way for supporters to engage with his legacy.  Shipton emphasized that the project serves as a reminder of Bitcoin’s original purpose, to be a weapon against systemic constraints. “It’s one of the strengths of Bitcoin — being able to withstand resist state-level attacks and keep publishing.” The post WikiLeaks’ Afghan War Logs to Be Permanently Archived on Bitcoin Blockchain appeared first on Cryptonews.

According to the Financial Times, an IMF mission is in San Salvador to negotiate terms that would likely remove the requirement for businesses to accept Bitcoin, making adoption voluntary. The pending deal, which awaits IMF board approval, may also unlock $1 billion in lending from the World Bank and another $1 billion from the Inter-American Development Bank, bolstering access to external credit after a period of relative isolation. This approach marks a shift in the country’s pioneering stance on Bitcoin as legal tender, introduced in 2021. The IMF consistently opposed mandatory acceptance of the digital asset, citing risks to financial stability, and previously urged President Nayib Bukele’s administration to scale back crypto-related policies. Head of Digital Assets Research at Van Eck, Matthew Sigel, commented,  “Even if El Salvador makes Bitcoin acceptance voluntary, it remains legal tender—like the Euro in Montenegro, currencies in British Overseas Territories, and Canadian dollars, which merchants can refuse in large amounts. Such flexibility is a common global practice.”  El Salvador’s new terms will reportedly include a commitment to reduce budget deficits by around 3.5 percentage points of GDP over three years through a mix of spending cuts and tax measures. Plans also call for the passage of an anti-corruption law and raising reserves from $11 billion to $15 billion. Bukele, who was re-elected this year with a broad mandate, has worked to shift international perceptions of El Salvador’s economic management. The dramatic crackdown on violent gangs had dominated the country’s image, now coupled with efforts to attract foreign investment and reposition its financial status. Per the Financial Times, officials close to the negotiations believe the new arrangement signals a return to more conventional lending relationships with the IMF. While the government positions itself as a global pioneer of Bitcoin integration, reports suggest many Salvadorans continue to rely on the US dollar, with just 12% using Bitcoin for transactions. Bukele’s attempt to promote Bitcoin as a cornerstone of growth, including announcements of a “Bitcoin City” powered by geothermal energy, has drawn widespread attention. However, the voluntary acceptance clause under the proposed IMF deal acknowledges limited domestic appetite for everyday Bitcoin use. El Salvador has Bitcoin reserves worth over $600 million, underlining efforts to tie national economic policy to Bitcoin returns. A formal announcement of the IMF package in the coming weeks would represent a significant change in El Salvador’s unwavering Bitcoin support to this point. However, with the potential for the US to also create a strategic Bitcoin reserve following Trump’s inauguration, it will be interesting to observe the IMF’s response to such legislation by a global powerhouse like the United States. Alongside the IMF development, Bukele commented that it plans to sell gold aggressively to dilute its price in favor of Bitcoin. Speaking on “trillions” of gold reserves reportedly in El Salvador, Bukele stated, “We’ll dilute that thing like there’s no tomorrow ” The post El Salvador required to remove mandatory Bitcoin acceptance to get $1.3 billion IMF loan – FT appeared first on CryptoSlate.

The proposal, submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), seeks to encourage Amazon to adopt Bitcoin as a financial hedge and value driver. Why Bitcoin makes sense for Amazon The proposal argued that Bitcoin could protect Amazon’s $88 billion in cash and short-term assets from inflation. The group raised concerns about the Consumer Price Index (CPI), often used to measure inflation, arguing that it underestimates actual inflation rates, which could be twice as high. With cash losing value and bond yields falling short of actual inflation, the proposal suggests that Bitcoin offers a more resilient alternative. Bitcoin’s performance further strengthens the case. Over the past year, Bitcoin has risen by 131%, significantly outperforming corporate bonds by an average of 126%. While Bitcoin is known for its volatility, the proposal noted that Amazon’s stock has also experienced fluctuations throughout its history. Yet, this volatility has not deterred Amazon from maximizing shareholder value in the long term. The proposal urged Amazon to evaluate Bitcoin as a viable treasury asset, emphasizing that even a modest 5% allocation could enhance shareholder value. By diversifying its balance sheet, Amazon could hedge against inflation without exposing itself to excessive risk. The NCPPR argued that such a move aligns with the company’s fiduciary responsibility to secure and grow shareholder wealth over time. Considering this, the firm stated: “Shareholders request that the Board conduct an assessment to determine if adding Bitcoin to the Company’s treasury is in the best long-term interests of shareholders.” Expanding Bitcoin use Meanwhile, industry leaders have proposed that Amazon incorporate Bitcoin payments into its operations. Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao suggested the company could build a Bitcoin reserve by accepting payments in the digital asset. However, Zhao acknowledged challenges, including Bitcoin’s slower transaction speeds. Despite this, he emphasized the top digital asset’s advantage over traditional finance, noting its seamless functionality. Satoshi Act Fund CEO and co-founder Dennis Porter echoed this sentiment, suggesting Amazon incentivize Bitcoin payments with discounts. Porter argued that such a strategy could help Amazon build a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” while promoting crypto adoption among its customers.

The acquisition, conducted between December 2 and December 8, was executed at an average price of $98,783 per Bitcoin. With this latest purchase, the business intelligence giant now holds a total of 423,650 BTC, valued at around $42 billion. MicroStrategy’s Fifth Consecutive Week of Bitcoin Purchase The latest acquisition marks the firm’s fifth consecutive week of Bitcoin investments. Just last week, MicroStrategy acquired 15,400 BTC for $1.5 billion at an average price of $95,976 per coin. The company financed the recent transaction through the sale of approximately 5.4 million shares of its common stock, part of a broader $21 billion equity offering authorized in October 2024. MicroStrategy plans to raise $42 billion over the next three years, with the funding split evenly between equity and fixed-income securities. Of this, $9.19 billion worth of shares remains available for future sales.

In its submission to Amazon, the think tank raised concerns over inflation’s impact on corporate reserves. It criticized the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which currently estimates inflation at 4.95%, as a “remarkably poor measure” of actual currency debasement. The organization suggested that the real inflation rate could be significantly higher, potentially double the official CPI figure. The proposal is set to be discussed at the company’s April 2025 shareholder meeting. The NCPPR’s proposal aligns with a broader push for institutional Bitcoin adoption. In October, it urged Microsoft to invest in Bitcoin through a similar letter. However, Microsoft advised shareholders to reject it, stating management already evaluates such matters. The proposal will be discussed this week at Microsoft’s annual meeting on December 10. Last week, Bitcoin’s price dip to $92,957 spurred major acquisitions by BlackRock and MARA Holdings, who collectively purchased 9,173 Bitcoin. BlackRock made the most significant move, purchasing 7,750 Bitcoin. This acquisition pushed the asset management giant’s total Bitcoin holdings to $48.9 billion. Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings added 1,423 Bitcoin in four transactions between December 5 and 6, valued at $139.5 million. The acquisitions came after the firm closed its second $850 million convertible note offering, earmarked for boosting Bitcoin reserves. MARA now holds 22,108 Bitcoin worth $2.17 billion, reflecting a staggering 162% increase in its holdings compared to last month.

The report offers an in-depth analysis of digital asset trends and predicts significant growth in Bitcoin adoption, Ethereum’s resurgence, and the integration of stablecoins into traditional financial systems.  The firm anticipates 2025 as a pivotal year for the sector, driven by increased institutional interest, U.S. regulatory advancements, and favorable macroeconomic conditions.

The report highlights Bitcoin’s growing stature as a strategic reserve asset. It projects that more nation-states will follow El Salvador’s lead in embracing Bitcoin as part of their financial strategy.  Argentina is identified as a potential candidate for such adoption. This shift indicates a broader acceptance of Bitcoin’s role beyond a store of value, as 21Shares predicts the cryptocurrency’s total value locked (TVL) will exceed $10 billion in 2025.   Moreover, according to the report, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is also set for a renaissance in 2025.  After stagnation, Ethereum’s revenue growth is expected to rebound significantly, surpassing 100% of its target. The resurgence will be driven by strategic Layer 2 integrations, which will ultimately enhance scalability and utility. Adrian Fritz, Head of Research at 21Shares, emphasized the shifting dynamics in global markets. He noted that while Europe has led the charge in digital asset adoption, the United States is rapidly emerging as a formidable player.   “In 2025, we expect the market to become even more positive towards crypto, spurred by a more favorable regulatory environment under a new administration that will likely accelerate crypto adoption, and growth for the industry at large, at a pace we’ve never seen before.” Adrian Fritz ETP and Stablecoin Growth Amid War Against Bitcoin Reserve The report also projects explosive growth for crypto ETPs, forecasting assets under management (AUM) to reach $150 billion by 2025.  The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and similar regulatory changes worldwide are expected to drive this momentum.  With institutional investors showing an increased appetite for regulated exposure to crypto assets, at least one U.S.-based Bitcoin ETF is anticipated to rank among the top 25 largest ETFs globally.   Stablecoins, often touted as the bridge between traditional finance and blockchain technology, are another focal point of 21Shares’ outlook.  These digital assets are expected to see deeper integration into public and private sectors, with nation-states, banks, and Web2 companies adopting stablecoins for various use cases. Notably, the idea of a country-owned Bitcoin reserve is gaining momentum. On Friday, December 6, a report showed that Florida is exploring the creation of a statewide Bitcoin reserve, aiming for a potential launch in early 2025.  While there has been praise, there have also been some cautions.  Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has criticized President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal to establish a national Bitcoin reserve, calling it impractical and politically motivated.  Trump’s plan involves retaining 200,000 Bitcoins from past asset seizures, and advocates suggest it could reduce the national debt through value appreciation.  Summers, however, dismissed the idea as a misplaced financial strategy, questioning why the government would accumulate Bitcoin as a “sterile inventory.”  Former Federal Reserve Bank of New York President Bill Dudley recently criticized the idea, claiming it is a “bad deal for Americans.” The post 21Shares’ 2025 Outlook Predicts More Bitcoin Adoption and Ethereum Resurgence appeared first on Cryptonews.
